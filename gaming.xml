			<p>The newly revealed Nintendo Switch 2 console could end up becoming one of the most popular gaming systems of all time, as suppliers are reportedly ready to ship a huge amount of units in the first year of availability.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>, unspecified analysts said that Nintendo suppliers are ready to ship 20 million units in the console's first year of availability, a much bigger number of units compared to the first year of other popular systems like the original Switch, and the PlayStation 5, although production of the current generation system by Sony was impacted for quite some time by shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic. With this many units, at the very least, there shouldn't be too much trouble finding the console in stores, which has apparently been one of<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/"> Nintendo's concerns</a> for a long time.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally officially been revealed today with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-february/">a trailer</a> that focused on the hardware and the differences with the current system. Besides showing off the system, the trailer also provided a quick look at what will likely be the next entry in the Mario Kart series and confirmed that the new system will have full backward compatibility with the current consoles, as it will run both physical and digital Switch games. A better look at the system will come in April with a dedicated Nintendo Direct, while a select few will be able to get some hands-on time with the Nintendo Switch 2 thanks to special experiences that will be held across the world.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-update-rafts-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Endnight Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>update, and this one comes complete with new buildable structures, support for a major Steam feature, and even a fun new secret to find.</p>

<p>Naturally, this update isn't quite as big as the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">huge 1.0 release in February last year</a>, but it does bring three new buildable raft structures, as well as a new mooring post for you to hitch your seafaring vehicles to.</p>

<p>You'll also find new buildable holders for the KnightV and hang glider vehicles, as well as a "procedural defensive wall placement system" to help you draw a more natural formation for your defensive fences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sons-of-the-forest-update-head.jpg?itok=wQGdiNzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sons-of-the-forest-update-head.jpg?itok=5OAQfPZ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you were using&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s new procedural defensive wall system, this would never have happened.</figcaption></figure><p>Support for Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta" rel="nofollow">Game Recording feature</a>, which allows you to record your game footage without ever leaving the comfort of Steam, has also been added, so you can show off your new defensive walls to all your friends.</p>

<p>What's more, there's also a new "secret player findable outfit" that you can discover somewhere in the game world. Endnight is remaining cagey regarding exactly how or where you find this item, so it's up to you to scour&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s world to claim it.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to tons and tons of new gameplay improvements and bug fixes. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes</a> for this update if you want to see everything that's new.</p>




<p><em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>is the followup to the supremely spooky survival game&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, which was released back in 2018 for PC and PlayStation 4. The sequel is only available for PC, though.</p>

<p>This time, you'll be exploring a mysterious island to try and uncover the fate of a missing CEO, although you'll quickly be drawn into the same type of shenanigans the first game offered. I won't spoil, but this certainly isn't a cozy game, let's put it that way.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1326470/Sons_Of_The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is reportedly preparing a massive amount of Switch 2 shipments for the console's first year on sale, with the figure apparently dwarfing that of the original Switch.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which, in turn, cites analyst Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein), Nintendo's supply chain network for the Switch 2 will allow it to sell "more than 20 million units in its first year".</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, that figure would be five million higher than the original Switch, which managed to sell 15 million units during its first year on sale. It's clear that Nintendo is banking on its new console doing well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=DzIoVW6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=msB6_bFT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is preparing its new console for around 20 million shipments in its first year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible the company wants to avoid a repeat of the great chip shortage of the early 2020s, which made consoles like the PS5 and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-shortage-got-you-down-build-your-own-instead" rel="nofollow">original Switch</a> very hard to obtain. It might sound obvious, but Nintendo really doesn't want you not to be able to find this console in stores.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">finally announced</a> the Switch 2 earlier today after months of speculation regarding when the console would finally be revealed.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that the announcement itself was pretty terse; it showed off the console's form factor, as well as what appears to be a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series, but it didn't give away anything about the machine's specs or launch day lineup.</p>

<p>We do, however, already know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be able to play</a> original Switch games, although Nintendo has said that the successor may not support every original Switch game at launch.</p>




<p>Nintendo has promised that it will reveal more about the Switch 2 during a Direct presentation in April. It's likely we'll learn more about the console's hardware specs then, and we'll probably get a release date too. Stay tuned.</p>

It feels unlike most of the company’s past marketing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, let’s look at the Switch 2 teaser/trailer thing real quick. I’m assuming you’ve seen it, but if not, well you are in a for a treat! </p><p>Wowza! The Nintendo 2 looks less like a toy or a big chunk of plastic designed to be unbreakable (like a lot of the company’s past consoles), and more like a modern piece of technology. This first teaser really hammers home that Nintendo wants you to salivate over how much bigger, better, and sleeker the Switch 2 is over its predecessor. </p><p>It’s also very unlike Nintendo to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">zoom in and reveal each and every port and button on the console</a></span>. Sure, it’s done in a whimsical fashion, with the new console evolving from the old one, but it’s still really cool to see Nintendo  point at tiny details and go, “Oh yeah, sweet, huh?” I also appreciate how each new button and port pops out with a tactile motion and noise. It’s good shit. </p><p>This trailer feels more like something Apple or Sony would do to reveal a new console or device; a white void background and super close shots of intricate technical aspects. But then, the controllers start driving around the shiny room and you remember that this is a device made by Nintendo. </p><p>Compare this trailer to the WiiU reveal at E3. </p><p>Or the original Switch reveal eight years ago. </p><p>Those trailers feature people playing the consoles, lots of game footage, more upbeat music, and both focus more on the experience than on the device. For the original Switch, that approach made sense. Nintendo needed to explain its hybrid device to the world.</p><p>Now, with this new sexy teaser for Switch 2, Nintendo doesn’t need to convince the world that a hybrid console is great. Instead, they can show off and tease you about how much better it is than the last one. And you know what? Works for me. I’ll be buying a Switch 2 later this year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced the Nintendo Switch 2</a> on Thursday with a short video to reveal the system. Within the teaser, the company also showed what appeared to be Mario Kart 9 (name pending) running on the system. While there was nothing to really write home about regarding the look at Mario Kart 9, one shot seems to suggest that 24-player races could be a feature of the next game in the series.</p>



<p>A keen-eyed Twitter user (<a href="https://x.com/The_Rimea/status/1879881772852490287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@The_Rimea</a>) spotted the starting grid for a race in the new game, and with it came what appeared to be 24 spots for racers. </p>



<p>“Judging from the starting line, Mario Kart 9(???) seems to have 24 players per race, which is insane,” the post reads alongside the accompanying image that you can see below. For comparison’s sake, there’s also a couple images of the starting grid from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed any details about games coming to the new Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. All that has been confirmed is that both physical and digital original Switch games will be compatible with the new system. In some instances, however, original Switch games “may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2”. </p>



<p>Nintendo is scheduled to hold a Nintendo Direct event fully dedicated to its new console on April 2. It’s expected that the company will announce full specs, a release date, price, and some launch games during the event. Insider Gaming will have full coverage leading up to and during the showcase.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Popular indie FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortunes-run/">Fortune's Run</a> won't be seeing any updates for a while--about three years, to be precise, as that's how long its sole developer, known only as Dizzie, will be spending behind bars.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have some stuff going on I need to make public as it's going to interrupt development," Dizzie <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">shared in a post</a> on the game's Steam page.

It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WGagabyqUc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7WGagabyqUc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this," he added. "I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions."</p><p dir="ltr">Described by Dizzie as a "fast-paced melee boom-shoot fighting game platformer action immersive sim role-playing fever dream adventure story," Fortune's Run's only other developer recently left the project. According to Dizzie, his former co-developer left for a number of reasons, one of which was a series of struggles she faced after what the post describes as a "botched surgery."</p><p dir="ltr">"The other developer has left the project," Dizzie wrote. "Once she recovered [from surgery], she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of QA and a few level segments, all of which have been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone, but I actually managed--by basically not sleeping--to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away."</p><p dir="ltr">"Since we decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," He continued. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p dir="ltr">The dev added that he is "no longer in financial dire straits" since Fortune's Run "actually sold OK," and noted that he "should be able to afford rent" once he's released from prison.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a chance that if you wait a few years, I'll be able to cap off the release," he wrote. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that "the game isn't <em>totally</em> dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen [to it]."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie's identity--and the crime for which he is being incarcerated--are not known to the public, though he admits in the blog post that his sentence is the result of violence on his part.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was a very violent person [in the past] and I hurt a lot of people in my life," he wrote. "Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that another Fortune's Run update is in the works and will be released before he begins serving his sentence.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah. What about the update, huh? I'm going to put that in the next news post, because it feels weird to uh, put patch notes at the bottom of this blog post."</p>

The man who wrote "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ballmetaversebook.com/">The Metaverse</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" is out this week with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">a slide deck</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> full of data and analysis capturing the economic headwinds facing the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's presentation gets to the heart of a very uncomfortable fact: according to analysts, video game spending didn't just fail to grow after the COVID-19 pandemic, it dipped 3.5 percent in 2022 and only climbed back a few percentage points by the end of 2024. Other data points, like a declining amount of playtime in games, are also enough to trigger game developers' anxiety (and mine!).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball identifies the slowing growth as being a symptom of major interlocking growth drivers of the period between 2011-2021 (when consoles and mobile devices exploded in capabilities and new social networks came online) losing steam. It's not a pretty picture, but this is a business built on solving big problems by staring them right in the face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His lengthy explanation of the complicated market effects at play might warn investors and executives from investing more in the video game business—but that leaves and opportunity for savvy developers and leaders to slip in and find victories where others retreated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have no doubt this slide deck is bouncing through the inboxes of various studios right now and sliding across the desks of different C-suite execs. If you want to make the most of Ball's data, you'll need to think about how it applies to your day-to-day life. Here are a few takeaways that might resonate with rank-and-file developers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Video game budgets have to come down">Video game budgets have to come down</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is probably thuddingly obvious to many of our readers but Ball's data makes a very clear point: video game budgets are too dang high. The amount of money invested in individual games is becoming more difficult to turn a profit on when a fewer percentage of players are picking up new games every year. "Excluding annual releases, but including sequels, only 6.5 percent of gametime in 2023 was for new games," Ball writes. "Always On" games-as-a-service titles released before 2019 earned the most "gametime" in that year. "Tens of billions in development and marketing investment and thousands of games competed for that 6.5 percent of total players hours (and four titles won half of it)."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the unfortunate poster child for Ball's breakdown here, as his breakdown of sales versus budget of the widely beloved sequel relative to its predecessors shows the heart of the problem. The series' production budget shot from just over $100 million to over $300 million across three games (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Miles Morales</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> clocked in at just over $150 million), but lifetime sales of the series haven't increased exponentially.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pair that against the small market share the series is competing for and the economics become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>rough</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I don't know the fate of the budgets for future Marvel's Spider-Man games, I do know Insomniac is aware players aren't necessarily seeing the payoff of the increased spending, a fact that came out in the frustrating dump of leaked documents obtained by hackers targeting the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now here's where things get hard: how do you reduce budgets? There are only three major tools: lower salaries, lower development time, or lower headcounts. Each has frustrating tradeoffs that in many cases, punish workers and reward executives who ballooned the budgets in the first place.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Devs need to dance with governments">Devs need to dance with governments</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's data points to two obvious ways government regulators could influence the game industry—one explicit, the other implicit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The implicit argument isn't clearly stated, and I wonder if Ball would take issue with my analysis. But reading between the lines, an understated challenge of bigger budgets is this: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>game development is hit brutally hard by the cost of living and inflation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As we discussed last year, the same number of developers you stick on a game costs dramatically different depending on the country you're operating in. Developers in higher-cost-of-living regions are being undermined by ones in lower-cost-of-living regions, and developers in the latter territories risk being exploited because they have less agency to leverage better wages.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's explicit argument targets the purported monopoly Google and Apple have on their mobile platforms. He says that if the iOS and Android app platforms need to "open up." New stores could, among other things, drive competition that lowers the 30 percent "platform fee" claimed by Google and Apple, drive new discoverability methods that connect players to a wider variety of games, and spark innovation for new genres of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both topics may require industry leaders to grit their teeth and press local and national governments in support of regulatory action. Industry lobbying groups to date have largely focused on tax breaks and legislation surrounding the import cost of parts and access to internet bandwidth. That's a lot of work invested into legislation that primarily benefits the world's largest publishers and studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington">Mr. Smith</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's time for video games to go to Washington (or London, Ottowa, etc. etc.).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Players respond to exciting &quot;new genres&quot;—but where do new genres come from?">Players respond to exciting "new genres"—but where do new genres come from?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of new game genres, Ball's analysis concludes that the emergence of new game genres could be a shot in the arm for the video game market place. He points to the era of the battle royale genre's as being the kind of event that can drive new growth. The industry, he says, could use a shot of innovation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His suggestions for where new genres might come from are concentrated on possible technological advances in "mass concurrency," "high-bandwidth data streaming," "higher-persistence game worlds," and "cloud native games." His analysis of generative AI also focuses on the technology's potential to introduce new genres, as some developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/hidden-door-ceo-ai-controversy-is-about-value-not-tech">like those at Hidden Door</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are experimenting with.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's technology-focused thinking isn't out of place, as many previous industry advances came out of graphical and rendering advances. But there might be a missing variable here: unpaid modding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many breakout new genres of the 2010s began life as mods (born of unpaid labor) for entirely different games. That goes for MOBAs, battle royale games, tactical shooters like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Counter-Strike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That trend muddies of the waters of where developers can find true innovation that will land with players—and who benefits from it. Valve and Blizzard jumped into action to try and profit off genres built on mods of their games. Meanwhile, Brendan Greene was lucky to find a business partner that could turn his </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ARMA 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">mod into a full game, but Epic Games fast-followed with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so hard it became the defining version of the genre in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A bubbling example of this phenomenon right now might be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s roleplaying servers. Their popularity speaks to Ball's analysis that the next generation of video game players prioritizes social play over competition, and right now Rockstar Games is the beneficiary of unpaid time and labor from players setting up their own mini improv theaters. Will Rockstar build on this audience after the release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Will other developers swoop in to try and eat their lunch?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Video game analysts from the early 2000s have a fair bit of egg on their face as one of the few bright spots for the traditional video game marketplace is consistent growth in the world of PC games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/study-pc-gaming-hardware-market-down-not-out">Declining sales around 2010</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> led some to think consoles and mobile would inevitably beat out PC games, which were (and sometimes are) difficult and fiddly to get running.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Twenty years ago, PC's share of non-mobile console spending was 29 percent. It's now 53 percent," writes Ball. "And while console [spending] has stagnated since 2021, PC has grown 20 percent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you jump out of your desk and greenlight another generation of flight simulators, you should check out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>why</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> PC spending is growing. "The largest share of Steam users now use Chinese as their default client language (which probably </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>underrepresents</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> China's total share of Steam users)," says Ball.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additional data he shares shows that Chinese client language users are among the group that has grown the most on Steam from December 2021 to September 2024. This group represents what many publishers hope to reach—a "fresh audience" with different tastes and interests than the more calcified existing market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But while Chinese player spending on video games has grown by $39 billion since 2011, only 20 percent of their domestic spending goes to imported titles. Spending on imported titles </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>declined</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> five percent from 2023 through 2024. Ball compares this phenomenon to one also taking place in the film industry: locally-made entertainment is outpacing imported entertainment across the globe in China, Nigeria, and India.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Box office hits like Wandering Earth, A Tribe Called Judah, and RRR are cinematic cousins of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">entertainment produced by local artists that are wildly popular in their countries of origin and also find audiences abroad.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As foreign markets grow, their domestic production capabilities and supply grow too, and this always results in national preferences then shifting to local product," Ball observes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's opportunity for the game industry to meet this moment. We've seen rustling from South Korea about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">expanded interest in triple-A </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">games alongside the country's longtime passion for free-to-play multiplayer titles, and regions like Brazil and Eastern Europe are following similar trends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're not in those regions, you might wonder how your neck of the game industry can benefit. For now, the best I can offer is that if overseas audience spend more time on consoles and PCs than mobile devices, developers have an opportunity to catch some of that interest by investing in localization.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding player socialization should be a priority">Understanding player socialization should be a priority</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Woven through Ball's analysis is another long-running trend: how players and why socialize through games is changing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> phenomenon, for instance, isn't just about younger players being drawn to blocky graphics and user-generated content, it's that the platform's flexible tools have become a haven for self-expression and social play. We can again look at the proliferation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> roleplaying servers as another data point in this phenomenon, and outside of games, the increasing growth of chat platform Discord.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One in five Discord users (or 40 million total) use the app to stream gameplay to their friends each month—and just under one in three watches monthly," Ball notes. It's a piece of social glue that accelerates interest in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Smite 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phasmophobia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord's list of users playing Steam Early Access titles as a share of total observed players is largely loaded with co-op multiplayer games, but also features single-player titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fields of Mistria, Hades II, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Ball describes this as "disproportionate" game discovery behavior.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers behind these games probably didn't do any weird science studying the habits of Discord users (unless they did, in which case, hey reach out to me I want to know what you learned), but enough of them have succeeded on the platform in a way that suggests studying how players engage with and use Discord might be a vector for developers to grow, explore new genres, and succeed in 2025 and beyond.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(And Discord may not deserve all the credit here—social apps across the globe likely drive similar behavior in different regions).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do developers handle an uncertain future?">How do developers handle an uncertain future?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'll be honest here. When I first read Ball's report, I came away with some degree of anxiety. The human brain struggles to wrangle numbers like these, and it's easy to spiral into an unhelpful spree of if-&gt;then statements that make a decline in billions of dollars in spending feel like the end of the world. The problems and solutions are so big and abstract that if you aren't a big-money decision maker—just a humble programmer, artist, designer, or a writer like me—you can feel like you have no agency in a field you deeply love. And even if you have the power to greenlight a game, what if the games Ball is proposing aren't the ones you want to or even can make?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The solution, I think, is to look at Ball's data and analysis as a map. Maps don't serve one purpose—they lay out the territory as best they can so another traveler can navigate it. Plenty will read Ball's map and see "X marks the spot" where others will see "here there be dragons."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You don't have to change or fix the game industry. But to make the game you want to make, having a map handy might keep you from sailing into dangerous waters.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony Pictures has released the first full trailer for its Until Dawn horror film.</p>
<p>Earlier this week a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-teaser-reveals-how-its-replaced-the-games-branching-narrative">teaser was released</a> that hinted towards how the game's branching narrative would be replicated in the film.</p>
<p>Now, in this full trailer, we can see how the plot revolves (literally) around an hourglass with the cast repeatedly waking up after gruesome deaths to try their luck at surviving once again.</p>

<p>Though the plot differs from the original game - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">features a new cast</a> - there are plenty of horror tropes: from the haunted house setting, masked slayers, and chases thwarted by bear traps, to creepy zombie-like monsters and a particularly nasty looking face infection.</p>
<p>"Every night holds a clue," the trailer reads. "Every death brings you closer to the truth."</p>
<p>Then: "If we want to survive, we have to make it until dawn," says one character nodding. He said the name!</p>
<p>The film is set to release exclusively in cinemas on 25th April.</p>
<p>As for the original game, it received a PS5 and PC remake in October last year and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel"> includes a new ending</a> that points towards a possible sequel.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, Nintendo<a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finally</a> announced the Switch 2, or at least showed a console that looks a lot like everyone thought it would and set a Direct with more details for April. The hardware-minded among us are certainly rushing to analyze every frame of the trailer, but I am a simple man with a simple complaint: I still want to slide in the Joy-Con.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the trailer above, you can see that instead of sliding the Joy-Con into place from the top of the console like the current Switch, they click in from the sides. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-reportedly-revealed-in-alleged-image-leak-and-internet-sleuths-are-trying-to-work-out-what-it-all-means" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> wrote of an alleged leak of the controllers back in January that “[the] new Joy-Con allegedly ditch the railed lock method used by the current Switch in favor of electromagnetic suction controllers,” though in the trailer there appears to be a connector.</p><p>We’ll know more about how and why this all works in April, but if you’ll allow me to engage in the internet-old tradition of complaining about things I don’t know much about, I don’t like it! I want to slide the Joy-Con. Is it the best connection system in the world? No. Some players have found that the rail <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/rci8im/tips_to_protect_the_console_rails_from_bending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bends</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/q8zgrt/switch_oled_joycon_wobble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wiggles</a>, and it’s certainly not a seamless glide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But still, sliding the Joy-Con in feels like the aesthetic heart of my experience of the Switch, a stance that’s backed up by the animation that opens every <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKlRN2YpxRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch game</a> trailer of a Joy-Con sliding into place vertically. In those trailers, this is accompanied by the sharp “click” that’s triggered a Pavlovian response in me ever since the initial Switch reveal. In today’s trailer, that “click” is replaced by a rounder, somewhat echoey sound. Of course, neither of these are what the actual Joy-Con sound like, and the latter might just be an aesthetic choice for the trailer rather than a new “official” Switch sound.</p><p>This raises some obvious questions: Is Nintendo going to make a new animation? Are we going to get a new Switch sound? I will grudgingly say that change is good because that’s how therapists advise me to think about life, but aren’t we facing enough change these days? I like the little animation. I like the little click. I like to slide my Joy-Con into place like I’m dropping into a world-defining battle in the <em>Power Rangers</em> mech before I spend a whole evening giving people gifts in <em>Stardew Valley</em> when I should be doing something else.</p><p>Fine, fine–change <em>is</em> good, and hopefully the Switch 2 makes many much-needed improvements. While I like to slide the Joy-Con in to connect it, it can be a little annoying to detach; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> writes that it’s possible the new design will allow a button press to push the Joy-Con away from the console instead of clumsily sliding it back out, which sounds much nicer. There’s no mention in the trailer of fixes for Joy-Con drift, but I suppose I’m willing to sacrifice my beloved slide in exchange for a controller that reliably does what I want it to. There’s speculation that the Joy-Con can be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used like a computer mouse</a>, which is… I don’t know, cool I guess? Time marches forward, and things change, and perhaps a new generation will look at old Switch trailers with their slide animation with the same bafflement of my little nieces and nephews when I make a “hanging up the phone” gesture in front of them.</p><p>RIP, Joy-Con slide.

<p>The playtest will take place between February 12th and 17th, and unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta</a> (and, indeed, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">one prior to that</a>), you'll have to request access in order to be approved for the test.</p>

<p>Sharkmob doesn't specifically say which aspects of the game you'll be granted access to if you manage to get approved for the beta, so it sounds like you'll be able to test a slice of the game, which is exciting if you're an extraction shooter fan, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=OPeg2gwx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=0wPd3OKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing the&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for 60 minutes will earn you two extra keys, allowing you to recruit a couple of friends and "complete your squad", as Sharkmob says.</p>

<p>As for what the game actually is, Sharkmob describes&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world tactical extraction shooter set in a world torn apart by extreme forces of nature". An apocalyptic cataclysm (is there any other kind?) has ravaged the world, making resources scarce and hostile humans numerous.</p>

<p>You'll be let loose in the "vast open land" of Colton County, and it'll be up to you to scavenge for loot, deal with warring factions and enemy players, and try to survive when nature's fury comes a-calling once more.</p>

<p>If you want to know what&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>looks like on a moment-to-moment level, you can check out the playtest announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Between this, shooters like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">Escape from Tarkov</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players" rel="nofollow"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and experiments in other genres like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access" rel="nofollow">Dungeonborne</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service" rel="nofollow"><em>Project Pantheon</em></a>, the extraction genre sure is gaining popularity.</p>

<p>Whether&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>can stand out in a landscape like that remains to be seen, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a> if you want to find out. That's also where you can request access to February's playtest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvelous has announced the release date for upcoming farming RPG adventure&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which will allow you to explore a "Japanese-inspired" land filled with unique twists on classic&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. There's no word on whether it'll also be released for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">newly-announced Switch 2</a>, but since that console is backwards compatible, I suppose the answer is technically "yes".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will take place in the land of Azuma, which are "a shadow of their prosperous past" following the events of a mysterious calamity known as the Celestial Collapse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=BEGzDpb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=bYhHC9rC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>brings more cozy RPG farming goodness in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The gods of nature have abandoned the land, but one hero makes a pact with a dragon in order to use its power to save the world from its encroaching blight. That, in case you hadn't twigged, is you.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose from one of two protagonists, whose destinies are "closely tied together", according to Marvelous.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will also offer "reimagined and expanded&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay", meaning you'll be able not only to farm, but also to fight using new weapons like bows and talismans, as well as befriending local villagers and exploring the land of Azuma to your heart's content.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which shows the kind of direction the game is going in, right here.</p>




<p>You won't just be farming in&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, either; you'll be rebuilding entire villages, constructing and placing buildings as you see fit. It's a wonder you can find the time for romance in between being an adventurer and a city planner.</p>

<p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345133/sony-until-dawn-movie-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Sony has been saying that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343454/sonys-until-dawn-movie-wants-to-channel-games-dust-yourself-off-and-try-again-energy">upcoming <em>Until Dawn</em> feature</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337875/sony-playstation-horizon-zero-dawn-helldivers-2-ghosts-of-tsushima-movie-tv-show=PlayStation">one of its new IP adaptations</a> — is meant to channel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4">the game’s spirit</a>. But the movie’s latest trailer makes it pretty clear that this isn’t just going to be a one-to-one translation.</p></div><p>Similar to the game, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/16/world-premiere-of-the-until-dawn-movie-trailer/">director David F. Sandberg’s <em>Until Dawn</em></a><em> </em>revolves around a group of people who find themselves trapped in a time loop that resets as they’re each murdered in a number of different horrific scenarios. When Melanie (Maia Mitchell) goes missing under mysterious circumstances, her younger sister Clover (Ella Rubin) recruits her friends Max (Michael Cimino), Megan (Ji-young Yoo), Nina (Odessa A’zion), and Abel (Belmont Cameli) on a mission to find her. In the trailer, group’s search brings them to what looks to be an inn run by Hill (Peter Stormare), an odd man who warns them that wandering farther up the road will only bring trouble into their lives.</p><p>Though one seems all that bothered by how the weather acts strangely around Hill’s inn, they know something is up when their car vanishes, and they find Melanie’s signature written in a dusty old guest log. Things only get spookier as night falls, and <em>something </em>starts lurking in the darkness around Clover and her friends. But it isn’t until people start dying that they realize they’re somehow being resurrected and challenged to survive until the morning as various ghouls try to kill them in inventive ways. </p><p>The trailer makes it seem like, despite revolving around new characters, it’ll hit many of the classic <em>Until Dawn </em>beats<em>. </em>And when the movie hits theaters on April 25th, it’ll probably keep audiences guessing as to who exactly is going to make it out alive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Grinding Gear Games has <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3695606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced full details</a> for Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1, including releasing the full patch notes. The update, which will be available for players on Friday, features hundreds of changes and bug fixes to Skills, Monsters, Endgame content, controller support, and more.</p>



<p>You can check out the full Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 Notes below. The game is available now, in early access, on Steam. </p>



<h6 id="h-more-insider-gaming-nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year">MORE INSIDER GAMING: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Announces Nintendo Switch 2, Launching This Year</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-patch-0-1-1-notes">Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 Notes</h2>



<h3>Endgame Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added 4 new Tower Map areas: Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire.</li>



<li>The Lost Towers Map area has also been revamped.</li>



<li>To address the problem of only having one attempt at the Arbiter of Ash Boss fight, you will now have up to six respawn attempts at this fight. Respawns can only be triggered by the person who put in the keys, and everyone in your party will be respawned at the same time. Leaving the Map still forfeits your attempt so you’ll still need to fight the boss with the build you walked into the Map with. Higher difficulties of the Boss will lower the number of respawn attempts you receive. We’ll be looking to add respawn attempts to other Pinnacle content over time.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash can no longer be interrupted during his falling flame seed skill. His flaming gale skill can no longer be blocked.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash Boss is now invulnerable for longer during its emergence and now takes significantly reduced damage while emerging.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash is now way less likely to target minions when using his sword, which could prevent some of their skills being used.</li>



<li>Added checkpoints to Map areas.</li>



<li>Map areas now contain a minimum of 3 Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Citadels can now appear closer to the Ziggurat Refuge.</li>



<li>Improved the visibility of Citadels on the Endgame Map.</li>



<li>Maps now display their Biome when hovered in the Atlas UI.</li>



<li>Added the new Overseer’s Precursor Tablet, a currency item which can be placed in completed Towers to add Map Bosses to valid Maps in radius. These tablets drop from Map Bosses, and can roll exclusive modifiers that affect Map Bosses.</li>



<li>Map areas have been adjusted to have more distinct specialities for the content they contain. For example, one Map area might have more total number of monsters, while another is more likely to contain additional content such as Strongboxes, Essences or Shrines. Generally speaking, the more difficult a Map is to clear, or the smaller it is, the more axes it will specialise in. Here’s an overview of changes we’ve made to give Maps more discernibility:</li>



<li>A number of Maps now spawn up to double the number of Chests, and twice as many minimum Magic or Rare Chests.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain up to double the number of Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Magic Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have a higher minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have a lower minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Essences.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Strongboxes.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Shrines.</li>



<li>Maps that are only exclusively found in Biomes containing Citadels now have 50% more chance to contain Essences, Strongboxes and Shrines.</li>



<li>Unclaimed Hideout Areas now have substantially more Magic Monsters, and fewer Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Monsters in the Untainted Paradise have been breeding. Untainted Paradise now contains 100% more Monsters, of which spawn 100% more (thus quadruple) Magic and Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Improved the highlightability/clickability of Shrines.</li>



<li>Reduced the damage scaling of Monsters in Simulacrum encounters with added Difficulty.</li>



<li>Adjusted the chance for Maps to contain Bosses, you should be encountering a Boss roughly every 1 in 4 Maps.</li>



<li>The chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher has been reduced to account for the increase in total number of Map Bosses.</li>



<li>The Radiant Waystones Atlas Notable Passive now provides +15% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 25%).</li>



<li>The small Map Boss Waystone Chance Passives now provide +6% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 10%).</li>



<li>The “I’m not afraid of you!” Delirium Atlas Passive Skill now grants “Delirium Bosses in your Maps drop 100% increased Simulacrum Splinters” (previously 50%).</li>



<li>Reduced the number of monsters and small chests from Breaches by 15%.</li>



<li>Increased the amount of Simulacrum Splinters found in Maps by 20%.</li>



<li>Added dedicated 2D art for Waystones that are instilled with layers of Delirium.</li>



<li>Crisis Fragments, Breachstones, Simulacrums, and An Audience with the King now have a more appropriate gold value to vendors.</li>



<li>Increased how far you can zoom out on the Endgame Map on keyboard and mouse input, to match the zoom level on controller input.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Skill Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Supercharged Slam now has “Each successive aftershock gains +0.5 metres to radius, up to 3 metres (previously uncapped).</li>



<li>Scavenged Plating now grants you stacks for a duration based on the enemy’s rarity. Normal enemies grant 1 stack, Magic enemies grants 2 stacks, Rare enemies grant 5 stacks, and Unique enemies grant 10 stacks.</li>



<li>The Lightning Bolt Skill granted by the Choir of the Storm Unique Amulet has been renamed to Greater Lightning Bolt to differentiate it from the Skill granted by Staves. Triggered Greater Lightning Bolts are now unable to trigger a subsequent Greater Lightning Bolt if the first was a Critical Hit. Greater Lightning Bolt now deals roughly 3.5 times more base Lightning Damage compared to Lightning Bolt.</li>



<li>The Temporalis Unique Body Armour can no longer reduce the cooldown of a Skill to below 100ms.</li>



<li>Skills socketed in a Meta Gem’s sockets can no longer gain energy.</li>



<li>Clarified Vine Arrow’s description to explicitly state that it hits enemies on landing.</li>



<li>Removed the Aura tag from Pain Offering for consistency with other minion skills, as the skill does not directly create an Aura (the Aura is created by the summoned minion).</li>
</ul>



<h3>Monster Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Monsters now have increased Toughness per Essence modifier affecting them.</li>



<li>Added a small delay before monsters released from Essence Monoliths can use their skills.</li>



<li>Forsaken Miners now throw less grenades, which have also had their damage reduced and their visuals improved.</li>



<li>Rudja, the Dread Engineer’s grenades now deal less damage in Cruel and Maps.</li>



<li>Reduced how far away Faridun Plaguebringers can use their Detonate Dead skill from. The telegraphing for this skill has been improved.</li>



<li>Reduced how far away Lost-men Zealots can use their Meteor skill from. The visuals of this skill have also been improved.</li>



<li>The Lightning Storm skill used by Lost-men Zealots should now always strike at the telegraphed marker, as opposed to somewhere random.</li>



<li>Filthy Crone no longer uses their Projectile Vomit skill point blank in front of you (because that’s just rude), and now has a basic projectile attack.</li>



<li>Reduced the leap distance of Vile Vulture’s Leap skill. The visuals of this skill have also been improved.</li>



<li>Reduced the axe throwing distance of Vaal Axemen.</li>



<li>Reduced the area of effect for Filthy First-born’s on-death explosion. The visibility of the area of effect has also been improved.</li>



<li>The vomit skill used by Rotting Hulks and Bog Hulks now deal less damage, and can no longer be used point blank in front of you.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of The Bloated Miller’s slam skills to more closely match the visual effects.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of Zalmarath, the Colossus’ attacks to more closely match the visual effects.</li>



<li>Adjusted the player targeting behaviour for Zalmarath, the Colossus. Their arms are no longer targetable.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of Bahlak, the Sky Seer’s Tornadoes to more closely match the visual effects. Tornadoes now push you slightly away when they appear, and now deal less damage when they first appear before ramping up.</li>



<li>Reduced how often Prowling Shades can use their invisibility skill.</li>



<li>Adjusted the frequency of some monsters such as Prowling Shades and Gelid Zealots.</li>



<li>Vaal Zealots are now less likely to repeatedly use their Eye of Winter skill.</li>



<li>Improved the visual effects of Fiery Zealots’ Fire Storm skill.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of the Executioner’s attacks to more closely match the visual effects. The telegraphing for his Guillotine Slam has also been improved.</li>



<li>Improved the visibility of Cultists Archers’ skills. Their Toxic Rain skill also now deals less damage.</li>



<li>Jamanra, the Risen King’s zombie skirt no longer spontaneously explodes on death.</li>



<li>Mighty Silverfist’s Commando Roll skill now deals significantly less damage.</li>



<li>Reduced how often Azak Stalkers use their Slam skill.</li>



<li>Walking Goliaths no longer deal damage twice when they fall over. Their slam now deals more damage in the centre, and less around the edges.</li>



<li>Reduced the distance of which Urnwalkers in the Trial of the Sekhemas are able to initiate their skill. We’ve also fixed an issue where they were not dealing damage correctly, meaning they now deal more damage.</li>



<li>Slitherspitters no longer deal damage twice with their projectile attack. Their melee attack now deals Physical damage instead of Chaos.</li>



<li>The density of monsters in Utzaal has been reduced. Monsters contained in the area are now more likely to be of a weaker variety.</li>



<li>The density of monsters in Dreadnaught areas has been adjusted to result in less swarming encounters.</li>



<li>Improved the telegraphing for Azak Shamans’ Detonate Dead skill.</li>



<li>Improved the telegraphing for the crystals left by Vaal Goliaths when they die.</li>



<li>Chaos Pustules in Ritual encounters have had their visuals improved.</li>

            <p>Nintendo has reportedly set itself up with a supply chain network which will ultimately allow the company to sell in excess of 20m Switch 2 units during the console's first year on the market.</p>
<p>This nugget of information comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report citing Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu. To put that number into more perspective, Nintendo sold "around 15m" Switch units during its own first four quarters after release, so we are looking at (potentially) a 33 percent increase in sales during those first 12 months.</p>
<p>"Given the hardware segment drove 40 percent of fiscal 2024 top line, a successor to the 2017 Switch could go hand-in-hand with its stronger game pipeline in fiscal 2026, reversing what is expected to be the fourth consecutive year of lackluster sales growth in fiscal 2024," added analyst Nathan Naidu.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">announcement of the Switch 2</a> has been a long time coming. Over the last two or so years, we have been presented with leaks and reports from what felt like every corner of the internet bar Nintendo itself.</p>
<p>Now, however, the day has finally come for Nintendo's Switch successor to take the spotlight. Along with what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">appears to be mouse functionality for its Joy-Cons</a>, Nintendo also teased a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game coming to Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>We will hear more about Switch 2 in April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo hosts a Direct for the console</a>. As for when we will be able to get our hands on the hardware, it will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">available to play in London on April 11th to 13th</a>.</p>
<p>If it is still more Switch 2 you want, our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-pictures-switch-2-from-every-angle">Tom has broken down today's teaser so you can enjoy the console from every angle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In what has become fine tradition, I have learned of an amazing mod on the same day I have learned that the mod has been kiboshed by publishers. The mod in question is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-5-mod-recreating-gta-4s-map-nuked-after-6-years-of-work-because-people-noticed-and-rockstar-insisted-on-a-friendly-takedown-if-you-know-what-i-mean/">PCGamer</a>, team member NK Jellman broke the news on the project's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/worldtravel">Discord</a>. "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project," he wrote. "We appreciate all the support that the project has received, and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series."</p>

<p>This may seem a very cheerful way to announce that six years of work have been for naught, but Jellman insists World Travel have nothing but love for Our Friends At Rockstar, to say nothing of Their Friends At Parent Company Take-Two. "We've noticed a lot of misconceptions and theories surrounding our latest announcement and would like to make a few things clear," added NK Jellman in a later Discord post. "This isn't a DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim], rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and Rockstar Games / Take-Two Interactive." </p><p>Prior to its mutually agreed destruction, the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project brought back the entirety of GTA 4's warped New York complete with NPCs, the subway, the police forces, civilian traffic, car models, radio stations, and optional HD textures. All this for the low, low price of nothing at all.</p>
<p>Rockstar and Take-Two have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5-ai-mod-shot-down-by-take-two-even-as-rockstar-relax-policy-on-modding">track record</a>, of course, for bringing the hammer down on more ambitious GTA mods, though the criteria for a "friendly takedown" or worse remain ambiguous. This isn't the only <a href="https://fivemx.com/free/mlo/liberty-city/">GTA 5 Liberty City mod</a>. You could take it all as evidence that Rockstar are working on their own GTA 4 update, but according to reports <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-and-gta4-remasters-reportedly-scrapped-after-gta-trilogy-debacle">they shelved such plans in 2022</a> to focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The track is completely unfamiliar for one, but the karts themselves look totally different too, and seem to be in a sliiiiightly different style to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

They're cruising down a desert highway course we've never seen before complete with a Yoshi's Diner on the side of the course, NPC cars and trucks driving in the opposite direction, and an audience of cheering Toads. The karts themselves are also different from what we're used to in 8 Deluxe, and seem to be a little more compact and roundish, though it's hard to tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately we don't know much more about what this new Mario Kart is or how it plays.

Super Mario Odyssey was then later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-nintendo-switch">officially shown off just a few months later</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's likely we'll get more information on this new Mario Kart game during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct that was just announced for April 2, 2025.

            <p>Nintendo has finally lifted the lid on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> and... well, it looks an awful lot like the Switch. But there are subtle differences, a few obvious new additions, and still some intriguing questions about the new hardware to be answered.
</p>
<p>Let's take a tour of the console hardware, as seen in today's reveal video, for a closer look.
</p>
<p>The trailer begins with a look at the Switch's top and bottom ports (no laughing please) which notably will include an extra USB-C slot at the top of the console. Perhaps this is just so you have a further option for where to plug in your Switch 2 - maybe it docks both ways up, to save a bit of fiddling around there? Or, is this an attachment for something else, yet to be revealed? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Next up, a look at Switch 2's kick stand, which folds out from the rear of the console to allow you to play in tabletop mode. The kickstand has a new design and can support the Switch 2 from a much lower angle, all the way down to horizontal. Handy!</p>

Onto the Switch 2 Joy-Con, which have been given a fresh lick of paint. Gone are the old red and blue designs for Switch 1. These are slightly larger, to fit the larger Switch 2, and are now mostly black except for coloured side edges. As expected, the Joy-Con look to lock onto the main console unit via a magnetic connection, so there's no more fiddly rail to slide them into. Has Nintendo solved Joy-Con drift too? Let's hope so.

</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Nintendo-Switch-2-%E2%80%93-First-look-trailer-1-1-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The right Joy-Con, below, also features that mysterious extra button we saw from the console's leaks. It's been suggested this is referred to as the "C" button, though the final design has left the button blank - at least here. This is something we're likely to find out more about in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">April's big Nintendo Switch Direct event</a>.</p>

<p>Next is the mysterious Switch 2 optical sensor, seen at the top of the Joy-Con on the side it attaches to the main console. This sensor looks like it will enable a mouse-like control option for the console. </p>

<p>It's quick, but we can see an attachment being added to the edge of the Joy-Con to enable the controller to be held horizontal and shuffled around a surface like a wireless mouse.</p>

<p>The side of the Switch 2 where the Joy-Con attach is shown next, and looks much cleaner than on Switch 1 with its fiddly rail attachments.</p>

<p>A quick look at the Switch 2 dock shows it looking similar to that of the Switch 1, from the outside at least. We don't see inside of it, so there's no way of knowing how different it is. A previous report suggested it would not be compatible with the Switch 1, however.</p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our preview of the full <em>Soulbound</em> rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-soulbound-preview" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and our review of the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> core rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=8iJ-FJl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=gbnjrgGP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set comes with a load of content for the GM to create adventures beyond the introductory adenture.</figcaption></figure><h2>High Fantasy This Is Not</h2>

<p>Before we get into <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>, it's worth noting the difference between <em>Age of Sigmar (AoS),</em>&nbsp;and <em>Warhammer</em> (now known as <em>Warhammer the Old World</em> in Games Workshop's latest tabletop iteration). The original <em>Warhammer</em> was Games Workshop's fantasy wargaming system. In 2015 (a decade this year and we're still having this conversation) Games Workshop had a narrative event called the End Times, which ended the Old World and started the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> system, along with moving the narrative completely away and into a new fantasy setting (with many of the same elements, but also a lot of changes). Games Workshop has also since re-released (in January 2024) the <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> game, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I mention the above because Cubicle 7 publishes 2 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying systems. <em>Age of Sigmar Soubound</em>, for which we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Soulbound Starter Set here</em></a>, is set in Games Workshop's premier fantasy setting, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP),</em> which we are reviewing in this article, is set in Games Workshop's original fantasy system. <em>WFRP</em> also persevered throughout the removal of <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> from Games Workshop's wargaming range throughout the 2015-2024 gap.</p>

<p>We'll go into details of both settings in our coverage of the systems, but a quick summary is that <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> is set in a more traditional fantasy setting, with the races of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and Skaven (ratmen) all battling over the map of the Old World, and&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> sees the different races fighting across 8 different Mortal Realms, 8 unique planes of existence, connected through realm gates. A lot of the classic races are included, but they have a unique Games Workshop twist in <em>AoS</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=cZ2-Vr3C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=9ZBh7fBV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The players get quick reference cards for the rules they need, along with maps of the city and area, and handouts while they go through the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>True Dwarven Craftsmanship</h2>

<p>Most roleplaying products start with a single book, either a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow">Core Rulebook</a>, which contains everything players and Games Masters (GM) need to run the games,&nbsp;or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Players Handbook</a>, which focuses on the core mechanics and player options, expanding into other books for the Games Master&nbsp;(which we see historically in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> by Wizards of the Coast). <i>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&nbsp;</i>has a Core Rulebook available, but also to make it even easier, the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set has everything 6 players, plus a GM need to play their first few games in one easy package, with no printing or other products required.</p>

<p>The <em>WFRP</em> starter set box includes a whole raft of contents, including 6 pre-generated fold-out character sheets, handouts, rules references for the players, and 2 10-sided dice. The <em>WFRP</em> system uses a percentile system, for which players roll both dice, one for the tens and one for the units, to get a roll between 01 and 100.</p>

<p>For the GM, the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set begins with the Adventure Book, and the adventure Making the Rounds, which leads both the players and the GM through their first game. Making the Rounds can be spread across several gaming sessions if the GM wishes. Alongside the core story, the Adventure Book also includes 10 additional scenarios that can be used throughout the adventure, or as separate tie-in adventures later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The GM will need to read through the entire Adventure Book, in order to understand the rules and the adventure's story to best guide the players through, but this is usually the case for Games Masters, who do all the preparation in advance of gaming sessions. The starter set adventure book guides you through the system, giving you tips on how to GM, and acts as a tutorial for the rules as the players progress.</p>

<p>The first edition of <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> had players' initial characters at an extremely low level. They were capable humans, but not the heroic heroes that we find in A<em>ge of Sigmar. </em>In contrast, the 6 pre-generated characters in the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> starter set feel more heroic than first edition WFRP characters did, but not as heroic as Soulbound characters (especially not the immortal Stormcast Eternal who are reforged and reborn when they die).</p>

<p>The starter set characters give a fantastic view of those available in WFRP, whilst still being accessible to those not familiar with the setting. There's a noble soldier, a dwarf slayer (think shirtless barbarian berzerker), a halfling thief, a scythe-wielding wizard, an elf merchant (an incredible addition as a less combat-focused character,&nbsp; but still an elf, so still capable), and the classic WFRP Witch Hunter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=JAuv5voQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=XsI8NRl9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>WFRP</em> uses a percentile dice system, 2D10 to get a number between 1 and 100, and the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set comes with a custom set.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are The Chances!</h2>

<p><em>WRFP</em> uses a percentile system, the same as the original <em>WFRP</em> system, which gives it a more classical feel that suits the setting. This system requires players to roll 2D10, to get a number between 1 and 100, needing to score under their skill to succeed. The GM can add or subtract to the character's skill, depending on how hard to test is. There's also the option to have a dramatic test, where the amount under the tens number demonstrates how successful the test is (a roll of 10 against a test of 70 would be 6 dramatic successes for example).</p>

<p>The Starter Set keeps the level of detail light and accessible, with wounds and critical wounds, but leaves out the full level of detail on&nbsp;injuries, disease, corruption, and psychology that the full rulebook has. This is probably a good choice for keeping the rules straightforward, the product is aimed at new roleplayers and GMs, but it does leave out one of <em>WFRP</em>'s most interesting elements in the realism that it has over more heroic systems.</p>

<p>That doesn't take away from how good the starter set is, as a product, the adventure, and how well it introduces players to the gloriously dark <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> setting.</p>

<h2>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set </em>is a fantastic product. The components are thematic, immersive, and high-quality. The adventure it contains introduces players well to the setting and the system and can be expanded into several full sessions with the hooks in the adventure book, and the detail included in the Ubersreik Guide. Brand new GMs will have to do some work preparing for the adventure, but the adventure book does give you a lot of tips for running the game. But most importantly, everyone will have a blast playing through the adventure, which is full of character.</p>

            <p>The world looked upon the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and saw that it was good. Or is it? Observe its enlarged, bezel-shaved screen. Its all-black colour scheme. Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the <em>real</em> best gaming handheld of 2025, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, that one’s better.</p>

<h3>1. The Switch 2’s shoulder triggers don’t travel as far</h3>
<p>Look at that tiny clearance betwixt button and chassis. Sir, your travel depth is as shallow as your knowledge of ergonomics.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Steam-Deck-shoulder-buttons.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>Now behold the vast, deep-pressing girth of the Steam Deck triggers – you could land a plane on that, and not just because I’ve massively zoomed in the photo.</p>

<h3>2. The Switch 2 still uses convex thumbsticks, ignoring current thumb shape trends</h3>
<p>I know over twenty people and none of them have a single thumb, let alone two, that curves inwards at the tip. As such, the Switch 2’s thumbsticks make no sense, unlike the concave sticks of the Steam Deck that will nestle your digits like a kitten in a fruit bowl.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Nintendo-Switch-2-vents.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<h3>3. The Switch 2 vents are smaller so you can’t huff as much vent-smell</h3>
<p>I don’t care <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-huffing-your-steam-deck-vent-fumes-valve-plead-as-players-obsess-over-new-deck-smell">what Valve says</a>, this is my right as a consumer. Are you going to let Nintendo take away your rights?</p>

<h3>4. The Switch 2 controllers can’t transform into gaming mice</h3>
<p>This is actually a feature of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, rather than the Steam Deck. But the Steam Deck is a better handheld than the Legion Go, and since the Switch 2’s lack of improvised mouse sensors make it worse than the Legion Go, that means it’s also worse than the Steam Deck.</p>

<h3>5. The Switch 2 runs Mario Kart and I hate Mario Kart because my friend Nathan always beats me at it</h3>
<p>Why should the best driver be determined by the contents of magic boxes, it’s a stupid game</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
