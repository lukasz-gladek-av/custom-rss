            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Gamesfray</a> spotted that as of last week, Nintendo had secured <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">US Patent 12,403,397</a>, a patent that protects the game mechanic of "<em>causing a sub-character to appear</em>," or in other words, summoning a character, and "<em>controlling a battle between the sub-character and the enemy character</em>." Which is a long way of describing a classic Pokémon battle. You could also call it another patent in Nintendo's arsenal in its legal battle against <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/">Palworld maker, PocketPair</a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the only patent that Nintendo has acquired, as it also secured <a href="https://archive.org/details/12409387">US Patent 12,409,387</a>, which protects mechanics around player characters riding other in-game "<em>objects</em>," which is another patent that fits right in its fight against PocketPair and Palworld.</p>



<p>No matter who is doing it, whether it's Nintendo, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros.</a>, or any other entity, it's never great to see videogame companies patent game mechanics. But according to IP and patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, these latest patents go beyond the general level of ire that patenting game mechanics causes players. Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/an-embarrassing-failure-of-the-us-patent-system-videogame-ip-lawyer-says-nintendos-latest-patents-on-pokemon-mechanics-should-not-have-happened-full-stop/">PC Gamer</a>, Sigmon doesn't mince words, saying, "<em>Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents</em>. <em>They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system</em>."</p>



<p>For Sigmon, it's not just the content of the patents and what they protect, it's how little of a fight the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) put up against Nintendo when it came to questioning and scrutinizing these patents. </p>



<p>"<em>This seems like a situation where the USPTO essentially gave up and just allowed the case, assuming that the claims were narrow or specific enough to be new without evaluating them too closely</em>. <em>I strongly disagree with this result: In my view, these claims were in no way allowable</em>...<em>This allowance should not have happened, full stop.</em>"</p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>An obvious issue with these patents that Sigmon also points out is that they don't just apply to Nintendo's fight with PocketPair. They can apply to scores of other games, and give large companies with deep legal departments too much power to threaten whoever they want whenever they see fit. For Sigmon, it's a warping of the patent system that he still believes in.</p>



<p>"<em>The USPTO dropped the ball big time, and it's going to externalize a lot of uncertainty (and, potentially, litigation cost) onto developers and companies that do not deserve it</em>...<em>They were not made to allow a big player to game the system, get an overly broad patent that they should have never received in the first place, and then go around bullying would-be competition with the threat of a legally questionable lawsuit.</em>"</p>



<p>Securing patents that it could turn around and claim PocketPair is infringing on is right in-line with the 'hail mary' tactics Nintendo has been trying with its lawsuit against PocketPair and Palworld. This past July, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">reports surfaced of Nintendo adjusting existing patents</a> to better align with its arguments against PocketPair.</p>



<p>As Sigmon points out, the most terrifying aspect of these patents is the precedent they set. It could be that these patents are rolled back if an Inter Partes Review case is successfully heard. But with how easily these patents went through, it doesn't seem worth it to put stock in the USPTO going through patents like this with a fine-tooth comb.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-multiplayer-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/future-far-cry-games-will-focus-much-more-on-multiplayer-ubisoft-says.1294746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has revealed that future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will likely have much more of a multiplayer focus, and he says the shift is to ensure longevity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-will-more-predominantly-push-multiplayer-in-future/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Guillemot spoke about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series during the New Global Sport Conference in Saudi Arabia, at which he was asked about what was next for the first-person shooter franchise.</p>

<p>In response to that question, Guillemot said that the goal for the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series is to "bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed" so that the franchise and its games "can also be played for a long time by players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=H7i_L6Oq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=46PqyLwy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will foreground multiplayer to a much greater degree.</figcaption></figure><p>According to VGC, Guillemot's comments echo rumors that&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>is being developed in conjunction with a standalone multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>game, which the publication says will be an "extraction-based shooter set in the Alaskan wilderness".</p>

<p>The last game in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-6-release-date-revealed-for-late-2021" rel="nofollow">launched almost four years ago</a>. Ubisoft hasn't announced exact sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, but in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/7FRH9Pjch7t9yXb4GMFgi0/db479fa1ae07fc5264f8b16e1d7a15f8/Ubisoft_FY22_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021-22 financial report</a>, the studio claimed the game was behind the series' "best year ever".</p>

<p>Of course, given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">recent</a> financial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">woes</a>, it stands to reason that the company would want to shore up sales for its major brands as much as possible, but whether shifting to multiplayer will work that magic for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>franchise has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, but in December last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rumors suggested</a> that the game had been internally pushed from a 2025 release window to 2026, so it may be some time before we hear from the series again.</p>




<p>If Guillemot's comments are to be believed, then it's likely that when&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>does arrive, it'll push its multiplayer aspect much more prominently, so you might want to grab a friend or two to play it with. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now. Our Borderlands 4 review is not, because we have only just been sent a review code. I fear I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">unduly forgiving of Team Cherry</a> last week for not supplying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> code before release - they're a cute, tiny indie, after all, albeit a cute, tiny indie with the power to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-has-murdered-steam">break Steam</a> - so let's take a firmer stance this time: bad! Wrong! Don't you know you're suffocating games journalism, Gearbox and 2K Games, you swaggering chancers? Whither accountability and transparency in a time of choosy PR departments? 
</p>
<p>I should teach you all a lesson by diverting your brand power and googlejuice towards some other game instead. I think I will, actually. What else is on sale today. Ah yes, Try To Drive.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Try To Drive (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621700/Try_To_Drive/">Steam page</a>) is one of those daft multiplayer games that trades on co-op partners repeatedly sabotaging each other. In this case, it's a tandem simulator, a tandem being a bicycle for two people.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Red Core Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Doesn't sound nearly as arduous upfront as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">climbing out of hell</a> while shackled to Nic "We Can Jump Those Lasers" Reuben and Brendan "My Left Not Your Left" Caldwell, but you will not be cycling down any ordinary roads in Try To Drive. You will be cycling along chains of floating biscuits pooped out by gingerbread men. You will be ponderously T-bogging your way over precarious glass accordions.
</p><p>I actually have some firsthand expertise to bring to bear, here, based on sharing a tandem with my life partner. The trick is to put the one with the biggest bum in front. No, I am not going to tell you whether I have a bigger bum than my partner - don't be uncouth. My other top tip is to put a mirror on your handlebar so you can check whether the other rider is goofing off.
</p>
<p>I have run out of tandem expertise to share, so let's circle grudgingly back to Borderlands 4, the game that murdered journalism. My big takeaway from the previewage so far is that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-wont-be-making-jokes-every-minute-because-its-set-in-a-totalitarian-world">won't be as jokey as the other Borderlands games</a>, apparently because it's set in a totalitarian world, and they want to set a grimmer tone. 
</p>
<p>As some of you noted at the time of that linked report, the idea that humour isn't seemly in this context seems absurd, given that past Borderlands games have already seen us battling against odious corporate bosses and tyrants, while rattling through gags like ammo belts. That said, I do think Borderlands in general could benefit from being less punchline-driven.
</p>
<p>Beyond that, I can tell you only that they want <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-cutting-the-gags-borderlands-4s-pc-specs-say-it-still-needs-100gb-of-ssd-space">100GB</a> of SSD space for the pleasure, and they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">pondering an $80 price tag</a> at one point. If you're hungry for more, I will grit my teeth and suggest that you cast your eye over <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/borderlands-4-review/">this review from Very Gary Computing</a>. They <em>did</em> get code, possibly because they didn't call the studio boss an idiot in any of their news coverage.
</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

              <p>The streaming wars are over and with them the era of cheap, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">buffet-style content delivery systems</a> is coming to an end. Prices are getting jacked up. Subscribers are getting nickel-and-dimed. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav is here to promise you that HBO Max will be doing this too.</p> <p>“We haven’t been pushing on the password sharing and the economics yet,” the cosmic-brained exec told other rich people at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology conference this week, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/why-hbo-max-password-sharing-crackdown-1236514152/">per <em>Variety</em></a>. “People are really starting to love HBO Max. That’s the key. We want them to fall in love with our content, with our series, with the differentiated offering outside the U.S. and then over time, it’s a little tricky, with the password sharing, we’re going to begin to push on that.”</p> <p>You can tell Zaslav loves his job because he talks about locating the optimal pricing strategy for other people’s creative output like he’s searching for the G-spot on a P&amp;L spreadsheet. Warner Bros. announced last month that it would soon start aggressively monitoring HBO subscribers’ accounts to make sure they weren’t letting friends and family mooch off them. But the password sharing crackdown isn’t the only thing coming to the home of <em>The Last Of Us</em> and<em> Peacemaker</em>.</p>

 <p>He continued, “I think our ability to raise price as people become more and more in love with the quality that we have and the series that we have and the offering that we have will have a real ability because I think the pricing across the board—not only is there too many players, in order to stay alive, a lot of the players have just decided to drop prices aggressively.”</p> <p>HBO Max’s first major price hike came in 2023 when the main plan <a href="https://www.avclub.com/hbo-max-subscription-price-increase-1849980303">went from&nbsp;$15 to $16 a month</a>. The following year prices went up again as the plans splintered, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/max-price-increase-hike-1236024561/">with the Ultimate tier rising to $21 a month</a>. HBO became HBO Max in 2020, then just Max in 2023, and then went back to HBO Max earlier this year. During that same period Zaslav saw the disastrous merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery that led to tons of debt and massive gutting of content at, among other places, HBO. Now Warner Bros. and Discovery will split up again by April 2026 as the stock price hovers below $20, down from a peak in 2021 of over $70.</p>

 <p>Big “my job here is done” energy from the guy awarded $50 million last year in total compensation for shuffling logos around on a whiteboard. Except we now know his job won’t truly be done until he jacks up HBO prices a few more times. Next year sees the arrival of a new <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off,<em> A</em> <em>Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>, and the <em>Green Lantern</em> detective show, followed by the <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot in 2027.</p> <p>“I think we want a good deal for consumers,” Zaslav said this week, “but I think over time, there’s real opportunity, particularly for us, in that quality area, to raise price.”</p>

            <p>Françoise Cadol, the actor who voiced the French version of Lara Croft in all of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> from their inception to 2008, is taking legal action against Aspyr Media for the apparent AI-generated use of her voice in the Tomb Raider 4-6 remasters.</p>
<p>Cadol told <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/cinema/cest-une-trahison-quand-lia-vole-la-voix-francaise-dangelina-jolie-pour-tomb-raider-10-09-2025-63HIGMNMEZBSFLELCKNN4S5I2M.php">French newspaper Le Parisien</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-ai-voice-generation-france-francoise-cadol-cease-and-desist/">The Gamer</a>) that Aspyr Media generated lines of dialogue using her voice without asking her or even notifying her. She has reportedly issued Aspyr a cease and desist demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BastienDruker/status/1956361274515743015">Examples of the allegedly AI-generated voice lines</a> were shared on social media, and in them you can clearly hear the difference between the original Tomb Raider games and the recently remastered ones. A much more robotic reading of the lines suddenly takes over part-way through the remastered dialogue.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>🇫🇷 ALERTE INFO — Le patch des remasters de Tomb Raider IV, V et VI par <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AspyrMedia</a> vient de sortir…</p><p>Mauvaise surprise pour les fans français de Lara Croft, certaines répliques de Françoise Cadol dans le tutoriel ont été refaites avec l’IA et ça s’entend ! <a href="https://t.co/YRbZsY669H">pic.twitter.com/YRbZsY669H</a></p></div>— Bastien D.

<p>Cadol, who has regularly dubbed for high-profile actors like Angelina Jolie, including dubbing her performance in the 2001 Tomb Raider film, was alerted to the recording discrepancies by French Tomb Raider fans. Speaking to Le Parisien, Cadol said the use of AI here was a "betrayal" of their support.</p><p>"It's a game, my voice accompanies the gamers, we play together," Cadol said in a translation of the article. "Tomb Raider has been followed by a lot of people over the years, for them, it's a betrayal, a total disrespect. They are angry."</p>
<p>Alarmingly, this isn't the only example of AI-generated voice work in the game. Brazilian actor Lene Bastos was also told by fans that her voice seemed to have been AI-generated in the remasters, and she decided to speak out about it. This prompted a reply - and apology - from Aspyr. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMNDrFj8R9/?hl=en-gb">Bastos explains in an Instagram video</a> that Aspyr promised to remove the AI-generated lines in an update in a few weeks.</p>
<p>It's unclear if Aspyr has contacted Cadol and said the same. We've requested comment from Aspyr.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-entire-french-cast-of-voice-actors-risk-jobs-in-ai-dispute">the entire French cast of multiplayer shooter Apex Legends refused to sign an agreement allowing their voices to train generative AI</a> for the game.</p>
<p>"We are asked to give up our expertise to train the generative AI that will replace us tomorrow," commented Pascale Chemin at the time, the French voice of Wraith in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. "We are asked to agree to what we specifically fight against. We are asked to shoot ourselves in the foot. We are asked to support AI."</p>

<p>Don't get your Robotniks in a twist</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega has dropped some details regarding the demo for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>As you'll no doubt already be aware, a demo for the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/sonic-racing-crossworlds-scores-free-single-player-demo-this-month">confirmed a little while back</a>, and we have also had a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-for-switch-is-now-live">stress test available to try out</a> for a little bit. Now, though, starting on the dates compiled below, the game's official demo will be available to play for Switch 1 owners:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 9pm (Tue) PDT / 10pm (Tue) MDT / 11pm (Tue) CDT / 12am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 5am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 6am CEST / 7am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 1pm JST / 12pm AWST / 2pm AEST</li></ul>


<p>Not too long to go now until we get a proper shot at what looks like a game which could give the ever-dominant Mario a run for his money on the karting front. Maybe. So long as it runs ok! We'll find out on 25th September.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 version of the game is still set for a "holiday 2025" digital release date (physical fans gotta hold out until early 2026), so stay tuned to Nintendo Life for exact dates when they drop.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Will you be jumping into the demo for Sonic Racing: Crossworlds next week? Played the stress test and have any impressions? Make sure to let us know!</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-getting-an-exact-amount-v-bucks-option-next-month.1294707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that you'll soon be able to buy exact amounts of V-Bucks in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, so if you want something that's 500 V-Bucks but you've only got 400, you won't need to buy hundreds more to make up the difference.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-v-bucks-exact-amount-purchasing-offer-in-fortnite?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, Epic confirms that this feature is coming on October 14th, and that it'll be available not only in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but also in&nbsp;<em>Rocket League&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Fall Guys&nbsp;</i>as well.</p>

<p>There's a catch, though: you won't be able to take advantage of this feature on PlayStation. It'll be available on every other platform, though, so presumably, thanks to the wonders of cross-progression, you can just play somewhere else, top up your account, then head back to PlayStation to enjoy your spoils.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount-window.jpg?itok=doI5o5o0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount-window.jpg?itok=11tTQtza 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is getting an Exact Amount button for V-Bucks purchases.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also take advantage of the new Exact Amount offer on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>web shop, so even if you don't have another platform to hand, you can grab your V-Bucks there if you'd prefer to top up with just what you need.</p>

<p>Although the PlayStation limitation will be frustrating for those playing on that platform, Epic says it'll "work to make [the new feature] available everywhere", so you may see the option appearing on PlayStation in future as well.</p>

<p>Exact Amount offers will be available "in increments of 50" for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>'s in-game currencies, while in&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, increments of 100 will be available, with balances being rounded up to the nearest 100. Epic says this is being done in order to "align with item prices".</p>

<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>feature follows the revelation back in July that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma" rel="nofollow">may never return to iOS in the UK</a> thanks to decisions made by the country's CMA regulatory body, although the game did make its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">triumphant return to the US App Store back in May</a>.</p>

<p>You can do that, and a lot more besides, in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now on...well, on pretty much every platform going, although you may want to avoid PlayStation if you're looking to use the new Exact Amount feature.</p>

              <p><span>As </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span> once more raises the ugly discourse over gaming difficulty, there’s one aspect of the whole discussion that I think goes missed by people on every side: people play games for different reasons. It sounds stinkingly obvious, but there’s a nuance to this that I think is best summed up by believing or disbelieving the following statement: It’s fine if someone can’t complete a game.</span></p> <p><span>Video games began being about insurmountable difficulty as players chased high scores, knowing all the while that the only ending in store for them was a GAME OVER screen. At the same time, video games began being about telling a story, guiding a player through a narrative or series of lands and levels to reach its conclusion. Whether in the arcades or via text adventures on the home computers, gaming was born with this dichotomy, and as things have become increasingly more complicated, it’s never gone away. In recent years, as genres increasingly twist and meld, the distinctions between “types” of games have become effectively meaningless, leaving no clear distinction between those two sides. Right now, in this era so dominated by soulslikes and roguelites, this schism has never been more pronounced.</span></p> <p><span>My bias, to state it from the start, is that it feels </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> fine if someone cannot complete a game. I work with people whom I deeply respect who strongly believe and cogently argue the opposite.&nbsp; And to be absolutely clear, I’m not here to say that one is right and one is wrong, simply because that isn’t true. It’s a matter of contention, with arguments for either side, and perhaps the only reason it feels like it </span><i><span>needs</span></i><span> to be resolved is because a person’s approach can feel incredibly important to them.</span></p>

 <h2>No one is right, everyone is right</h2> <p><span>Let’s repeat that once more: no side is </span><i><span>right</span></i><span>, and context is everything. But the point here is: that context is deeply ambiguous and confusing, and no one has a firm grip on it. Hence the issues.</span></p> <p><span>At one point, in a very large part, video games were about high scores. You couldn’t beat the game, you weren’t intended to finish it, but rather the goal was to see if you could get further than last time, or beyond the point your friends can reach. That design model was in large part due to how those video games were monetized; you were paying by the dime, or by the quarter, and the more coins you put in the machine, the more money the game made. If it were easy, if it were designed such that you should be able to win, then it would be a disaster.</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, on university machines and eventually home computers, other games were being built around text. While MUDs (multi-user dungeons) complicated the nuance far too early in the whole history, let’s instead focus on single-player games. These were, around the same era as the rise of the arcades, text adventures. Games about experiencing a story with a direct sense of involvement. You chose whether to go North or South, picked up the rope and then used it on the well, and hit the goblin with your sword. While you were working through a prescribed route, the experience was your own simply because you’d executed the actions. You may have died because you forgot to tie the rope to the well, or been hit harder by that goblin, and then had to try again, but the game’s ultimate purpose was for you to reach its ending.</span></p> <p><span>So from the very beginning, there were these two diametrically opposed intentions. One half of games relied on your never being able to finish them, the other relied on your being able to do so.</span></p>

 <p><span>Obviously things immediately became more complicated. Arcade games were released on home computers, games became far more complex, sandbox games soon sprang up which were neither about trying to kill you nor guiding you to a conclusion, and eventually multiplayer gaming turned everything into an infinite loop. Throughout all this, games were released with the specific intention of never letting you finish, or wanting you to finish, and people mostly understood which were which. And, for a while, the majority seemed to be the latter. Even a 100-hour role-playing game or a gore-laden first-person shooter were deliberately created with the intention that people who bought the games would be able to finish the games. For the most part, the tougher games of this nature came with difficulty settings so anyone for whom the challenge was too great could turn it down and still see that ending. (And indeed those finding it too easy could make it a more pleasingly tough challenge.) This all began right as the heyday of&nbsp; what were always loosely called “arcade games” began to fade. Games that were still intended to be close to impossible for most people to finish, still all about that high score, or those supremely difficult 2D action games that were so hard that most people could only see the earliest levels. Your </span><i><span>Ninja Gaiden</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Contra</span></i><span> games, utterly beloved by those who went into games wanting a brutal challenge, and bemusing to those who arrived without forewarning.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000624620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624620"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624620">© Tecmo / Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>A platform for complaints</h2> <p><span>This is the next stage of this schism. There are those who see games like an increasingly steep mountain to climb, with seemingly impossible vertical stretches down which they keep sliding, again and again, until after days of practice and failure they finally ascend. And there are those who cannot imagine anything worse than replaying the same bit of a game 20 times, failing each time, never sure if they’re going to be able to get past it. And neither seems to be able to comprehend the mentality of the other.</span></p>

 <p><span>And that’s completely understandable! Because as we’ve established, people have been raised on games to believe each exact opposite position is the way in which games are intended to be played. And if there’s one genre of games where this is more confusing than any other, it’s platform games.</span></p> <p><span>Again, twas always thus. I remember these games I’d play as a kid that seemed deliberately ludicrous, games in which I’d play the first three levels over and over and over, never even knowing if anything even came after them, so frequently would I die. </span><i><span>Jet Set Willy</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Chuckie Egg 2</span></i><span> stand out as examples of platform games that seemed to be designed to be close to impossible from their opening moments (though I was also like eight years old). Even the original </span><i><span>Super Mario Bros.</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span> games weren’t designed to be won in a sitting, with limited lives and the lack of a means to save meaning you would endlessly start again from scratch, trying to reach further than the last time. Most often, this difficulty was a result of technological limitations. It simply wasn’t possible to save your game, so a game that’s really only a handful of hours long could last you forever if it were hard enough. But the moment saving became a thing, tellingly a huge number of games started to be designed with progress as a core element.</span></p>

 <p><span>Nearly every </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span> game in the last three decades has been created with the player being able to finish as part of its design. Metroidvanias like </span><i><span>Ori and the Blind Forest</span></i><span> have been created so that almost every player can see them through, with difficulty settings that allow players to shape the experience for themselves. Others, like more recent </span><i><span>Metroid</span></i><span> games, remain incredibly difficult in their later stages, especially with boss fight spikes, but they’re still not intended to prevent most people who buy them from being able to roll the credits. It became increasingly normal for platform games to be designed this way.</span></p> <h2>A large number of likes</h2> <p><span>Meanwhile, two other significant genres arose. There was the “roguelite” (“roguelike” is used too, but it conflates things with, well, games like </span><i><span>Rogue</span></i><span> which are something else entirely), where the idea of the game was to see how far you could get with a specific build (be it character, deck of cards, or choice of tools), then losing everything (or almost everything) when you made a mistake. It became normal again for games to be designed to be unbeatable at first, requiring repeated play to improve. However, the crucial difference was that each attempt would play out differently, with procedurally generated levels, or randomized scenarios, and different equipment allowing different approaches. And also, </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> happened, and it changed </span><i><span>everything</span></i><span>. For those who played games for the challenge, who wanted to be beaten up over and over, suddenly the dial started swinging in their direction again. Huge numbers of similar games appeared, and as the “soulslike” became an established term, it started to diffuse into other genres.</span></p>

 <p><span>In 2016, </span><i><span>Salt &amp; Sanctuary</span></i><span> opened the door, through which 2017’s </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> and 2019’s </span><i><span>Blasphemous </span></i><span>followed at which point everything became so god damned confusing. Because now we had these pixel platformers, or even super-cute cartoon games, that were nightmarishly difficult to play, doubling down with a lack of difficulty options. And audiences were understandably not able to know which way a particular game was heading.</span></p> <p><span>In the midst of these developments in the 2010s rose the monstrosity of the “git gud” culture. But, and I’m typing through gritted teeth, there </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> a valid argument beneath the grim unpleasantness. Because, to return us to the thesis of this meandering piece, there is a vast audience of people who play games because they want to struggle, to fight against the wall, and to gradually get better until they can conquer the challenge. So, when someone else comes along and says the </span><i><span>incredibly reasonable</span></i><span> statement, “I’ve been loving this game for the last five hours, but now I can’t play any more because it’s become impossibly difficult,” it makes sense to one entire contingent of players to say, “You need to get better.” Because they’re right. You </span><i><span>do</span></i><span> need to get better if you want to get past that point.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, and I feel like a marriage counselor trying to explain how one partner’s comments are heard entirely differently by the other, it’s the most abysmally unhelpful and unsatisfying answer to the contingent of players who weren’t ever playing the game for a grueling challenge, but for an entirely different reason. They were playing for the continual satisfaction of progress, to keep experiencing the thing they are enjoying in new and refreshing ways. They don’t want to personally improve their dexterity levels to be able to perform lightning reflexes across seventeen buttons to get past this one enemy, but just get past this one enemy. Their goals, their intentions, their very reason for playing the game in the first place was utterly different, and until that point it was being met. So being told, “Be better at the game then,” is not only unhelpful, but wholly irrelevant.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the player who just wants to sit back and calmly play is equally incomprehensible to the challenge-seeker. Why on Earth do you want to play this game if you’re not even interested in improving? This game was designed so you would learn through trial, where hitting the wall is about learning to punch it harder until you break through. It’s </span><i><span>the whole point of the game</span></i><span>, and declaring that there should be a way to make it easier is entirely missing the point. Being told, “But I just want to carry on playing,” is not only unhelpful, but wholly irrelevant.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s quite the impasse.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000624621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624621">© Capcom / Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>It’s fair that people are confused</h2> <p><span>This, in a very gap-riddled, convoluted way, brings us to today, and 2025’s breakout hit, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>. Because when a game gets this big, sells this well, and is receiving this kind of word-of-mouth, it is of course going to attract audiences from every approach. Not only is </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> a colossal success on Steam (it’s been regularly seeing half a million concurrent players every day since launch, which is almost unheard of for a single-player game), but it’s also arrived day-one on Game Pass, meaning millions of Xbox owners will have been able to install it for no extra cost. And when a game looks as gorgeous as </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> in its screenshots and videos, why wouldn’t you?</span></p> <p><span>I say all this to address the rather silly claim that “everyone should know how hard it is” because of 2017’s </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. Bit of perspective on that: 2017 was eight years ago. So yeah, there are adults today who were in elementary school when that game came out, and it’s wild to believe everyone encountering the buzz for the game should have filled in the history. Secondly, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> absolutely doesn’t present itself as a crazy-hard game. Firstly, its characters are lovely-looking insects with stunning animation, which immediately implies something gentle. Then, the game’s store description isn’t explicit about the challenge.</span></p>

 <p><span>“As the lethal hunter Hornet, adventure through a kingdom ruled by silk and song! Captured and taken to this unfamiliar world, prepare to battle mighty foes and solve ancient mysteries as you ascend on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak.</span></p> <p><span>“Hollow Knight: Silksong is the epic sequel to Hollow Knight, the award winning action-adventure. Journey to all-new lands, discover new powers, battle vast hordes of bugs and beasts and uncover secrets tied to your nature and your past.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“a deadly pilgrimage” is doing a lot of work in that sentence once you know, but doesn’t exactly give the game away.</span></p> <p><span>So </span><i><span>of course</span></i><span> people not expecting to meet with astonishingly difficult boss fights are arriving on the game’s doorstep. People who are just flabbergasted that, say, a metroidvania would so facetiously make a core feature—the map—be locked behind multiple purchases and even then be hugely obfuscated. Who does that?! What is going on?! When will this game be fixed so it works sensibly?!</span></p>

 <h2>Life of the Author</h2> <p><span>What none of this addresses is the most divisive aspect of all this topic: developer intent. </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span> has been developed this way by Team Cherry </span><i><span>on purpose</span></i><span>. It is meant to be incredibly difficult, forcing players to try again and again and again to traverse its trickiest sections, and to take dozens of attempts to defeat its toughest bosses. Of course it is! You wouldn’t play </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> and demand the boss fights be easier, right? Only</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231"> <span>a depraved pervert would think such a thing</span></a><span>. The developer’s intention demands that this game not have difficulty options, and it would defeat the point of how and why it was made for that to change. Surely it’s ridiculous to even want to play a game in a way it wasn’t created to be played?</span></p> <p><span>Here I have to get personal. As an avowed Barthesian, I think this is gibberish, and I absolutely, fundamentally am not interested in “developer intent” once the semiotics are in my own hands. (To be very, very clear, I am absolutely fascinated by developer intent, and love to hear about it, speak to developers about it, and think the topic is wonderful. I just don’t see why it should also control my personal life.) I double down on this when I’ve paid money to get access to the game. It seems </span><i><span>wild</span></i><span> to me that after I’ve bought and installed it’s anyone else’s business how I go about playing this offline single-player game. I absolutely get that if I were able to lower the difficulty (and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksongs-most-popular-mods-make-it-easier-too-hard-boss-fights-2000624107"> <span>vast numbers of people already are</span></a><span>) that I wouldn’t be experiencing the game as the developers intended. I also don’t mind about that one bit if it means I can </span><i><span>experience the game at all</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>I think it’s this distinction that causes the most consternation. “</span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span> is meant to be played this way” versus “</span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span> is meant to be played at all.”</span></p> <p><span>Is there a middle ground? Of course, vast expanses of it. It’s just that most of us don’t want to agree to sit in it, myself included. But how about this?</span></p> <ol> <li aria-level="1"><span>Team Cherry has built </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> to be played in one particular way, and worked phenomenally hard to craft that experience exactly as intended. Untold skill has gone into creating it, and creating it in this specific form. And that’s worthy of enormous respect. The creators are under no obligations whatsoever to change the game, and should not have to respond to public demand whether it’s to add difficulty options or make it even harder. It’s how Team Cherry wants it to be.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>This game is of such enormous popularity that it very understandably has picked up a very large audience of people who are not skillful enough, or don’t desire to become skillful enough, to be able to play the game as is designed, and feel frustrated that they’ve spent money on game they’re unable to play.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Those people have every right to adjust the game’s difficulty by mods or any other method such that they can enjoy it in the way they want to.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Other people are allowed to believe those people have ruined the game for themselves, and if they would only have persisted with the challenge they would have grown to understand why it was made the way it was.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>These two groups of people aren’t going to understand the other, and that’s fine. There are bigger things to worry about.</span></li> </ol> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>There are bigger things to worry about.</p>

<p>Improvements to vehicles, photo mode, and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0650ed79dac82/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure><p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">has released</a> yet another patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on Switch 2, introducing a number of fixes and improvements to vehicles, photo mode, quests, the open world, and more.</p>
<p>One of the key improvements is the implementation of AutoDrive, which would previously be a bit hit and miss – quite literally. It seems this has now been smoothed out, allowing vehicles to avoid obstacles a bit better and make navigation generally a bit more pleasant.</p>
<p>It's kind of remarkable to see the team at CDPR continue to apply improvements to Cyberpunk five years after its initial release. Yes, the game was a bit of a mess at launch, but it's since been moulded into what might be one of the best open world games of all time. Heck, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG9Hn3aT7jo">our lovely video producer Alex thinks so</a>, anyway!</p>
<p>So let's check out the full patch notes...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated AutoDrive. When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Johnny always spawned in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applying CrystalCoat to the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru caused its wheels to flash in different colors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Photo Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the new poses introduced in Update 2.3 now work with any gender.</li>
<li>Disabled NPC collision, which will make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision (e.g. on car hoods).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some of the poses didn't work for Royce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freedom</em> - Fixed the journal entry that appears when the player chooses not to steal the Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred."</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath</em> - Fixed an issue where, after V fails to pursue and stop Semimaru and receives a text from River saying he'll contact V soon, the follow-up message never arrives.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath -</em> Fixed an issue where the Yaiba Semimaru could flip over during the chase, preventing the player from entering it.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath -</em> It's no longer possible to trigger the quest if River died during <em>The Hunt</em>.</li>
<li><em>Motorbreath</em> - Players can now acquire the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru through AUTOFIXER even if they failed <em>The Hunt</em>, which normally unlocks the side quest where the vehicle is obtained.</li>
<li><em>Nitro (Youth Energy)</em> - Fixed a game crash that could occur in certain circumstances after leaving the Yaiba showroom event.</li>
<li><em>Nitro (Youth Energy)</em> - Fixed an issue where the proxy interface UI in the Yaiba showroom is cut off when the "Larger HUD Elements" setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several localization and lipsync issues in various languages.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to disable vignette. It can be found in Settings → Graphics → Basic.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on PC and Mac where Ray-Traced Reflections might not display correctly when enabled under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with displaying text messages from Delamain.</li>
<li>Various fixes for fluff vendors.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The patch is out now, so hopefully you've got it downloaded already, but if not, simply boot up your Switch 2 and this should trigger the download automatically.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Straight Roads 2 Gamescom Preview – Climbing the Charts]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-2-gamescom-preview-climbing-the-charts/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-straight-roads-2-gamescom-preview-%E2%80%93-climbing-the-charts.1294662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in 2020, Malaysian game development studio Metronomik released <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-release-august-25/">No Straight Roads</a>, an action-adventure game deeply rooted in music coming with a distinct visual style, and some great boss battles that made it easy to look past the general simplicity of the entire experience. After releasing the Encore Edition featuring additional content, the development studio started working on No Straight Roads 2, a sequel that promises to significantly expand every one of its predecessor's features, from music to gameplay.</p>



<p>During last month's Gamescom, I had the opportunity to meet with Metronomik co-founder and Game Director Wan Hazmer and Business Development Manager Rie Matsuura to talk about the second entry in their series. Much like in 2019, when I met him during the very last <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-straight-roads-hands-on-preview/">E3 in Los Angeles</a> to to talk about the original, Wan Hazmer was very enthusiasiastic about the project, and I feel he had every right to be, as No Straight Roads 2 immediately felt like a massive step up over its predecessor, which did a lot of things right, but whose relatively small scope ultimately impacted the experience negatively.</p>



<p>With No Straight Roads 2, Metronomik is not taking any chances. Bunk Bed Junction is not only heading out of Vinyl City for the first time, but they are also expanding the band, as keyboard player Casey and another yet-to-be-revealed band member will join guitarist Mayday and drummer Zuke. And, for the first time, they will feel like an actual band playing together, as all characters will actually participate in combat when not controlled by any player, fighting mobs and bosses together. The introduction of mobs is only one of the things made possible by Metronomik getting bigger as a game development studio, as the support from publisher Shueisha Games and the addition of more developers allowed the creation of a proper AI system for mobs and characters, but also the creation of much bigger stages that will address the extreme linearity of the original.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>The unique combination of music and action gameplay of the original is also getting significantly expanded in No Straight Roads 2, as the new entry in the series will explore Jazz besides EDM. This new genre, which is considerably more complex than most modern music, will be explored in a rather unusual way, as the developer has injected a Malaysian flair into it, which is sure to make the experience rather unique. The addition of a more complex genre will also impact gameplay in some form, Wan Hazmer told me, although it was difficult to tell exactly how from the short demo playthrough I watched during the session. One thing this playthrough made sure of is how boss fights will once again be the highlight of the experience. The one featured in the demo did an excellent job showing how the gameplay complexity has increased, with mobs joining in the fight, and the music's intensity indicating when the boss is about to unleash a powerful attack. With some new cues indicating when an attack can be parried, perfect dodging, a stun mechanic that allows players to stun enemies if certain conditions are met, a combat arena that changes depending on how the battle is going, taking advantage of a green screen setup in a very clever way to offer some visual storytelling, it's clear how No Straight Roads 2 is setting out to be a more involving experience than its predecessor that will surprise the vast majority of players.</p>



<p>With Hi-Fi Rush in some way revolutionizing the action-rhythm game landscape, I expected No Straight Roads 2 to take more than a few pages from its book, but that is not precisely what Metronomik is doing with their game. While it is undeniable that Tango Gameworks' action title has influenced the game, Metronomik is focused on keeping its identity, using music differently and far less restrictively. Unlike Hi-Fi Rush, where the player is punished for doing things to the beat, No Straight Roads 2 provides incentives for doing so but with no downside if the player doesn't. This is not only a way to make the game more accessible and less restrictive, but also to implement more varied music. In Hi-Fi Rush, every song is rhytmically simple in a 4/4 beat, which makes it easy for players to follow even if they have no music education. With No Straight Roads 2 exploring different musical genres, this wouldn't have worked as well and would have proved to be even more restrictive and punishing. In terms of music, No Straight Roads 2 will also feature all original music, so licensing issues will not force the developer to alter their game down the line.</p>



<p>With so many improvements across the board, including multiplayer, No Straight Roads 2 is setting out to be a much better game than its predecessor. The little I have seen of the game being so interesting already, I cannot wait to see what else Metronomik has come up with, especially how the new bosses will top the already excellent bosses of the original and how the yet-to-be-revealed character will impact an experience that already looks to be tons of fun. Unfortunately, the wait may still be a little long, as No Straight Roads 2 is slated for a generic 2026 release window on PC and yet-to-be-confirmed consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A UK-based video game reseller claims Sega was behind a police raid that seized a trove of Nintendo development kits from his home, according <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/09/sega-accused-of-using-police-to-recover-nintendo-dev-kits-it-had-negligently-disposed-of">to a report from <em>Time Extension</em></a>. The seller, who reportedly purchased the collection from a scrapyard, accuses Sega of getting the police involved to recover the dev kits after mistakenly throwing them out.</p><p>The seller tells the outlet that he purchased the rare finds for around £10,000 (~$13,526) from a worker who showed up at the scrapyard with “a van-load of items that had reportedly come from Sega’s office clearance.” Sega <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/after-more-than-20-years-sonic-will-no-longer-overlook-one-of-the-uks-busiest-roads">moved its Europe office</a> from Brentford, West London, to the city’s Chiswick Business Park earlier this year.</p><p>On July 14th — around three months after the purchase — police arrested the seller and raided his home, according to <em>Time Extension</em>. “I was woken at around 7:30 am by a loud knock at my door,” the seller tells <em>Time Extension</em>. “When I opened it, I was met by approximately ten officers from the City of London Police. They informed me that I was under arrest for money laundering and that they were there to seize development kits and game cartridges.”</p><p>In addition to Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DSi, 2DS, 3DS, Wii, and Wii U dev kits, the collection also included a bunch of prototype games, including <em>Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</em>, <em>Sonic Generations</em>, <em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Winter Olympic Games</em>, <em>Phantasy Star 0</em>, and many others. It’s unclear whether the games were seized by police.</p><p>Just days after releasing the seller, police reportedly asked him to sign a “formal disclaimer request” that asks him to relinquish ownership of the dev kits, indicating that he fairly obtained the consoles. The seller hasn’t heard back from the police after refusing to sign the disclaimer, nor has Sega reached out to him despite being “named in six separate pre-action protocol claims,” he tells <em>Time Extension</em>.</p><p>The rare consoles are still in the hands of the police, and it’s unclear whether they’ll ever see the light of day, <a href="https://x.com/VGPMuseum/status/1965390297900126545">sparking frustration</a> from the video game preservation community. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Sega with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776260/sega-police-raid-nintendo-dev-kits#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776260/sega-police-raid-nintendo-dev-kits]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordvpn-is-free-for-20-months-but-heres-the-condition-you-need-to-meet-2000624896</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nordvpn-is-free-for-20-months-but-here%E2%80%99s-the-condition-you-need-to-meet.1294650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people don’t realize how exposed they are when browsing online until something goes wrong. The truth is, <strong>every click, search, and connection leaves a trace that can be tracked or exploited</strong>. That’s why so many users turn to VPNs (<em>Virtual Private Networks</em>) to protect their digital lives.</p>
<p>And right now, NordVPN (the world’s leading VPN) has an incredible offer that feels like getting nearly two years of service for free: Thanks to a 73% discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">it’s as if you only pay for 7 months at the regular rate and get 20 months free</a>. Spread across the entire 27-month duration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">that works out to just $3.09 a month</a> instead of the usual $11.59. In practical terms, you’re<strong> locking down your online safety for pennies a day</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<h2>Why a VPN Matters More Than Ever</h2>
<p>Think of a VPN as your <strong>own personal shield when you’re on the internet</strong>: Instead of leaving your browsing open to hackers, advertisers or your internet provider, NordVPN protects your data with military-grade encryption (check out Gizmodo’s full review <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn">here</a>). That means no one can peep into your history or watch over your online activities.</p>
<p>NordVPN is especially trustworthy because of its <strong>no-logs policy.</strong> Other providers log your activity, while NordVPN does not record your browsing history at all. And if you want even more protection, its Double VPN mode sends your connection through two different servers and double the encryption but still with your speed kept surprisingly fast.</p>
<p>Aside from simple browsing privacy, <strong>a VPN unlocks doors you might not have considered</strong>: Ever been stuck mid-stream because the show you wanted to watch was geo-restricted where you are? With NordVPN, you can stream off one of its 7,000+ servers in more than 120 locations across the globe, which makes geo-blocked content accessible and video streaming sharp.</p>
<p>Another reassuring touch: speed. Some VPNs are notorious for slowing down your speed, but NordVPN is built to remain fast. Its huge server network means you’ll always be able to get one close by so streaming HD content or video calling remains smooth.</p>
<p>NordVPN doesn’t end at VPN fundamentals either: The Plus plan, currently reduced to about $3.99 monthly also features improvements like Threat Protection Pro. It operates close to antivirus, eliminating malware, irritating ads and trackers that bog down your system otherwise. Aside from this, you are given NordPass, a built-in password manager that protects your logins and puts them under control behind strong encryption.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about how many devices can be covered, NordVPN makes it simple: <strong>you can protect up to 10 devices simultaneously</strong> on a single account.</p>
<p>Best of all, NordVPN comes with a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong>. That means you can try it without risk, and if you don’t believe so, you simply get your money back. Ultimately, the numbers make this deal impossible to refuse: You pay 7 months at the standard rate, and NordVPN adds 20 extra months on top, for free.</p>

We already know that Borderlands 4 will support Shift codes, although we're still waiting for confirmation on <em>what </em>they unlock in the game exactly.</p><p>We're still betting that each code you redeem will still give you Golden Keys that can be used to unlock a treasure chest of rare goodies in the game or new cosmetics that you can apply to your Vault Hunter.

This is quick and easy to do, and you can then activate your Shift codes on the same website or via the in-game Social menu or via Borderland 4's Social menu at launch. The other thing to note about Shift codes is that they typically have expiration dates, so it's a good idea to redeem one as soon as possible.</p><p>From there, you can bank the rewards if they turn out to be Golden Keys, or splurge and use all of them to grab some new gear in one go.

			<p>Sometimes you can tell how a game will play at a first glance, with the huge explosion of Hades clones generally easy to recognise. I went into my first experience with Hell Clock fully expecting a take on Supergiant’s classic but what I found was actually something far more original and interesting, albeit not without some issues and flaws. While it shares the general rogue-like approach of Zagreus’ adventures, the actual gameplay is far more in keeping with classic Diablo, and scratched a nostalgic itch I didn’t realise I had.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Clock | Launch Trailer | Play Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EXoQ_s6ppw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of the game is its real historical backdrop, taking place 8 years after Brazil’s War of Canudos, a tragic event in which tens of thousands of refugees were slaughtered by the new Brazilian Republic in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This is a historical event about which I was totally unaware before coming across this game and it shows how well games can educate alongside entertain. This is exactly the kind of experience that my erstwhile colleagues are looking at in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/playing-with-history-now-live-on-kickstarter/">‘Playing With History’ book</a> and I’ll be recommending they take a gander at Hell Clock.</p>


<p>This real world context doesn’t mean that the game is hyper realistic, however. Indeed, such is the depth of historical trauma surrounding the War of Canudos that the game’s dark fantasy aesthetic feels like a metaphorical attempt to come to terms with those memories. This is most obviously seen through the monstrous bosses that represent major figures in the invading army. These are truly grotesque and prove extremely challenging until you’ve refined your build.</p>


<p>While the general tone of Hellclock is dark the graphics benefit from an excellent balance of light and shade. A cel-shaded comic book effect helps enemies and backgrounds to stand out and there is a decent range of environments across the various stages – although the layouts themselves tend to repeat relatively quickly. Depending on your choice of skills and powers there can be a vast amount of visual effects on display soon and this can be both a blessing and a curse. Fully powered up attacks look incredible but can bring the framerate crashing down – particularly in the last main area of the game.</p>
<p>Performance as a whole here was decent until that last area (one that I won’t spoil here) where the solid 75fps gradually dropped until it fell off a cliff. The one time I beat the final boss was a battle of attrition with 5fps and took fully 35-40 minutes whilst watching a YouTube video. This is not what the game is intended to play as though and says a lot about my general stubbornness and desire to see the ending for this review.</p>

<p>In fact, the main loop of Hellclock is all about speed and min-maxing your builds. The standard mechanics include the titular Hellclock which constantly counts down towards your death – only pausing during boss battles. At first you have a measly 7 minutes but there are upgrades to unlock that increase this and bosses also drop extra time pick-ups when defeated. This mechanic ensures that every run is a test of your dps rather than skill which clearly appeals to the Path of Exile and Diablo players but is a far cry from the Hades style I was expecting.</p>
<p>There is an option to disable the clock and play the game in a more strategic way but after completing the game this way I would advise against it. While this mode does prevent the constant time pressure it ends up becoming a war of extreme attrition and the resultant drawn-out kiting of damage-sponge enemies can quickly sap your enjoyment. I would go so far as to suggest that the devs should probably remove this option and stick to their preferred approach.</p>

<p>Playing as a resurrected victim of the massacre, you’re armed with a revolver that serves as your primary weapon. I was a little disappointed that there are no alternatives here (rifles, shotguns, or sabres could have mixed things up build-wise) but you can level it up and apply buffs through equipped relics to increase your damage. Basic shots are free but all other attacks require mana to activate so there is a balance to be drawn between attacking and allowing your mana to recharge. The real build strategy comes in choosing from a wide range of spells to add to your arsenal.</p>
<p>These skills range from support effects such as dash and shield to more offensive abilities such as rapid fire and high damage explosives and all are well designed to fit in with the general aesthetic. Each set of skills is unlocked as you progress through the game’s acts but some of the early skills remain useful right up to the end. I found a combination of magical crosses that surrounded my character and life steal from equipped relics was overpowered as it meant I survived far longer than my damage output should have allowed but I think this has been balanced in part through patches (and of course would not have helped with the Hellclock in play).</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hellclock is a solid game that offers something new to both the roguelike and Diablo genres but may not have the wider appeal of titles such as Hades due to its focus on min-maxing and DPS over skill. The confused approach of offering game modes that actively undermine the title’s central gameplay mechanic, and the current performance issues in the latter stages, are real negatives but the first can be avoided and the second is being worked on. If the idea of a roguelike Path of Exile appeals, then Hellclock may well be the game for you.	</p></div>

            <p>CD Projekt have rolled out a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch with fixes and tweaks for some of update 2.3's additions. The most noteworthy is what sounds like a pretty hefty revamp of how the autodrive function goes about conveying your ride from A to B.</p>
<p>If you missed it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">arriving back in July</a>, update 2.3 was the final set of new stuff CD Projekt plan to add to the first Cyberpunk, a game they've been physically unable to stop themselves from delving back into over the past couple of years, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Cyberpunk 2 having been in the works for a little while now</a>. To be fair, most of its contents were vehicle and photo mode-related, with the autodrive function and similar Delamain taxi system heaflining alongside some new rides.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you might guess from this <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">patch 2.31's notes</a>, autodrive's a feature that's come with a few kinks for anyone who's tried it. I've been able to rely pretty well on it to get me where I want to go in the on-and-off Cyberpunk playthrough I've had going for about a month now, but it has suffered from constantly jamming the brakes on in a very jarring fashion, as well as occasionally getting stuck or rear ending some poor fellow in a tiny Makigai MaiMai.</p>
<p>The devs have clearly been at work on those hangups, writing that as of this patch: "When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably." Sounds great, assuming other traffic have been se to automatically give way at junctions, otherwise there'll be a rise in Kiroshi dashcam footage of Thortons being t-boned in the near future.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Patch 2.31 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Mac and Nintendo Switch 2!</p><p>This update includes an AutoDrive upgrade and Photo Mode adjustments. It also addresses common issues encountered by players. For details, check the full list of… <a href="https://t.co/Jdpx1DI4V5">pic.twitter.com/Jdpx1DI4V5</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1966081108199809196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Aside from that, there are some fixes for the quests surrounding update 2.3 vehicles like the Semimaru and Muramasa, as well as on that saw Johnny Silverhand always spawn in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cabs. He's always been in back for me, so I must have gotten lucky.</p>
<p>Moving to photo mode, CD Projekt have made "most" of the character poses added update 2.3 work with folks of any gender and disabled NPC collision in the mode. That collision removal's in an effort to "make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision", such as perching Rogue or Kerry on the bonnet of your car.</p>
<p>The last couple of bits I'll highlight are PC-specific fixes. One's for "an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink", which is an equally hilarious and horrifying hardware happening. The second's for path tracing not activating properly in "certain scenarios".</p>
<p>Obviously, patches are the enemy of load orders, so it's worth checking or waiting for mod updates if you don't fancy disabling the likes of this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies">story-driven rent system</a> if you've got them installed. Don't want the landlord selfies being borked next time you chip in, you know?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s grand keynote happened only two days ago, and though <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-blur-the-line-between-health-wearable-and-wireless-earbuds-2000655557">the AirPods Pro 3 were the highlight</a>, Amazon had a different idea: clear out the remaining AirPods Pro 2 at an unbeatable price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">they’re down to $199 instead of the usual $249, and that’s as low as it gets for one of Apple’s most popular earbuds</a>. Amazon wants to move the last of its stock, and if you don’t care about extras like heart rate monitoring or calorie tracking, the AirPods Pro 2 are more than enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>Advanced ANC Earbuds</h2>
<p>The reason the drop is so tempting is that <strong>these earbuds remain some of the most advanced true wireless earphones</strong> Apple has ever produced. They pack the H2 chip which powers improved sound quality and smarter noise cancellation. Active noise cancellation works to block out the hum of traffic, chatter on your commute, or background noise in the office, and Transparency Mode lets the world back in whenever you need to stay aware. On top of that, Personalized Spatial Audio adapts sound to the shape of your ears for a immersive surround-like feel.</p>



<p>The earbuds’ sound profile is accurate and detailed, with bright, even balance between highs, mids, and bass. If you’re looking for audio quality without the bulk of over-ear headphones, this remains one of the best everyday choices.</p>
<p>Apple overhauled the fit to be more comfortable with several ear tip sizes in the box that help create a snug seal. That makes it more effective at noise reduction and reduces ear fatigue during extended listening sessions. Battery life is more than adequate for daily use, <strong>with up to six hours of continuous use on one charge and 30 hours total if you count the charging case</strong>. The case itself charges through USB-C now, so you can charge it with the same cord you’re using for a MacBook or iPad.</p>
<p>There’s the convenience factor, too: <strong>Pairing with iPhone, iPad, and Mac is virtually instantaneous</strong> and technologies like automatic switching mean you’ll remain connected without further tapping or change-of-setting crap. If you’re engaged in a FaceTime call on your MacBook and then get up to answer a call on your phone, the AirPods Pro 2 switch just along with you.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see Amazon cut the price this aggressively on a flagship Apple product. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab a pair, this is pretty much it. At $199 instead of $249, the AirPods Pro 2 bring high-end Apple features to your daily routine without asking you to overspend.</p>
