            <p>
A little less than a year since its debut, seasonal content for Capcom's dino shooter Exoprimal has come to an end. Or, as our Tom just said, it looks like it failed to meteor expectations, and is now set for extinction.
</p>
<p>
"With the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content is now complete," <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/">Capcom</a> announced earlier today.

</figure>
<p>
This now means at the end of season four on 11th July, season one will make a return. 
</p>
<p>"From there, a new season will begin on the first of each month," Capcom said. "In addition, Season Passes 1-3 will be available for sale again. This will allow players to obtain items from all seasons."</p>
<p>
Capcom assured its players all of Exoprimal's gameplay modes will remain available. "This includes the main Dino Survival mode, as well as endgame content such as Savage Gauntlet and Time Loop Rebellion," it said today.
</p>
<p>
"If you're playing alone or match with only a few other players, Bots (AI-controlled Exofighters) will still be added so that you can fully enjoy the Hammerheads' story and reach the ending."

We called the shooter a "surprisingly rich blend of dino-killing and team vs team" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exoprimal-a-surprisingly-rich-blend-of-dino-killing-and-team-vs-team">Eurogamer's Exoprimal review</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"While crafted from familiar pieces, Capcom's latest shooter is an enjoyable combination of mechs, dinosaurs and general silliness," wrote Edwin last July. He awarded it three out of five stars. 
</p>
<p>
I now just wonder if we will ever hear <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">anything more on Dino Crisis</a>. Capcom did share that picture of a bloody dinosaur foot earlier this week...

<p>In a <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new announcement</a> via the official Exoprimal website today, the devs confirmed that new seasonal content for the game is ending. However, online services will still be available.</p>



<p>In the team’s post, they explain that “with the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content has been finished.” The devs also thank fans for playing, and broke down the future of the game.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement says that after Season 4 ends on July 11, “a new season will begin on the first of each month.” This will begin with Season 1, and previous season passes will go on sale again. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Valued Exofighters.</p><p> With the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content is now complete.</p><p> From July 11, Season 1 returns, with subsequent returning seasons and content starting on the first of each month.</p><p> Full info: <a href="https://t.co/P2ZBSmUsCI">https://t.co/P2ZBSmUsCI</a> <a href="https://t.co/HRtig56hHy">pic.twitter.com/HRtig56hHy</a></p></div>— Exoprimal (@exoprimal) <a href="https://twitter.com/exoprimal/status/1809175429737062400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Exoprimal will also continue to offer all existing game modes, adding AI-controlled “Bots” to matches to fill out incomplete lobbies.</p>



<p>Although many things will remain intact, ranks for Savage Gauntlet will naturally “no longer be tabulated after Trial 41.” </p>



<p>In a corresponding <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/other_20240705_001/">blog post</a>, the devs also explained future events. Survival Passes will rotate every month through all four seasons. The post adds that “progression from the previous instance of that season will be carried over.” There will also be weekly campaigns and missions to complete.</p>



<p>Exoprimal only just launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exoprimal-release-date-july-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in July 2023</a>, a dinosaur-themed shooter that still has “Mostly Positive” reviews on Steam. The game is available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. </p>



<p>Capcom most recently held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-next-showcase-announced-for-july-1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Capcom Next” showcase</a>, where it announced that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resident Evil game</a> is in development.</p>

According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1286320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, Exoprimal had a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of just 66 on Valve's platform, with only 41 concurrent players at the time of this article's publication.</p><p><a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom said</a> that with the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content has been finished.

Exoprimal does not currently feature on Capcom’s list of platinum-selling titles, which means it has sold less than one million copies.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exoprimal-review"><u>IGN’s Exoprimal review</u></a> returned an 8/10. “Exoprimal's unique take on the hero shooter genre is a bold one – with its best modes and surprises hidden deep within its goofy sci-fi story – but a variety of fun exosuits, the simple appeal of tearing through thousands of dinos, and great multiplayer design make that grind an easy one to recommend sticking with,” we said.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The rules of marketing apply to all!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/grim-reality-independent-game-developers-publishers-surviving-d%C4%99bek-6evke/">first part,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;I discussed what has happened in our industry recently.

In the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/oh-man-everyone-gaming-industry-knows-do-micha%2525C5%252582-d%2525C4%252599bek-revpf/">second part,&nbsp;</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">I outlined gamers' evolving expectations, the revenue dominance of a few games over thousands, industry consolidation's effect on smaller studios, and economics and data's importance in game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Here, I will demonstrate a toolbox for approaching the strategic analysis of new game ideas to have any chance of succeeding in the cluttered market.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Strategic Ideas for Action&nbsp;"><span>Strategic Ideas for Action&nbsp;</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In traditional industries, various options are available when the market becomes very competitive and new challenges arise. It's also valuable to consider these options in the game development industry, as strategic marketing principles apply across all industries. We have four main market strategies&nbsp;at our disposal, but I will focus on the two most popular ones for this discussion.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Market penetration&nbsp;"><span>Market penetration&nbsp;</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A publisher or developer may choose to compete by utilizing existing game mechanics, features, and settings similar to those previously released by them, targeting the same player base. This&nbsp;approach is resource-intensive and&nbsp;challenging, often leading to price wars and intense competition among numerous rivals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main advantage of this strategy is that it allows the developer or publisher to operate within their established comfort zone without the need to innovate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's important to note that game development penetration in the console and PC market still ranges from 30% to 50%, depending on the country and measurement methods. This indicates that not everyone plays games, suggesting that there is still untapped market potential to explore.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Market development"><span>Market development</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding market development, a publisher or developer can expand their reach by targeting new segments of gamers or exploring new geographical markets. They might also opt for a more targeted approach, honing in on particular markets to serve local fans—be they Polish, German, British, or French enthusiasts. While this strategy may initially seem unconventional, it holds considerable merit upon closer examination.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Naturally, the allure of the vast American and Chinese markets is undeniable, with every enterprise vying to maximize sales in these lucrative arenas. However, therein lies the crux of the challenge: the fierce rivalry.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The battle for the attention of American and Chinese gamers is intense, necessitating colossal promotional budgets and rendering the prospect of making a significant impact increasingly slender.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a well-acknowledged fact that Europe's premier markets—namely the British, German, and French—command between 6 to 11% of the US market's valuation. Yet, in absolute figures, this translates to a substantial $4 to over $6 billion for each market. Securing even a fraction of this pie can spell success for the astute indie developer or publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The essence of market development also lies in exploring new player segments. While unearthing untapped gamers in today's saturated environment might seem akin to finding a needle in a haystack, it is not only feasible but also a venture worth pursuing. The strategy pivots on diversifying communication to resonate with previously unengaged segments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consider&nbsp;forging connections&nbsp;with cultural mediums beyond gaming—films, television series, literature, and music. Such cross-pollination can pique the interest of non-gamers in the gaming universe.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To put it briefly, the current landscape calls for initiatives to captivate those distant from gaming—the individual whose last game purchase was a year prior or the daily mobile casual gamer. This endeavor extends beyond marketing tactics and omnichannel engagement; it necessitates reimagining game design to welcome not just the mid-core but also the casual gamer.&nbsp;This&nbsp;isn't a call for an influx of cozy or hypercasual games but an invitation to weave comfort into the fabric of expansive, serious games designed for major consoles and PCs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is this an arduous undertaking? Undoubtedly. But has it become imperative? It certainly has.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Market evolution also encompasses the adoption of novel distribution avenues. Increasingly, manufacturers, particularly the smaller entities, are contemplating this shift. A prime example is the burgeoning domain of subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PS Now—potentially joined by streaming platforms—representing both a significant hurdle and a golden opportunity for developers. A veteran gaming journalist collaborating with us at Try Evidence encapsulated this sentiment: "My affinity for indie games is strong, yet I increasingly gravitate towards titles on Game Pass or those heavily discounted. Integrating indie games into these services while ensuring visibility and a steady revenue stream simultaneously exerts immense pressure on developers who remain outside these ecosystems."</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Seeking insights"><span>Seeking insights</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the quest for market insights, every marketing strategy hinges on recognizing strategic opportunities that emerge from the disparity between demand and supply. Market research leveraging foundational and reactive data is pivotal in pinpointing these gaps. Essentially, it delves into player behavior and preferences from multiple angles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adaptation of The Business Opportunity Chart by Prof. R. Kozielski from the University of Lodz, Poland, Faculty of Management, Department of Strategy and Enterprise Value Management / questus - CIM Accredited Study &amp; Exam Center by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's face it—crafting innovative and capricious games is a formidable task.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key to success lies in discerning market voids and player necessities to deliver unique Points of Difference (PODs) and compelling Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) that elicit enthusiastic responses from players, media, and influencers alike.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This endeavor begins with rigorous research, a staple in traditional marketing sectors.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As my esteemed mentor in strategic marketing, Prof. Robert Kozielski often remarked:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"Business opportunities are born from the chasm between demand and supply."&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this may seem self-evident, its application in game development still requires broader adoption.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I conduct extensive research for various clients in Try Evidence, safeguarding the results as they confer a direct competitive edge. Nonetheless, we occasionally share insights at industry events. For instance, in late 2020 and early 2021, we surveyed over 2,000 players from the US, Russia, Poland, and Germany, probing their market perceptions and specific needs regarding games. The survey revealed the five most underrepresented genres at the time, reflecting the demand-side elements in the upper echelon of our previous chart (see above).</span></p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Preceding the large-scale global surveys, in-depth interviews with gamers allowed us to sketch out a vast landscape of expectations and frustrations, gaining insights into their gaming psyche. These discussions informed the categories for a subsequent quantitative study, enabling us to gauge the true magnitude of these phenomena.</span></p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers and publishers aiming to dominate a genre or to capture a player segment must use this foundational knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Qualitative research further enriches such data, leading to genuine insights—deep understandings of player needs, behaviors, and emotions.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Insights from gamers&nbsp;represent a comprehensive amalgamation of data regarding their tastes, challenges, and aspirations. Such valuable perspectives are exclusively derived from the players themselves and cannot&nbsp;be fabricated&nbsp;by developers or marketers (which is not as obvious as it may seem).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's crucial to note that, alongside player research, many publishers now also benefit from journalist research. 'Mock reviews,' journalist &amp; designer critiques during various production stages, once scarce, now frequently guide publishers, particularly in navigating the complex and evolving market. Budgets for such analyses are increasingly allocated from the onset of production, even in smaller studios, recognizing the unparalleled value of an unbiased external perspective and the ability to see what can go wrong before it does. These insights facilitate classic SWOT analysis or media reception planning and, if conducted early enough, can inform pivotal project adjustments, saving substantial resources.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's all about the risk mitigation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Elevating Fundamental, Shared Characteristics"><span>Elevating Fundamental, Shared Characteristics</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In pursuing unique differentiators and insights, it's crucial not to overlook the Points of Parity (POPs)—those attributes universally recognized by players within a particular genre or niche. Their significance is well-known, and their importance is widely acknowledged. Yet, mastery over them is not standard. As I've previously highlighted, refining these traits to perfection is essential—the saturated market swiftly weeds out any product that falls short. Consider this: a game that flawlessly executes on genre-specific POPs might garner a score of "merely" 75/100 from rating aggregators in today's landscape. To surpass this threshold—and in today's competitive environment, it's imperative to succeed—a game must exhibit substantial Points of Difference (POD) besides being perfect at POPs.</span></p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the industry's advancements, numerous manufacturers and publishers often showcase, at best, a meticulously designed Point of Parity (POP). More frequently, however, they introduce an array of Points of Indifference—features that, while potentially inconsequential from the players' or industry media's viewpoint, hold paramount importance for game developers.</span></p><p>Adapted from Prof. R. Kozielski from the University of Lodz, Poland, Faculty of Management, Department of Strategy and Enterprise Value Management / questus - CIM Accredited Study &amp; Exam Center by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This tendency frequently leads to the excessive allocation of financial and temporal resources in crafting parts of the game that may ultimately be superfluous.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">*</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous gaming industry and markets, the triumph of smaller developers and publishers will increasingly hinge on their agility to navigate and adapt to swift market changes. This agility includes rewards for innovation, fiscal understanding, and the ability to effectively engage with players and the media. Success will favor those who ground their development and publishing strategies in robust analytics and a profound, qualitative grasp of the gamer psyche. Paramount to this success is the early recognition that the principles of free-market economics, marketing savvy, and consumer psychology apply to the gaming industry and any other sector.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game developers and publishers are not Olympic gods; they cannot manipulate the fabric of reality or economic principles or magically enchant gamers. Ultimately, they are catering to ordinary consumers seeking the highest utilitarian value.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those who excel in their roles as marketers and producers will prevail. Conversely, those who linger in fantasy and excessive bravado will meet their downfall, much like Icarus in his ascent toward the sun.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement on its website</a>, Capcom says that "all planned&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal&nbsp;</em>seasonal content has been finished", and that from this point onward, the game's four seasons will begin to cycle, with Season 1 making a return after Season 4 concludes.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to buy&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal</em>'s first three Season Passes again, so if there was anything you missed the first time around, you'll get another opportunity to snag it soon.</p>

<p>Additionally, Capcom says that all of&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal</em>'s game modes, including the Dino Survival mode, the aforementioned Savage Gauntlet, and the Time Loop Rebellion mode, will remain available.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the game's player count dwindling, Capcom says that bots will continue to be added to multiplayer games if there aren't enough players to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>Still, from this point onward, if you were hoping for more&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal&nbsp;</em>events like the game's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoprimal-monster-hunter-crossover"><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoprimal-title-update-1">new Exosuits</a>, then it looks like you're sadly out of luck.

			<p>The Playstation 4 emulator shadPS4 has made excellent strides in the past few weeks and is now capable of running, albeit in a very limited fashion, one of the best Playstation 4 exclusives ever made.</p>
<p>A new video shared today on YouTube by GeorgeMoralis shows the 0.1.1 version of the emulator running Bloodborne. While the game isn't playable yet, the fact that the emulator can boot it up and even get to the character screen bodes extremely well for the future. If Sony is never going to port the game to PC officially, emulation may, once again, save the day and allow PC players to finally venture to the hauntingly beautiful city of Yarnham.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadps4-v0.1.1 WIP bloodborne progress" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWX0ziJNyew?start=31&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The shadPS4 emulator isn't the only <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-fpps4-can-now-run-multiple-commercial-games/">Playstation 4 emulator</a> in the works, but it is definitely among the most promising. The current version of the emulator is capable of running 3D games in some fashion, including <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1808573859853205578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1808573859853205578%7Ctwgr%5E013c0016b56e002a617cfa2fe94b24555cd8392d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsogaming.com%2Fnews%2Fplaystation-4-emulator-shadps4-v0-1-0-can-run-some-3d-games%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Piece Odyssey, Persona 5, and the Resident Evil Origins Collection</a>. Hopefully, these new developments will eventually lead to games becoming fully playable, which is probably not going to be as difficult as it was to get working Playstation 3 emulation due to the system's architecture.</p>

            <p>Actor David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff - known for his roles in 80s TV series Baywatch and Knight Rider, as well as his music career (I still get Jump in my Car stuck in my head from time to time) - is the new face of an initiative which aims to fight climate change with video games.</p>
<p>It's called <a href="https://bit.ly/4b135Ib">Make Green Tuesday Moves</a> (MGTM). On the first Tuesday of each month, participating studios will launch a collection of 'green' items within their games, with these items being exclusive to the movement. MGTM will then invest proceeds from these items into "fully certified sustainability projects by not-for-profit digital platform PlanetPlay".</p>
<p>And, this month, it is all about that Hoff DLC, with other celebrities expected to follow in subsequent months.</p>

<p>The Hoff himself has starred in several promotional videos for July's initiative push, posing with Knight Rider's KITT and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tg2nR45iuo">whipping himself up a healthy smoothie</a> all in the name of Planet Earth.</p>
<p>"Snag those pixel-perfect skins and lots of other great gear," he says, adding that each "piece of gear is a power up" for the planet. "Your play time turns into green time, zapping pollution and healing the Earth, one epic item at a time!"</p>
<p>Games involved this month are casual <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial?id=mc_games_editorialmd_mgtm_july_fcp&amp;pli=1">Google Play store offerings</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ar-pet-game-peridot-is-nothing-like-pokemon-go-and-more-interesting-for-it">Peridot from Pokémon Go developer Niantic</a> and Solitaire from Tripledot.</p>
<p>Projects this <a href="https://www.planetplay.com/mgtm">initiative will be supporting</a>, meanwhile, include the Hongera Clean Cookstove project - which is "working to improve the livelihoods of poorer families in Kenya, preserve indigenous forestry and reduce global CO2 emissions" - and the Teeny Tiny Truth. This initiative is focused on "reducing the influx of microplastics into New Zealand's fresh water systems".</p>

Ubisoft's sparkling new version of the beloved Beyond Good &amp; Evil includes a touching tribute to Emil Morel, the veteran Ubisoft Montpellier developer who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies">sadly died last year aged just 40</a>. 
</p>
<p>
A bouquet of flowers can now be found lying on a bench in Hillys' centre, with an envelope marked simply by the letter 'E'. 
</p>
<p>
I've checked with Ubisoft to see if this addition is indeed a tribute to Morel from the game's development team, and been told yes.

<p>
Morel served at Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil studio Ubisoft Montreal from 2009, and helped craft the wonderful Rayman Legends as its lead game designer. 
</p>
<p>
More recently, Morel had taken on the role of creative director for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 - the long-awaited successor which is referenced significantly via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">new content added to Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's fitting, then, that this new release also pays tribute, as we wait to see more of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, which remains in development. 
</p>
<p>
"For us, Emile was a close friend and a boundless source of positive energy," Ubisoft Montpellier <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ubisoft-montpellier_cest-avec-une-profonde-tristesse-que-nous-activity-7082727131201294336-I853/">wrote</a> last year. "We all valued his passion and the way he told stories.
</p>
<p>
"We will never forget Emile and his immense contribution to the BGE2 universe will forever endure."
</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-official-reveal-trailer-ahead-of-gameplay-showcase/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will feature a ton of different armor options, and players will not be forced to sacrifice utility for looks, thanks to a "robust" transmog system.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/04/bespoke-armor-transmog-and-other-aspects-of-gear-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Game Informer</a>, the new entry in the series will feature tons of different armor options for both companions and the main character, Rook. Companions will have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot and a weapon slot, while the main character will also have a helmet slot, two weapon slots a belt, an amulet slot and two ring slots. Belts will play an important role, as they influence the potency of healing potions, and some of them can proc additional effects like invulnerability. The game will also feature plenty of bespoke gear that can only be equipped by certain companions or Rook's classes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems like players won't be forced to equip gear in Dragon Age: The Veilguard they think does not look good. Game Director Corinne Busche confirmed the game will feature a robust transmog system that will allow players to apply the stats of a certain piece of gear to another with a different appearance. Both Rook and the companions' gear can be transmogrified as well, giving players the maximum amount of customization options for all their party members.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches later this year on PC, Playstation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights.</blockquote><blockquote>We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone.</blockquote><p>Nintendo’s mixed statement here comes as its video game console rivals go all-in on AI.

That’s enough to put the game in Steam’s top five most-played games. Sony and Microsoft do not share player numbers.

            <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment will exhibit at Tokyo Games Show this year.</p>
<p>The PlayStation maker's presence at the convention was confirmed along with the launch of the <a href="https://tgs.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2024/en/">Tokyo Game Show 2024 visitor's site</a> yesterday (4th July). Sony hasn't had a major presence at the Tokyo Game Show since 2019.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 731 exhibitors have been confirmed to be participating in Tokyo Game Show 2024, with the likes of Sega, Square Enix, Bandai Namco and Nintendo all in attendance. </p>

<p>"The event will be held on the largest-ever scale and will host a total of 3190 exhibition booths, exceeding last year's record in TGS history," the Tokyo Game Show social media account shared yesterday.</p>
<p>As to what Sony will exhibit during this year's show - which runs from 26th September to 29th September - that for now remains a mystery. One of PlayStation 5's biggest upcoming releases, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-channels-the-pure-game-design-of-nintendo-as-playstation-turns-towards-families">Astro Bot</a>, would have already made its debut by that time, with the adorable-looking platforming set to arrive on 6th September.</p>
<p>Other Sony releases this year include its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">God of War Ragnarök on PC</a>.

            <p>Obsidian have spent a lot of time tuning up Avowed's combat in response to negative reactions to the new action-RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-first-person-fantasy-rpg-avowed-is-coming-this-autumn">initial reveal footage at an Xbox developer direct</a>, with gameplay director Gabe Paramo conceding that the team could have oiled the hinges and buffed the contacts a little more before showing the game off.</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-interview-2024#section-creating-the-best-obsidian-rpg-ever-with-avowed">Windows Central</a>, Paramo noted that Obsidian had always planned to give the game's sword-and-sorcery component some love, but were persuaded by the reaction to prioritise this aspect before showing Avowed off again at this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/xbox-games-showcase">Xbox summer showcase</a>. "Sometimes you can lose sight on the importance of the prioritization of some things," he told the site, adding that "we thought [Avowed] was good enough to show as is... A lot of that stuff we knew we were going to get to before shipping." The developers took the feedback in their stride: "We just went 'Okay, let's look at this, this is a big deal, people are noticing this, we should polish this sooner,'" Paramo said. </p>
<p>So where and how have they added some jazz? "We really analyzed the feeling and moment when the player swings their weapon and the moment of impact," Paramo explained. "Were there any delays, was there any system that might have been preventing it from being immediate?" The developers also "looked at posing... to give that visceral, immediate feedback" - posing being, in my very dim understanding of videogame animation, the introduction of character poses that are designed to catch the eye and stick in the memory. "We really focused on that, and the blood impacts, and VFX feedback, and the audio," Paramo went on. "We basically went and looked at all the pieces that make [combat] feel more juicy." </p>
<p>I find this story interesting not least because I'm always interested, and alarmed, to hear about what developers can change after showing a videogame off without giving themselves tonnes of extra work and losing sight of what they're making. Paramo's description sounds like it could be as elementary as changing some speed values somewhere, but it probably isn't. In my experience, every videogame production is a Jenga tower where every last piece is somehow the one right at the bottom.</p>
<p>Here's one thing Obsidian likely couldn't have introduced in response to reveal trailer feedback: Avowed's choice of a first or third-person perspective, because no, it's not as simple as yanking the camera out of your character's head. "[Third-person perspective] is definitely something that requires work to be done after you solidify and understand what game you're making," Paramo commented elsewhere in the piece. </p>
<p>"If I make a swing in first person, I now need to make a swing in third person, in another type of view. They're not shared meshes or animations -- they are different, and our system supports playing them at the same time," he went on. "If you look at your shadow, you'll be able to see the same third-person animations as the first-person representative mesh is doing. So, we had to do it early, because we basically needed to double the amount of animations." </p>
<p>There's more in the full chat, including thoughts on whether Obsidian considered adding multiplayer given the success of Baldur's Gate 3 on his front, and given that Avowed was  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-really-pushed-avowed-as-a-co-op-rpg-pivoted-to-single-player-in-eight-months">"really pushed" internally as a co-op RPG to begin with</a>. Tl;dr it would have messed with the game's storytelling, and Obsidian don't have Larian's long experience of mining the co-op coalface. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-release-date-details-everything-we-know">everything else we know about Avowed</a> at the time of writing.</p>

			<p>A modded Nintendo Switch with 8GB of RAM, instead of the vanilla 4, is almost the Pro model we never got, as it is capable of running multiple PC games rather well.</p>
<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> recently released a new video showcasing multiple PC games running on this modded system with 8 GB RAM, CPU running at 2.6 GHz, and GPU at 1.26 GHz using Box64 + Wine on an L4T Ubuntu 18.04 with custom kernel OS. While the low resolution is obviously expected, some of these games running particularly well. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, for example, manages to run at a respectable 30 FPS or close enough in most scenarios, as does Stray. An older game like Devil May Cry runs even above 30 FPS, which is definitely not ideal for a character action game but is impressive nonetheless. Despite some evident issues unrelated to the hardware, Fallout New Vegas even manages to run at 60 FPS in a small indoor location and at around 30 FPS in the more open areas.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we have seen evidence of how the limited amount of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-ram-performance/">RAM</a> impacted the Nintendo Switch the most, as the modded system showcased in today's video was also able to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-oled-modded-8-gb-ram/">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at 4K resolution.</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo seems well aware of the issue and will likely ensure that the Nintendo Switch successor has enough RAM to run modern games smoothly. According to shipment data, the console should sport 12 GB of RAM, which could deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-appears-to-be-teasing-another-secret-character<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Japanese website for Sonic x Shadow Generations appears to be teasing another possible playable character.
</p>
<p>
The Sonic Generations remaster includes both classic and modern Sonic characters, as per the original release, as well as a brand new campaign for nemesis Shadow the Hedgehog.
</p>
<p>
Under the <a href="https://sonic.sega.jp/SonicXShadowGenerations/character.html?sideQuery=0&amp;charaQuery=0">character section of the website</a> all three characters are shown, along with a blank box with the words "coming soon". But who could it be?

</figure>
<p>

Perhaps the most obvious suggestion would be some form of Classic Shadow character to match Sonic. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka previously told Eurogamer</a> the game would not include Classic Shadow levels, though it will feature 2D elements in the level design.

</p>
<p>
Presuming this is a playable character to fit in existing levels, could Super Shadow be included as a separate character? Or could we see Metal Sonic as an additional, playable nemesis? (He's already a boss in Sonic's campaign)
</p>
<p>
Maybe it's not a bad guy at all, which would open the door to anyone: Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Rouge, or even Trip from Sonic Superstars. Dare I say it: Big the Cat fishing minigame?
</p>
<p>
However, as fan account <a href="https://tailschannel.com/tailschannel/07-04-24-statement/">Tails' Channel</a> suggests, this may not be a playable character at all and just a featured character. In short, don't get your hopes up just yet.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-release-date-leaks-ahead-of-potential-summer-game-fest-reveal">Sonic x Shadow Generations will release on 25th October</a> across PS5, Xbox One/Series X/S, Switch, and PC. That's ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jim-carrey-returns-as-dr-robotnik-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a>, which will feature Shadow the Hedgehog.

Cut voice lines have been discovered for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree's final boss.
</p>
<p>
A dataminer discovered the lines in the game's internal files when comparing English and Japanese dialogue and shared to reddit.
</p>
<p>
The lines themselves don't offer any groundbreaking insight, but it's certainly an interesting decision to cut the lines. <strong>Major spoilers for the final boss follow</strong>.

<p>

The lines in question are attributed to Radahn, the DLC's final boss, who is completely mute in the final game.
</p>
<p>
The three lines read: "I am Radahn", "Born of red-maned Radagon, and Rennala of the Full Moon", and "A lion bred for battle".
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1duo7us/cut_dialogues_from_dlc_spoilers/">Cut dialogues from... (DLC Spoilers)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LaMi_1/">u/LaMi_1</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/">EldenRingLoreTalk</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
Of course, we already know who Radahn is from the base game, so this doesn't add to his character. But the decision to remove the lines does link to his relationship with Miquella.
</p>
<p>
It might seem strange that Radahn is silent, but my own interpretation is that - as Miquella's Promised Consort - he is essentially Miquella's voiceless puppet. After all, this is the Land of Shadow and a separate realm from the base game where the player already defeated Radahn.
</p>
<p>
Having Radahn speak would have given him agency away from Miquella's "brainwashing", as a popular fan theory noted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-final-boss-cut-dialogue-lines/">Game Rant</a> suggests.

</p>
<p>
What's more, the item description for the Remembrance of a God and a Lord acquired by defeating Radahn and Miquella states Miquella saw Radahn's "strength and his kindness". Having Radahn roar that he's "a lion bred for battle" would have undermined this.
</p>
<p>
Have you finished Shadow of the Erdtree? What did you think of the final boss?
</p>
<p>
Many players have criticised the DLC for its high difficulty, but in subsequent patches FromSoftware has eased the challenge. Last week the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">balance of Shadow Realm Blessings was revised</a>, while yesterday <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-1123">a couple of bosses were tweaked to make them easier</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dagon-by-h.p-lovecraft">Dagon: by H. P. Lovecraft</a> developers Bit Golem announced this week that they’ve raised 200,000 złoty (around $50,000) towards humanitarian aid charities aiding Ukranians, including the Polish Red Cross, Save the Children, and Voices Of Children. Dagon itself is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free game</a>, but has several pieces of paid DLC, all of which are currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481400/Dagon_by_H_P_Lovecraft/">on sale</a>.</p>

<p>The two-person Polish dev team - who have previously delved into less terrifying waters with work on Ultimate Fishing Simulator - have also hit 1,700,000 downloads of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> since launch in 2021.

<p>“We debuted Dagon in 2021 as a narrative experiment and our first non-commissioned game,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1481400/view/4221643401484539056">write</a> Bit Golem. “It became a significant success, and as of the latest transfer, together with you - players from all over the world - we have collected over PLN 200,000 / 50,000$ for charity (organisations such as the Polish Red Cross, Polish Humanitarian Action, Save the Children, or Voices Of Children)! Thank you!”</p>
<p>Alongside a new DLC for Dagon to thank their community, Bit Golem are currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873750/Pool_of_Madness/">Pool Of Madness</a> - quite literally, Lovecraftian pool. With balls and cues and tables. That pool, but with tentacles and roguelike elements. I wrote about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pool-of-madness-is-pool-by-way-of-lovecraft">demo here</a>, saying “I can only imagine someone said ‘Cue-thulhu’ by mistake and took it from there.” What a clever little sausage I am.</p>

		<p>We’re massive RPG fans here at TSA, and they don’t get much bigger than the Ys series. Ys X: Nordics is the long-awaited next entry in the series, and while it released in Japan last September, Western gamers have had to patiently wait for news of its release on these shores. Fortunately, they don’t have to wait too much longer, with the game’s release date set for the 25th of October, 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ys X: Nordics - Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iEK29mNDsI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, you’ve got a host of places to play – sorry Xbox gamers – where you’re going to be exploring uncharted islands, engaging in fast-paced action combat, and experiencing adventures on the high seas with central protagonists Adol and Karj. Despite only releasing in Japan so far, it’s been well received so far, with an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15589/ys-x-nordics">Opencritic rating of 83</a>, and praise for its enjoyable storytelling and classic RPG styling.</p>
<p>A physical Limited Edition will be available to pre-order exclusively from the&nbsp;<u><a id="yiv0913458192LPlnk" title="https://store.nisaeurope.com/" href="https://store.nisaeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NIS UK &amp; EU Online Store</a></u>&nbsp;today at 10:00am BST.&nbsp;A special bundle will also be available to pre-order which includes the Limited Edition and a Lil’ Adventurer Adol Plush and a Lil’ Pirate Princess Karja Plush Set.</p>
<p>With this being the tenth release in the series, Ys has clearly found a legion of fans over the years, and that shows little sign of slowing down with the recent announcement that we would also see a remaster of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/02/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-announced-for-ps5-ps4-and-switch/">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghast</a>, originally release as Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, in the near future.</p>


<p>The most recent Ys title to release here was Ys IX: Monstrum Nox in 2021, and once again it received high praise from Miguel, our resident Ys expert, who awarded it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-review/">8/10</a>, saying, “Ys IX: Monstrum Nox is the most ambitious Ys game to date, delivering a larger focus on narrative and a much more involved and organic world to explore. The game stumbles under its ambitions a bit, with a slow opening chapter and a consistently struggling framerate. Despite those issues, though, this is easily one of the best entries in the long-running franchise, and while veteran fans will get a lot out of the callbacks sprinkled throughout the game, newcomers are still in for one of the best action RPGs of the year.”</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on Ys X: Nordics as we get closer to October 25th!</p>

			<p>Modding group Team Luminescent is seemingly working on native unofficial decompiled PC ports of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the team took to X with the "biggest news" in the history of its Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl mod. A video was shared showing the booting of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. According to the modding team, not only do the games boot, but main menu can be accessed as well. "It may not look too pretty now, but in time, it will be the best base for fangames/romhacks", the team <a href="https://x.com/LuminescentTeam/status/1808700107820577272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>With Nintendo being notorious for taking down fan projects, emulation, ROM hacks, and what not, the team will be implementing legal protections to make sure the project won't be taken down. As such, no assets of the game will be included with the project, and these unofficial PC ports will require users to have a legal rip of the Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl roms. As<a href="https://x.com/LuminescentTeam/status/1808721795845140898" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> noted</a> by the team, users can "only use created assets or ones from the game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, once finished, these unofficial native ports will offer vastly improved performance compared to running these games via an emulator. "Additionally, it will run 100% natively on whatever platform you export to. This means *exponentially* better performance than running it through an emulator. Not to mention, inserting assets will be MUCH easier than it currently is with a romhack."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-and-shining-pearl-remakes-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a> were released back in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch. Both versions are remakes of 2006's Pokemon Diamond and Pearl for the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>It's an interesting project for sure, and we're pretty sure that Pokemon fans will be excited by this news. Earlier this year, we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/second-native-zelda-majoras-mask-pc-port-released-recompiled-project-adds-analog-camera-support-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported on native <span>recompiled</span> PC port of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a>.</p>

		<p>This is the week of too many free-to-play games. I wanted to start The First Descendant, I have started Zenless Zone Zero, but I mostly spent my time playing Star Wars Hunters which is a surprisingly enjoyable arena shooter for Switch and mobile. Other than that, it’s been Elder Scrolls Online: The Gold Road, and I checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/01/dustborn-preview-a-comic-book-masterclass-of-superpowers-puritans-and-punk-rock/">Dustborn</a> for a preview.</p>

<p>Checking in with the team, Aran has been playing Blacksad Under The Skin for review, and some Football Manager 24. He gave us a full rundown, saying, “I got sacked by United, hired by Nottingham Forest after they got relegated after only managing 15 points in the season. Came in, sold a load of players, got new ones in. We’re currently 4th in the Championship and are in the 4th round of the Carabao Cup, beating rivals Derby 8-0 in the 3rd round.”</p>
<p>After Death Stranding, Jim finally started on Cyberpunk 2077 despite having had it since launch! It was still in the cellophane! He told us, “I’m glad I held out as there have been plenty of major updates and quality of life improvements, as well as the free PS5 upgrade. I have to say that I really wasn’t gelling with the game’s opening couple of hours. However, I remember feeling the same way about The Witcher III and, sure enough, once the training wheels started to peel away, I felt more at home with Cyberpunk’s mix of FPS and RPG gameplay.”</p>


<p>Meanwhile, Reuben has been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, which will have a review in progress next week. He’s also been dipping back into Ace Attorney thanks to the recent Nintendo Direct with another playthrough of Spirit of Justice. He says, “It’s still the weakest of the Apollo trilogy, but damn if the writing isn’t stellar at points.”</p>
<p>Over in the US, Miguel has been playing a bunch of Elden Ring, but as of last night Zenless Zone Zero has officially launched so now he’s putting all of his free time into it and absolutely loving it. That’s not all though, as he says, “I’ve also been playing a bit more of my gacha game guilty pleasure Nikke Goddess Of Victory this week than usual bc theyve just launched a massive Dave The Diver collab where you literally play Dave The Diver as a “minigame” inside this anime girl game. Technology!”</p>

<p>Steve has finally played some Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and luckily he thinks it’s really good! He says, “Combat is functional but the story and worldbuilding are fantastic. I’ve also put some time into a couple of review titles, NES World Championship and Magical Delicacy. Started Sons of the Forest with my old man online group which is pretty fun.”</p>
<p>This week, Ade and his partner have been smashing through Diablo IV. He told us, “We’re really enjoying it, though oddly, I gotta say, we’re finding the game too easy. We’ve got it set to the 2nd World Tier (the other tiers are currently locked) but few of the bosses even slow us done, let alone stop us. Not sure if we’ve done something wrong (or right, I guess?) But hopefully the challenge will pick up, otherwise the combat is going to become pretty repetitive.”</p>
<p>What about you? Played anything good?</p>

			<p>Today, Falcom and NIS America unveiled the Western release date for Ys X: Nordics. The single player action RPG will be available starting October 25 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ys_x_nordics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ys-x-nordics-0ed760?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-announced-for-playstation-consoles-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in December 2022, the game launched in Japan on September 28, 2023, albeit only for consoles. A Windows PC port debuted in Asian markets on March 14, 2024.</p>
<p>Chronologically, Ys X: Nordics <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-will-be-set-after-first-two-entries-in-the-series-first-footage-coming-early-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takes place after the first two entries in the franchise</a>. There are also some major gameplay changes, as the game only features two playable characters rather than the usual party. New features include sailing and ship combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-forbidden-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Guerrilla Games had been working on LEGO Horizon Adventures, a spin-off title based on the post-apocalyptic franchise.</p>
<p>The official announcement came at Summer Game Fest 2024, when we discovered that the Dutch team had partnered with Studio Gobo to develop a fully multiplatform game scheduled to launch this Holiday on PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Well, not quite 'fully', as Microsoft's Xbox console is missing.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/astro-bot-team-asobi-lego-horizon-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Stephen Totilo's Game File</a> on the topic, Guerrilla Games Narrative Director James Windeler said:</p>
<p><em>Right now, we're just very much focused on pushing this hardware to its limits and making this game look as absolutely amazing as it can possibly be on this hardware, and you know, we don't really have anything to announce about Xbox right now.</em></p>
<p>To be honest, it's not really a convincing reason. The developers may be pushing PS5 to its limits, but the game is also launching on the Nintendo Switch, and the Xbox Series X is certainly at least as capable as the PlayStation 5 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-ps5-often-runs-games-better-than-the-allegedly-more-powerful-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">albeit with some differences</a>). With that said, they didn't say never to an Xbox version, so it's not out of the realm of possibility. On the other hand, Sony really doesn't like publishing its games on its chief rival console unless it absolutely has to, like with MLB The Show.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures sadly won't support co-op online play either, as Guerrilla Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-switch-for-everyone-no-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier. Still, it should be a fun romp, especially for kids.</p>
<p><em>In a far future, where giant mechanized beasts roam a landscape reclaimed by nature and humans live in primitive tribes, an ancient evil seeks to destroy the world…</em></p>
<p><em>Join hunter Aloy as she leads a colourful crew of heroes on a quest to save the meadows, forests, and mountains of Earth from a man called Helis, who leads a gang of sunworshippers that follow an Ancient Evil shrouded in mystery.</em></p>
<p><em>Dive into a thrilling adventure alone, or with friends with couch co-op or online play, customize your home in true LEGO style, and uncover stunning secrets from Aloy’s mysterious past along the way.</em></p>
<p>In other Horizon news, Rolling Stone has <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/umbrella-academy-steve-blackman-abuse-allegations-1235047142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-is-in-the-works-by-the-umbrella-academys-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix TV show</a> isn't moving forward anymore due to the allegation made against showrunner Steve Blackman.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best LVOA-C Loadout in XDefiant [Season 1 Update]]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-lvoa-c-loadout-in-xdefiant/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-lvoa-c-loadout-in-xdefiant-season-1-update.919377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-lvoa-c-loadout-in-xdefiant/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The LVOA-C was added to XDefiant with the Season 1 update, and many players that favour mid to long-range combat gravitated to it almost instantly. It hits hard and doesn’t offer much in the way of recoil from stock, but there’s plenty that you can do to make this weapon one of the most formidable ARs in the game. To that end, we’re breaking down the best LVOA-C loadout in XDefiant – all you need to do is unlock the weapon, acquire the attachments, and soak up the kills.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-lvoa-c-in-xdefiant">How to Get The LVOA-C in XDefiant</h2>



<p>The LVOA-C, which has a TTK that beats out the fan-favourite M4A1, is easy enough to unlock. If you’ve ever played Call of Duty, you’ll note that it’s a similar operating method.</p>



<p>To unlock the LVOA-C in XDefiant, you’ll need to progress to rank 20 of the battle pass, whereupon you’ll unlock the powerful AR free of charge. It’s a bit of a grind, but you can of course jump up the battle pass faster by buying tiers or securing the Premium Pass, which comes with 12 tier skips – you’ll only need to get through eight ranks to get the LVOA-C.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-lvoa-c-loadout">Best LVOA-C Loadout</h2>



<p>Here’s the best build for the LVOA-C in XDefiant:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compensator </strong>Muzzle</li>



<li><strong>Vertical Grip </strong>Front Rail</li>



<li><strong>Extended Mag </strong>Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Heavy Grip </strong>Rear Grip</li>



<li><strong>Padded </strong>Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>With this LVOA-C loadout, you’ll be keeping your recoil low while prioritising lead down range, with the extended magazine providing much-needed extra ammunition to beat XDefiant’s inherently slow TTK. You’ll be given boosts to avoid flinching when firing and the Padded Stock brings a strong control buff, which means that sustained fire and target acquisition will both be a walk in the park for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-alternate-attachments-for-the-best-lvoa-c-loadout">Alternate Attachments for the Best LVOA-C Loadout</h2>



<p>If you want to prioritise power and introduce more recoil, throw on the Chrome Lined Barrel and Barrel Extender, replacing the Heavy Grip with the Quick Draw Grip to claw back some ADS speed.</p>



<p>If fully negating your recoil is what you’re after, swap the Padded Stock for a Reinforced Stock and forgo the  Heavy Grip for the Grip Tape to increase your control of the weapon. Then, adding a Stabilizing Barrel and combining it with a Compensator is all you need to do to make the recoil on the LVOA-C almost non-existent – simple!</p>

<p>Ubisoft has partnered with Double Jump.Tokyo to ‘accelerate’ global web3 game adoption, using an all-new platform called Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles to push a series of NFTs into the faces of gamers worldwide. This isn’t Ubisoft’s first foray into the blockchain-backed world of NFTs, though – toward the end of 2021, the firm revealed Quartz, a full-fledged NFT-based platform that fell flat on its face <strong>so </strong>fast.</p>



<p>Since then, Ubisoft linked up with Immutable to try again to make something valuable out of NFTs, but nothing tangible has yet come of that relationship. So, it’s Ubisoft hoping that the third attempt will be the best yet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-go-again">Here We Go Again</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.doublejump.tokyo/post/double-jump-tokyo-and-Ubisoft-Accelerate-Global-Web3-Game-Adoption">a recent press release</a>, it was revealed that Ubisoft has partnered with Double Jump.Tokyo to integrate web3 mechanics into Champions Tactics, a new player-vs-player tactical RPG that Ubisoft is working on. Following successful integrations with other developers and publishers, Double Jump.Tokyo has joined forces with one of the most impactful names in gaming – but it’s not something that’ll go down well in the wider community. </p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of Double Jump.Tokyo, Hironobu Ueno, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Joining forces with Ubisoft marks a significant milestone for double jump.tokyo. We are thrilled to explore the potential of web3 and digital ownership in gaming alongside Ubisoft. Partnering with a renowned global industry leader like Ubisoft empowers us to continue our unwavering pursuit of delivering exceptional games to communities while accelerating the worldwide adoption of web3 gaming technology.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft uncovered Champions Tactics last year, but it went relatively silent on the project until now. At the end of 2023, the firm released 9,999 ‘Warlords’ NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, making them free to mint and giving them the function of being ‘tickets’ for the impending release of playable characters: The Champions.</p>



<p>Through the power of Double Jump.Tokyo’s Oasys Layer 2 HOME Verse blockchain, players will be able to mint three Champions without any charge, with the offer going live from July 18. They’ll need three Champions in a squad to compete against other players, and each Champion they mint will have a unique look and range of abilities.</p>



<p>Will this latest venture be a success for Ubisoft?</p>
