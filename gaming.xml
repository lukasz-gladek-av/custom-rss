            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167052/sony-the-last-of-us-interview-neil-druckmann-retraction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">has pulled a controversial interview</a> with Neil Druckmann, head of <em>The Last of Us</em> developer Naughty Dog.</p></div><p>Last week, Sony published a (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240523130340/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">now archived</a>) Q&amp;A with the <em>Last of Us</em> creator about the “Evolution of Storytelling.” In the interview, Druckmann spoke about the role of AI in game development, the impact of new technologies on storytelling, advice for new creators, and his hopes for a dream project.</p><p>Since such interviews with high-profile, AAA creators are relatively rare, news outlets picked up the interview, focusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423">Druckmann’s comments</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann-says-ai-will-revolutionize-how-content-is-being-created">about generative AI</a>. Regarding AI Druckmann said:</p><div><blockquote><p>“Moreover, AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we’re reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Druckmann also expanded on other uses for AI, saying, “AI will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities. However, it’s crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes.”</p><p>Additionally, Druckmann shared his aspirations for future games, expressing excitement for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735862/naughty-dog-new-single-player-game-multiplayer">Naughty Dog’s next project</a>: “I’m eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of <em>The Last of Us</em>, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.”</p><p>However, his comment about “redefining mainstream perceptions of gaming” is what appears to be the cause for Sony pulling the interview. Shortly after Sony published the Q&amp;A, Druckmann wrote on social media stating that he had been misquoted.</p><p>“In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost,” <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837">he posted on X</a> sharing his full, unedited comments.</p><p>A few days after making this statement, Sony announced that rather than add Druckmann’s clarification, it had removed the interview entirely, stating, “[We] have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects).” </p><p>Although <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/29/update-sony-pulls-down-heavily-misquoted-neil-druckmann-interview-and-apologizes-for">some</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming-update">media</a> <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/neil-druckmann-says-new-naughty-dog-title-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming/">outlets</a> did focus on the potential of Naughty Dog’s latest project “redefining gaming,” it was Druckmann’s comments on AI that caused the most backlash. The use of AI in creative spaces like video game development has caused a lot of controversy with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23700619/ai-game-development-jobs-gdc-2023">concerns that the technology has the potential to exacerbate</a> the already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065868/a-dark-shadow-falls-across-the-gaming-industry">depressed video game labor market</a>. Notably, the clarification Druckmann posted didn’t include any mention of AI while Sony’s retraction statement did. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167147/discord-gaming-focus-redesign<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Discord wants to steer its app back to gaming, and it’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7V5jdOjWVU4">rolling out an app redesign</a> to help make that happen. The new look features reworked group messages, voice chats, video calls, and more.</p><p>In <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter">a message to users</a>, Discord CEO Jason Citron says the company realized it needs to  narrow its focus from “broadly being a community-centric chat app” to a service that “helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests.”&nbsp;The company now wants to make it easier to connect before, during, or after playing a game.</p><p>This year, Discord will make some changes to the app that will let users reach their conversations faster, as well as improve the reliability of its voice, video, and streaming technology. The company also plans to bring more of Discord’s features to a broader range of devices. </p><p>By turning its attention back to gaming, Discord is reversing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308194/discord-gaming-users-safety-center-video-voice-chat">the plan it set in motion in 2020</a>. As the covid pandemic increased the need for messaging platforms like Discord, the company wanted to become a more general chat app that allowed users to “spend quality time with people, whether catching up, learning something, or sharing ideas.”</p><div><p>A lot has changed since then. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034705/discord-layoffs-17-percent-employees">Discord laid off 17 percent of its staff</a> after growing its headcount too quickly. Citron was also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981662/meta-x-tiktok-ceos-testify-us-senate-child-exploitation">one of the five CEOs who testified</a> in front of the Senate over concerns about child safety. Lawmakers are currently pushing for legislation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24086559/kids-online-safety-act-schatz-tech-groups">like the Kids Online Safety Act</a>, which would require platforms like Discord to roll out measures to protect kids.</p></div><p>During an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308194/discord-gaming-users-safety-center-video-voice-chat">interview on <em>Decoder</em> in April</a>, Citron hinted at turning the company’s attention back toward gaming. “Going forward, we are very focused on gaming as our core use case — group chat around gaming,” Citron said at the time, adding that 95 percent of its users play games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I played <em>Persona 5 </em>and <em>Royal </em>on PlayStation, but when the <em>Persona </em>games came to PC, I was most excited about the prospect of a mod to let me romance Ryuji after headcanoning my version of Joker as in love with him. I don’t know that I have time for another 100+ hour trip to the Metaverse, but if I do ever replay <em>Royal </em>down the line, I may just download it on PC to install this mod.</p><p><em>Persona</em>’s relationship with queerness has been fraught, but recent games have turned things around a bit. <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-trans-scene-beautiful-lady-beach-1851206294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-trans-scene-beautiful-lady-beach-1851206294">takes out an infamous transphobic scene</a></span> in the remake, and it also retools other scenes to be explicitly queer.

Those for games jumping into the Top 20 for the month were Sea of Thieves, which just launched on PlayStation 5 in April; Fallout 76 and Fallout 4, both jumping in popularity due to the success of Amazon Prime’s Fallout TV show; and Grounded, which also released for PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch in April after being an Xbox exclusive.</p>



<p>As far as year-to-date sales, Helldivers 2 remains the best-selling game of 2024 in the United States. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Dragon’s Dogma 2, MLB: The Show 24, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth round of the top five for the year so far.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant.884241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="149" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Players have yet to come around fully, but the MK 20 SSR is not only the best marksman rifle, but also one of the most powerful weapons in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">According to stats provided by <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/xd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the MK 20 SSR has a faster time-to-kill speed up to 35 meters away than the ACR 6.8, AK-47, M16A4, and M60. You must consider that the MK 20 SSR is a single-shot rifle with only a 10-bullet magazine. However, if you are accurate with your aim, it’s possible to take down an enemy in two shots, or even one on an already weakened enemy. This marksman rifle requires a bit of a learning curve, as you will get punished with missed shots. </p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Despite being a marksman rifle, the MK 20 SSR does not thrive in long-range engagements. A massive damage dropoff after 40 meters means you should prioritize shorter gunfights. In saying that, it’s hard to find a better weapon than the MK 20 SSR offers from most ranges. </p> <h2 id="h-best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best MK 20 SSR loadout and class setup in <em>XDefiant </em></h2> <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Barrel Extender </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Pistol </li> <li><strong>Optics: </strong>Reflex </li> <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Fast Mag </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Lightweight </li> </ul> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">Our loadout focuses on making the MK 20 SSR more mobile without sacrificing recoil control or damage range. This marksman rifle barely moves when firing, so all the attachments can be used in other areas. As mentioned earlier, the weapon only has 10 bullets per magazine, so the fast mag improves reload times. All of the other attachments improve ADS and movement speed. \</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best faction to use for the MK 20 SSR </h2> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">The Libertad faction works with every weapon, as it’s always helpful to have abilities that heal you and your teammates throughout a match. But we wouldn’t recommend using the Echelon Faction, as the stealthy skills are more useful while using an SMG. Since the MK 20 SSR thrives in medium-range engagements, using the Phantoms or Cleaners Faction makes the most sense. </p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="759" data-injectable="false">As a Cleaner, the MK 20 SSR deals more damage and kills from further away thanks to the incendiary rounds passive ability. Additionally, the Incinerator Drone is great for drawing enemies out from behind cover and the Firebomb is one of the best grenade options in the game. For the cherry on top, the Purifier Ultra ability is a flamethrower that melts players almost instantaneously.</p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Last week, Sony published an interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann that included some controversial comments about the use of AI in game development and the potential for Naughty Dog’s next game to shake up the gaming industry. Now, the interview has been banished to the Internet Archive.</p> <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false">Sony has retracted the entire interview, and if you try to pull it up, you’ll instead find a message that says: </p> <blockquote data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"> <p>“In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects).” The statement goes on to apologize to Druckmann for misrepresenting his comments and says that the decision to remove the interview was made “in coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE.”&nbsp;</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">The interview caused quite a stir when it was first published, and Druckmann caught heat online for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/neil-druckmann-hypes-up-using-ai-for-storytelling-but-plenty-fellow-devs-disagree/">comments he made about AI</a> and its potential for use in game development. In the interview he came across as being very enthusiastic about developers adopting AI, and his main concern about the tech seemed to be making sure it was given proper direction.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="754" data-injectable="true">People were obviously upset to hear someone like Druckmann gloss over widespread concerns about AI being used in game development, but not long after Sony published the interview, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-last-of-us-director-reveals-discrepancies-in-comments-from-recent-sony-interview/">Druckmann </a>cast doubt on its accuracy. He shared a <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408">post on Twitter</a> pointing out how, “In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">The example Druckmann gave was from a section where the original interview quoted him as saying Naughty Dog’s next game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.” The full quote that Druckmann shared made it clear he hadn’t said anything close to that. Unfortunately, Druckmann still hasn’t addressed the part of the interview where he talked about AI. </p> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="false">Maybe we’re supposed to assume, now that it’s been removed, the published interview misrepresented all of Druckmann’s statements, but the looming threat of AI to actual workers in the game industry is big enough that some specific clarification is absolutely warranted.</p>

<p data-characters="88" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A game like <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> can always work well on services like EA Play.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">The upcoming college football simulator features online modes, including its variant of Ultimate Team. If EA Play subscribers can play the game from day one, it will ensure a lot of online traffic. However, it’s almost certain that the only option for gamers will be to buy a copy on a console of their choice (available on current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles).</p>  <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">The EA Play Pro tier is a pricier version of the base membership and includes all Electronic Arts’s latest releases from day one of their launch. However, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/does-ea-sports-college-football-25-support-cross-play/">EA Sports College Football 25</a></em> will not be available on either the base or Pro version.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Usually, games released on PC are included in the Pro membership. <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Play-Console/EA-Play-Pro-to-PS5/m-p/12241291#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20EA%20Play,is%20not%20available%20on%20consoles).">As per EA’s website</a>, the Pro service isn’t available on consoles. Similarly, <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> won’t be releasing on the PC platform (although <em>Madden 25</em> is already listed on Steam). This is perhaps the main reason the upcoming college football video game is absent from any kind of subscription service.</p> <figure data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">However, there will be some benefits for EA Play subscribers if they’re interested in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/ea-play">As stated on EA’s website</a>, all active subscribers will enjoy the following privileges:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>10-hour early access trial starting July 16</strong></li> <li><strong>10% discount on College Football points for recurring purchases</strong></li> <li><strong>Monthly packs</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="false">You can pre-order the game on your consoles – <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-editions-overview-which-to-buy/">there are two different editions</a>. The Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, while the Digital Deluxe Edition costs $99.99. As an alternative, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-ea-sports-college-football-25-prices-standard-edition-deluxe-edition-mvp-bundle/">EA Sports MVP Bundle</a> offers the Digital Deluxe Editions of this game and <em>Madden 25</em> at a discounted price of $149.99. It’s a great choice for anyone looking to invest a lot of time and resources in both games. </p>

            <p>With an effectively infinite universe to fill in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a>, developers Hello Games have certainly risen to the challenge of trying to fill it with as much stuff as they possibly can over the last near-decade, still managing to add major new features and modes eight years on from the sci-fi exploration game’s release. Next update Adrift is taking things right the way back, though, by emptying the expansive cosmos of almost everything except you, your ship and planets to visit.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<p>The incoming expedition was apparently inspired by No Man’s Sky as it was pre-release, where the player was alone to explore a vast galaxy. Adrift will recreate that sensation of being a lone galactic traveller, taking all other lifeforms - aside from sandworms and fiend eggs - out of the game. That also presents a new survival test, as there won’t be any NPCs to ask for aid - including no shops. Shortcuts are also out, as is trading and other help.</p>
<p>“There’s so much we love about the game now, but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe,” Hello Games wrote in their <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/">announcement blog</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to the eerie feeling of being alone in the abyss is the presence of broken and abandoned buildings, graves of other travellers, and the addition of new ghostly frigates to recruit. You’ll have a new ship to zoom around by yourself in, too: the chunky Iron Vulture hauler. That’ll mean new customisation options <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-brings-full-ship-customisation-and-a-complete-space-station-overhaul">as introduced in last update Orbital</a>, to boot.</p>

<p>Surviving the solo challenge will net you new rewards including a scuttler companion, stealth paint for your ship and both the Iron Vulture and ghost frigate, which can be used across all your saved games via the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion. The Adrift expedition will run for around seven weeks, during which you can give it a go via the Expedition Terminus on the Space Anomaly (or by starting a new save, which you can convert to a normal save once it ends).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thelma-is-a-geri-action-movie-that-doesn%E2%80%99t-miss-a-step.884214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164155/thelma-movie-preview-action-comedy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="FpkZGy">Everyone knows summer is the domain of the action blockbuster. It’s a time for gunfights, car chases, death-defying stunts, and nefarious crimes that have to be thwarted. And while all those things have largely fallen to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24102009/edge-of-tomorrow-tom-cruise-streaming-doug-liman">stars like Tom Cruise</a> to handle, this year’s hilarious action-comedy <em>Thelma </em>is passing the mantle off to 94-year-old Oscar-nominated actress June Squibb. </p>
<p id="6MRk2o"><em>Thelma</em> is the first feature film from director Josh Margolin. It’s about a 92-year-old woman named Thelma who loses $10,000 to a scammer pretending to be her grandson. But instead of taking the scam lying down, she jumps on her scooter, recruits a friend, and sets off on a quest to take back her money.</p>
<p id="7GS3a5">In an interview with Polygon, Margolin explained that the story is based on a real incident that happened to his own grandma — though thankfully, in real life, she didn’t actually send the money to her would-be scammers. But if that premise sounds familiar, Margolin is very aware of the happy accident of his movie’s proximity to Jason Statham’s recently released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24031441/beekeeper-review-jason-statham-movie"><em>The Beekeeper</em></a>, which was also about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24035803/beekeeper-david-ayer-interview-jason-statham">a phone scammer getting a very different kind of comeuppance</a>. </p>
<p id="zZMqML">“It was so funny to see that trailer,” Margolin says with a laugh. “I was like, <em>Oh my god</em>, <em>we’re a little bit like</em> The Beekeeper. I definitely watched it because I was like, <em>I have to see this</em>. And it was wild and crazy and fun. [...] I’m glad we can continue the grand tradition that <em>The Beekeeper</em> started.”</p>

<p id="KErOUm">But while <em>Thelma </em>might be significantly less violent than <em>The Beekeeper</em>, it’s even funnier and no less thrilling. For Margolin, one of the most important parts of the movie was translating the language of action filmmaking to this less-than-traditional cast, which also includes the late Richard Roundtree (<em>Shaft</em>) in a fantastic and fun performance. That means high-speed chases on scooters, fistfights at more manageable speeds, and high-tension heists with hearing aids. </p>
<p id="pjdPFz">“I’m a big fan of action movies. I always have been,” says Margolin. “The idea [was] trying to tell the story of my grandma, and this ode to her and celebrate her grit and tenacity, [using] those tropes and ideas and shrinking them down to an everyday scope and scale, but treating them with real stakes.” </p>
<p id="DQEBL6">Margolin says he wanted to find a way to dramatize what he calls the everyday heroism of “moving through the world as you get older and things get harder, and smaller things present more danger.”</p>
<p id="6J8ouR">Of course, slowed-down action scenes with older people in chases and fights could easily come off as parody — or worse, poking fun at its terrific cast of older actors. But Margolin brilliantly walks the line of laughing with our characters rather than laughing at them. They’re the stars of a true action movie here, not the butt of a joke.</p>
<p id="ytbSyL">“It’s so easy for anything sending up those tropes or referencing them to feel like parody, and especially stuff with older characters,” Margolin says. “Something that me and my producers were very cognizant of protecting was the tone, and trying to make sure that all of the action, all of the tension, all of the fun was always born out of a sincere and earnest care for what was happening. </p>

<p id="yQ51BS">“We never wanted it to feel like it was punching down or poking fun. We wanted it to be funny in a way that felt like we’re along for the ride.”</p>
<p id="CFm2UD">Part of that earnestness also comes from Margolin’s own favorite action movies. He says he prefers an actioner that “treats its stakes sincerely, isn’t just winky and referential, but action that’s fun and surprising and tense and just treats things with a certain sincerity. Obviously, the Mission: Impossible movies are a big influence on [the movie]. Watching <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23780290/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-supercut-running">Tom Cruise hurl himself at various moving objects</a> for our entertainment is a source of inspiration for [our] ethos.” </p>
<p id="dFhwZ2">Thelma watches a Mission: Impossible film during the movie, and her Tom Cruise inspiration is not just there in spirit, but in the text itself. After she gets scammed, it’s seeing Cruise’s face on a magazine that inspires Thelma to take justice into her own hands. But that kind of sincerity wouldn’t work without <em>Thelma</em>’s terrific and committed performances, particularly from Squibb and Roundtree. Both actors are terrifically funny, and Roundtree’s charm gives the movie a tremendous amount of heart. For her part, Margolin says Squibb was adamant about owning the Tom Cruise mantle and doing as many stunts as she could herself. </p>
<div id="9DbRcc"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFAFsDEM0j4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1F2G2B">“She did!” Margolin laughs. “And increasingly so as we went on, because we were pretty nervous and careful and conservative about all those things. With the help of our really awesome stunt team, as the shoot progressed and she got more comfortable with the scooter and things like getting onto the bed and rolling, we sort of developed a shorthand for what she was or wasn’t game for. It was really cool. She used to be a dancer; she was doing Pilates pretty rigorously in the lead-up to the movie. There’s a lot of physical prowess to her as a performer, and it was really cool to see her tap into that, even at this moment in her life, and use that in the movie.” </p>
<p id="hvvEs1">It’s rare that a summer action movie also happens to be one of the funniest and sweetest movies of the year, but <em>Thelma </em>manages to pull it off. So if you’re feeling the lack of Tom Cruise at movie theaters this year, just remember that <em>Thelma </em>and June Squibb are there, carrying the torch in his honor. </p>
<p id="9XnHt6"><small><em>Thelma </em></small><small>will be released in theaters on June 21.</small></p>

<p data-characters="153" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC is the latest special challenge in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team. It’s another with lower requirements and a single, easy task. </p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">For tonight’s content, EA Sports has decided to release a TOTS item from the NWSL. She can be a great fit with other items like Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith, who are available in different packs. To get this card, you’ll have to complete Huerta’s SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-sofia-huerta-tots-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">The latest TOTS SBC is extremely easy to complete, as it has only one task. The solo task does have certain conditions, but this is a perfect challenge to complete for beginners. </p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Sofia Huerta</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min. Team Rating: 83</li> </ul> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">You’ll need to use at least one TOTS or TOTW item, and my suggestion will be to use the latter. The 83+ TOTW Pick SBC allows players to craft as many items as they want in exchange for lower-rated fodder. TOTS items have higher ratings, and are far more expensive to get. It’s best to save them for SBCs that require higher-rated squads. </p>

This will help you to preserve in-game resources, or use them in other content like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">Henrikh Mkhitaryan TOTS SBC</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Sofia Huerta</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"> <li>Melvine Malard 82</li> <li>Jadon Sancho 82</li> <li>Leah Galton 83</li> <li>Alana Cook 82</li> <li>Klara Buhl 83</li> <li>Mathilde Bourdieu 83</li> <li>Joao Palhinha 83</li> <li>Sophie Schmidt 83</li> <li>Gaetan Laborde 82</li> <li>Jorginho 83</li> <li>Nicolas Otamendi TOTW 84</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC certainly offers a lot of value in <em>EA FC 24</em>, and the 92-rated RB item can play in several positions. It also has the Whipped Cross+ and Intercept+ playstyles, along with H/H work-rates. This item, in many ways, is a cheap beast like last evening’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-albert-gudmundsson-serie-a-tots-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS card</a>. </p>

            <p>Tavern Keeper has been kicking around for a good number of years now, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-dev-tycoon">Game Dev Tycoon</a> developers Greenheart Games polished up their charming mixture of Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy bartending with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/theme-hospital">Theme Hospital</a>-style sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">management</a>. Almost a decade from Game Dev Tycoon’s release, Tavern Keeper is now finally approaching its early access release later this year.</p>

<p>Tavern Keeper pops you in the beer-splashed boots of publican orcs, who as you’d imagine must juggle keeping locals happy with the business of running and expanding their enterprise. That includes laying out the tavern’s rooms themselves, filling them with furniture, ensuring that stock levels are kept up and hiring more staff - who you must also keep happy - to help you out with cooking meals (such as flambé swamp rat), cleaning and meeting the demands of patrons.</p>
<p>The game’s campaign throws up both some fun simulation-sandbox events - whether fires caused by errant fireplace ashes or an outbreak of the plague - and more crafted dialogue options with characters that help form its story. The simulation layer certainly seems to run deep, taking into account everything from the brightness of your torchlit cabin and filth levels to the unique environments and local cultures surrounding taverns in different locations. If you prefer to just decorate, there’ll be a design mode too.</p>
<p>Tavern Keeper is somewhat unbelievably only Greenheart Games’ second game after Game Dev Tycoon, which came out way back in 2012 and won over folks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-game-dev-tycoon">including Nate</a> (RPS in Peace) for its charming and comical trip through the history of video game development.</p>

<p>Tavern Keeper looks to keep that same charm and lightheartedness at its core, going by the first gameplay trailer, which immediately had me dreaming up my ideal pub <a href="https://youtu.be/6tVIabRBKmY">like that episode of Peep Show</a>. (You can even christen your fantasy tavern, though I’d personally recommend not following the naming conventions of Super Hans.) If there’s higher praise than that, I can’t think of it.</p>
<p>Tavern Keeper will pull its first pints in Q4 this year, when it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/">throws open its doors on Steam early access</a>. See you at the bar.</p>

However, it hasn’t quite lived up to that since relaunching on May 28. </p><h2 id="h27458"><a id=""></a>Poor performance and laggy combat</h2><p>I hopped into <em>MultiVersus </em>last night, excited to check out the game’s new character, <em>Friday the 13th </em>killer Jason Voorhees. Playing on an Xbox Series X, I encountered frame dips and lag during the opening tutorial sequence featuring Shaggy and Batman. After that, I ran into lag while just using the game’s menus and had performance issues during AI fights. Online, I had two matches disconnect and had other matches slow down to a crawl due to a combination of lag and performance dips. It all felt bad! </p><p>Looking online, it seems I’m not alone. I’ve found countless clips from players complaining about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ChrisHenares/status/1795782840551874837&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ChrisHenares/status/1795782840551874837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poor performance on different platforms</a></span>.

During the game’s extended beta, the option to use any character in local play offered a fun way for folks to test out characters before buying them, and provided tournament organizers a way to let everyone have access to the full roster without having to fork over a ton of money. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1795629888109768821&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1795629888109768821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MultiVersus </em>game director Tony Huynh suggested on Twitter</a></span> that the team was looking into this specific issue, but it’s still unclear if characters will be unlocked in local play in the future. </p><p>This isn’t the only negative change made to the full game after its open beta. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As documented on the <em>MultiVersus </em>subreddit</a></span>, a lot has changed in the full release of the online fighter, and most of it sounds like a big step back.</p><p>For example, leaderboards at the end of matches have been removed, there is no longer an advanced tutorial mode, cheaper characters have had their in-game prices raised, battle pass XP can only be earned from challenges and not from playing matches, and you can’t remove the red/blue team color effects on characters seen in 2 v 2 matches. Players are also unhappy with how much slower and clunkier the game feels compared to the beta. </p><p>The overall vibes online after the game’s first full day back seem mostly negative, though a lot of fans are hopeful that the developers can fix some of these problems and make gameplay feel more like it did during the extended beta in 2022. Hopefully, WB won’t have to kill the game for another 10 months or so to fix this stuff.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of our favorite video game franchises exist in a sad state of limbo. It’s only natural that after decades of companies making games and trying to earn the most money from them, that some good titles would fall through the cracks, never to become a big, annualized franchise like <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>Madden</em>.<br></p><p>But what are some of those games that deserve another shot? We’ve rounded up a handful of dead franchises we want to see spring back to life.</p></div></div><div><p>The maddening thing about the death of the <em>Sly Cooper </em>franchise is Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 2 platformer series was done at one point and we could have just left it alone and not ended up in this mess. The trilogy ended on a high note in 2005 with <em>Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves.</em> Then, Sanzaru Games, who worked on the PlayStation 3 remasters, pitched a fourth game to Sony all about traveling to the titular thief’s ancestors’ times and pulling off heists across the timeline. <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em> was a solid new entry that managed to modernize the formula while staying true to its roots.. The problem was: It ended on a devastating cliffhanger. Sly was trapped in the timeline and has been stuck in Ancient Egypt ever since.</p><p>Sanzaru planned to wrap things up with a DLC set in Egypt, but Sony <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/sly-cooper-egypt-dlc-cancelled-give-me-sly-5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/sly-cooper-egypt-dlc-cancelled-give-me-sly-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to greenlight it</a></span>. Since then, there has been a planned film and TV series, neither of which got off the ground. Sucker Punch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-infamous-sly-cooper-sequel-release-date-1849135478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-infamous-sly-cooper-sequel-release-date-1849135478">confirmed in 2022</a></span> that there were no plans to revive the series, so Sony damned one of its PS2 mascots to a life trapped in a different time. They’ll <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467">slap him on promotional material</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gear.playstation.com/Product/1535734-Sly_Cooper_20th_Anniversary_Poster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gear.playstation.com/Product/1535734-Sly_Cooper_20th_Anniversary_Poster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">throw a party for his 20th anniversary</a></span>, but won’t save him. Give me <em>Sly Cooper 5 </em>Sony. Or make an animated short or even just an official art piece of him escaping Ancient Egypt. Save him! — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>Sure, there was an arcade <em>Bionic Commando</em>, but let me be clear: The <em>Bionic Commando </em>everyone loved was the face-meltingly awesome NES game, the one in which you fire a bazooka right at Hitler’s face and watch it explode. (If you’re unfamiliar with this classic moment in video game history, see the above video.) Violence like that may be fairly par for the course today, but in 1988, it was totally metal. This was a game that went all out. Adding to its sheer, unrelenting awesomeness were all the incredible tunes and, most of all, the thrilling movement of our titular hero. There are still few games that have ever felt so satisfying to control, as you master the timing of your swings to swoop through the air and infiltrate enemy strongholds like the elite soldier you are. Yes, it got a sequel of sorts with the 2009 game of the same name, but it just didn’t deliver on the same level or make the most of the signature grappling mechanic. Rather than a new big-budget 3D game, I’d love to see a fresh take on the classic side-scrolling (and side-swinging) action. Let some inventive, crackerjack indie studio take the reins and see what they can do with that delicious movement. If <em>Prince of Persia </em>can get a sweet new 2D game in 2024, then I think <em>Bionic Commando </em>can get one, too. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Capcom’s <em>Onimusha </em>games carved out a distinct niche for themselves in the gaming landscape of the early 2000s. Superficially, they were reminiscent of the <em>Resident Evil </em>games with their pre-rendered backgrounds, fixed camera angles, and environmental puzzles, but they also fused sword-swinging samurai action with elements of demonic horror, giving them a vibe all their own. (At one point they even pulled French actor Jean “<em>The Professional</em>” Reno <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/o-aAPg_Ajjk?si=EtBxIb6mGazhKpGa&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/o-aAPg_Ajjk?si=EtBxIb6mGazhKpGa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into the proceedings</a></span>, and I gotta say, I respect the sheer audacity.) With the recent success of the TV miniseries <em>Shogūn </em>and more high-profile games than ever before being set in the era of samurai, I think the time is ripe for a new <em>Onimusha </em>game as well. Give us a tightly focused 8-10 hour game along the lines of Capcom’s recent <em>Resident Evil </em>remakes that lets us slash demons and vanquish evil without going the route of colossal open-world adventures like <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>or the forthcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em>. </em>— <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Watching that intro movie above still gets me pumped for this moody 1998 role-playing game which<em> </em>showed that developer Square was willing to take big swings and depart from the norm with a modern-day, real-world setting and unconventional combat. <em>Parasite Eve </em>is great for many reasons, not least because of its outstanding use of New York City. Yes, absolutely bananas stuff happens in the game, and at least one key character crosses the line into stereotypical caricature at times, but New York itself feels authentic and layered here, as your journey takes you from high-society operas to museums to streets where the downtrodden reside. Protagonist Aya Brea’s quest is both thrilling and haunting, with explosive moments right out of an action movie and others that suggest low-budget body horror, all playing out in a near-empty city in that strange, liminal time between Christmas and New Year’s.</p><p><em>Parasite Eve </em>got a few follow-ups but neither was as original or memorable as the first. I’d love to see Square Enix bring the series back today and try to create something that matches the desolate, moody tone of the 1998 classic, while also doing something fresh and original with the combat to create a greater fusion of role-playing and survival horror action. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p>Full disclosure: I really liked <em>L.A. Noire</em>, but I’m also someone who has a weakness for the style and atmosphere of the period, and for stories of hard-boiled detectives operating within the all-consuming corruption of the L.A.P.D. (<em>L.A. Confidential </em>is one of my favorite films of all time.) I recognize that there were things about this game that felt unsatisfying to many players, and that’s a big part of why I think the concept of a detective game set in 1940s L.A. deserves another chance. There’s still so much potential in it! I think there must be tons of people out there who would love to play a great noir crime saga that sees you investigating murders, chatting up dames in smoky jazz clubs, and finding yourself in way over your head as the trail of evidence leads you to run up against some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the city. Let’s give it another shot, with clearer, more refined interrogation mechanics and character models that don’t inhabit the uncanny valley quite so blatantly. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Look, I take no pleasure in writing about <em>Titanfall</em> here in this list of d e a d franchises. But ya’ll, we’re nearing 10 years since <em>Titanfall 2</em> came out and, you know, sometimes ya just gotta accept that something you really want in life just ain’t gonna happen for you.</p><p>I get it, in a world of repetitive, mindless shooters, <em>Titanfall</em> was (and is) something special. On paper, it could’ve easily been Just-Another-Shooter™ stock with gimmicks to try and stay unique, but its wall-running and titular Titans worked exceedingly well. The guns felt good to shoot and reload, and the extra jump kit abilities allowed for unique traversal and combat scenarios rarely seen elsewhere. Add in the Titans, and <em>Titanfall</em> skirmishes were dynamic and explosive. True, some of that still lives on in developer Respawn’s <em>Apex Legends</em>, but you and I both know that’s no substitute (though you should give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-can-t-stop-playing-this-titanfall-f-e-a-r-killzone-d-1850772277&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-can-t-stop-playing-this-titanfall-f-e-a-r-killzone-d-1850772277">indie title <em>Sprawl</em></a></span>, easily one of my favorite games of 2023, a shot as it contains some engaging wall-running action and so much more).</p><p>It would be wonderful to see another <em>Titanfall</em>, complete with a great single-player experience that takes everything learned from the first and second games, and <em>Apex Legends</em>, and delivers an energetic, gravity defying shooter punctuated by epic and engaging gameplay with mechs. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>NanaOn-Sha’s rhythm game about a rapping dog may not be the most complex take on the genre, but the <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>series is still incredibly distinct. Parappa is a regular teenager dealing with regular teenage problems, but he gets through them by rapping alongside different teachers. A dog rapping alongside a sentient onion as he learns karate or taking his driver’s test with a moose shouldn’t work, but <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>pulls off each of these scenarios with style, an incredible soundtrack, and a deceptively simple rhythm game with hidden perks for improvising. The sequel doesn’t have as many bops, but the jump to the PlayStation 2 let the team flex and create cooler music videos to accompany each song.</p><p>It’s all very silly, and even though there hasn’t been a new game in over 20 years, the main character and his silly little songs have persisted over the decades through merchandise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/discover/step-on-the-gas-meme&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/step-on-the-gas-meme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and memes</a></span>. A <em>Parappa the Rapper 3 </em>makes perfect sense as something Sony could drop on PlayStation Network for relatively cheap. This is the exact kind of project that digital storefronts are made for. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>One of the all-time best feelings I’ve felt in any game I’ve ever played is free-falling in <em>Gravity Rush</em>. The series’ protagonist Kat is one of the most gorgeously drawn and animated characters I’ve ever seen, and she is never more expressive than when she is dropping from the sky. <em>Gravity Rush</em>’s camera swings anywhere you want it to go, allowing you to frame Kat’s free fall however you please. You can follow her from afar, ascribe to cinematography’s rule-of-thirds and frame her dramatically, or stick the camera comically close to her. Kat’s hair and clothes catch in the wind, which rushes past her as she twirls through the air and spreads her arms with reckless abandon. She’s like a little kid realizing that she can fly for the first time.<br></p><p><em>Gravity Rush </em>had a lot going for it, like its gravity-defying combat, its beautifully drawn world which lifted design elements from classical French architecture, and its charming cast of characters, but its biggest draw is that it’s simply <em>the </em>most liberating game. Tons of games allow me to do far more than <em>Gravity Rush</em>, but few of them have ever matched the high of being suspended above a town and then just letting it go. There’s something intoxicating and empowering about Kat’s ability to reduce the world to a blur around her as she zips past it all. It’s just best-in-class movement, and it’s criminal that Japan Studio and Team Gravity aren’t around to give us more astounding worlds to float around in. — <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>Putting Banjo and Kazooie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/surprise-banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-smash-ultimate-1835415834&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-smash-ultimate-1835415834">in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a></span> was a no-brainer, but I’m always wary of companies cashing in on a beloved franchise with zero commitment. It’s been 16 years since the last <em>Banjo-Kazooie </em>game, and even that wasn’t the platformer fans have been asking for since <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> in 2000. The company is busy with <em>Sea of Thieves </em>these days, but if Microsoft has enough money to acquire a bunch of studios then promptly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">gut them</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685">shut them down</a></span>, it could instead nurture the IP and talent it already has. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Speaking of Rare, <em>Viva Piñata</em> is a perfect video game. You’re telling me a garden simulator in which you build a home for living piñatas that reproduce by dancing doesn’t sound like the tightest shit you’ve ever played? Then maybe you should boot up the <em>Rare Replay</em> collection and see for yourself. <em>Viva Piñata</em> should have been huge. The games were great (well, with the exception of the <em>Party Animals </em>mini-game compilation) and Microsoft made it a multimedia franchise, so we got a pretty funny television show out of the deal that lasted a few years. But we tragically haven’t seen anything out of the series since 2008’s <em>Trouble in Paradise </em>and <em>Pocket Paradise</em> launched on the Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS, respectively. Unfortunately, I can’t imagine a version of <em>Viva Piñata </em>on modern platforms that doesn’t succumb to some insufferable live-service bullshit like microtransactions to buy in-game supplies or your character becoming “tired” if you don’t pay for an extension that day. But I can dream of another trip to Piñata Island in 4K. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>How do we live in a timeline with hyper advanced ray-tracing graphics technology and no new <em>Splinter Cell</em> game? For that matter, how is that the case and we don’t have a major AAA stealth title that takes advantage of this tech? Or just one that exists period? (Sorry, I don’t count <em>Hitman</em>. Cry about it).</p><p>What little I had of a happy childhood was often spent between <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>and <em>Splinter Cell</em>. I came to <em>MGS</em> for the great gameplay and mind-bending story. But <em>Splinter Cell</em> was the more sophisticated stealth experience that got better with each game (until around <em>Double Agent</em> where things got kinda meh). Light, sound, precision movement through hostile territory, and, of course, impressive graphics that weren’t just flashy ways to show off your hardware, but were actually dynamic parts of the stealth action.</p><p>Gaming tech has only gotten more sophisticated since the last <em>Splinter Cell </em>games. I usually don’t beg for bleeding edge tech, but a new <em>Splinter Cell</em> (which apparently, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-sam-fisher-free-game-1849798206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-sam-fisher-free-game-1849798206">maybe, might, sorta happen</a></span>—and god help Ubisoft if Michael Ironside isn’t voicing Sam again), would have me salivating over how advanced lighting and rendering techniques could make the game look and feel amazing to play. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>The first <em>Killzone </em>came along when I was far too young to reasonably play it, but the second struck at just the right time. Touted as PlayStation’s next big thing, the visually sumptuous shooter represented the very cutting edge of technology, and I took that bait <em>hard</em>. <em>Killzone 2 </em>was the game that taught me about the importance of visual fidelity and it just so happened to be an incredibly weighty and hardcore multiplayer FPS as well. I was forged in the insanity of <em>Resistance</em>’s all-out wars and <em>Killzone’s </em>tight-knit and punchy encounters.<br></p><p><em>Killzone </em>was probably ultimately brought down by its ridiculously high production values, but some of the stuff in that game is still top tier all these years later. The brutal melee executions of <em>Killzone 3 </em>instilled a love of animation in my friends and I that we still haven’t shaken. I can still recall the satisfying pound of the shotgun in <em>Killzone 2, </em>and the brain-tickling tick that confirmed a kill in it and <em>Killzone: Mercenary</em>. Speaking of, <em>Mercenary </em>is one of the finest adaptations of a series to a handheld platform that I’ve ever played, and a criminally overlooked game in that series and on the PS Vita.</p><p>I’m the first person to often bemoan something that feels overproduced, but if I may be self-indulgent, I’d love to see another shot at <em>Killzone </em>sometime in the future. — <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>My first <em>Deus Ex</em> was its first sequel: <em>Invisible War</em>. It’s an entry that’s not terribly popular with enthusiasts of the original game, but it remains a competent immersive sim that likely was my personal introduction to the genre and franchise.<br></p><p>I would eventually go on to play the original (though not to completion, which I really ought to do something about) and came to understand why it was so memorable. Its thick atmosphere of enigmatic conspiracy theories and gripping, unpredictable gameplay of interlocking systems—finding keys and codes for rooms, staying out of sight of enemy patrols—was a perpetual motion machine of espionage and high-concept science fiction themes that I just couldn’t get enough of.</p><p>But while Adam Jensen’s pair of imsim adventures were solid, they felt like they were leading to an eventual third release that’d combine the best of <em>Human Revolution </em>and <em>Mankind Divided</em> into an excellent, moody cyberpunk-esque adventure to save the world. Sadly, that’s unlikely to happen. Sure, there was a solid eight-year gap between <em>Invisible War</em> and <em>Human Revolution</em>, and we’re right around eight years since the last game, <em>Mankind Divided</em>. But tumultuous brand management seems destined to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201">keep us from another <em>Deus Ex</em> title</a></span> for some time yet. Perhaps forever.</p><p>It’s a shame because there’s just nothing like <em>Deus Ex</em> and the world is starved of great immersive sim titles. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>My friends used to make fun of me because I liked <em>Red Faction</em>. I don’t know why. But I do know that their distaste of this futuristic, working-class revolution-themed shooter franchise was their loss. To be fair, my memories of the earlier days of this franchise are a little fuzzy as I get on in years, but the more recent <em>Red Faction: Guerilla</em> remains a satisfying game to play. Sure, it falls victim to the condition of having a large open world that is a little too empty, but the destructive physics systems which detail intricate and satisfying collapses of buildings and objects never gets old.</p><p>And hey, with a game that is about literally <em>smashing</em> the status quo to build a better future, there’s a narrative cohesion between the game’s systems that makes the whole experience just more entertaining and immersive. It’s also been 15 years since <em>Guerilla</em>’s release date (it was re-Mars-tered six years ago), and 13 years since it’s so-so follow-up <em>Armageddon</em>, so it’s safe to say this one’s probably gonna continue sleeping for the unforeseeable future. Which, like many other dead franchises, is a shame given how computing power has grown since <em>Guerilla</em> arrived on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 release a decade-and-a-half ago. I mean, look at stuff like <em>Teardown</em>!</p><p>Our gaming machines are so much more powerful these days and I long for more wildly destructive physics simulations while uniting the Martian working class. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>Hello, it’s me, your resident PlayStation FPS freak. At the outset of the PS3 era, Sony had two major franchises fostering entirely unique shooter experiences. One of them was viscerally realistic and grim <em>Killzone</em>, and the other was my beloved off-kilter <em>Resistance</em>. I didn’t play the original, but one of my older cousins had picked up the second title on PS3. If you ask most folks my age, the formative FPS title of their youth is probably a <em>Call of Duty </em>title, specifically <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. While I’ve certainly got room in my heart for that legendary game, my love for the genre is entirely predicated on <em>Resistance 2</em> and the sleepless nights me and my cousin spent duking it out in its massive 60-player Skirmish matches with one of the greatest armories of any FPS title.<br></p><p><em>Resistance </em>was simply everything to me. It was massive and it was weird as hell. In the brief time that we had with the series, it ran the gamut of tones. The bookends of the trilogy were bleak post-apocalyptic shooters (<em>Resistance 3 </em>is particularly great), but the middle installment was cartoonish and all over the place. Nathan Hale and Joseph Capelli, the trilogy’s protagonists, could not be a greater representation of the series’ unique schisms across entries. <em>Resistance</em> was, above all else, fun as hell though, and it’s where I got my sea legs. <em>Resistance</em>’s weaponry, which took inspiration from Insomniac’s main series, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, also remains burned into my brain. The Augur remains one of my favorite weapons in any game and I learned trigger discipline while carefully placing tags on enemies and shooting them from around corners with the Bullseye.</p><p>Letting the series go has been one of the hardest pills to swallow over the last decade, especially because <em>Resistance 3 </em>really felt like it finally settled on a tone and formula that worked. Sure, it also brought the story to a pretty natural close, but there were enough interesting threads, especially as far as the origins of the invading alien species known as the Chimera, to expand upon the series and turn it into a pulpy sci-fi saga. I miss you all the time, <em>Resistance</em>. — <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>In the ‘90s, I didn’t play <em>Syphon Filter</em> nearly as much as I played another sneaky, espionage title: <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>. And you know, for good reason. <em>MGS</em> was just more on my wavelength, but I enjoyed cheering <em>Syphon Filter</em> on from the sides. It didn’t seem to have the narrative-heavy experience I craved, and wasn’t as sneaky, but to me that always made me more curious about it.</p><p>It’s been some years since I gave the first <em>Syphon Filter</em> a try, and I’m feeling a return to it is necessary for me. But I’m also kinda bummed that the franchise doesn’t exist prominently in Sony’s catalog. As has been exhibited with <em>Resistance</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, and <em>SOCOM</em>, PlayStation has been home to off-beat shooters that I wish the company would maintain a presence in instead of just prestige AAA titles of the kind they mostly invest their money in.</p><p>And in a world without an active <em>Splinter Cell</em>, and whilst <em>MGS</em> still wrestles with its post-Kojima identity crisis, what an opportunity for <em>Syphon Filter</em> to make a return with excellent espionage action, tense shootouts, world-ending consequences, and insurmountable odds that you’re expected to sneak, shoot, and survive your way through.</p><p>Gabe, I never got to know ya like Snake and Sam, but damn if right now isn’t a perfect time for a new espionage thriller from this classic franchise, I don’t know when is. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>Looking back on <em>Viewtiful Joe</em>, Capcom’s short-lived side-scrolling beat-em-up, I was surprised at just how quickly the series came and went. The first game in 2003 was part of the “Capcom Five,” a five-game initiative from the company to bring original games to the GameCube (it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise-betrayal-5806800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise-betrayal-5806800">a whole drama back in the day</a></span>). The sequel solidified <em>Viewtiful Joe </em>as a series the next year, but the spin-offs that followed in 2005 failed to set the world on fire. In the years since, creator Hideki Kamiya (who went on to co-found <em>Bayonetta </em>developer PlatinumGames) has said he would like to return to the franchise, whether that be with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-wants-viewtiful-joe-dmc-remake-dante-x-bayonneta-crossover/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-wants-viewtiful-joe-dmc-remake-dante-x-bayonneta-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remake of the first game</a></span> or with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/hideki_kamiya_would_love_to_release_viewtiful_joe_3_and_finish_that_trilogy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/hideki_kamiya_would_love_to_release_viewtiful_joe_3_and_finish_that_trilogy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third entry</a></span>. For now, we’ll just have to be content with the title character being playable in <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>…oh wait, they took him out in <em>Infinite</em>. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>For a time during the PS2 era, the <em>SSX </em>games offered up awesome extreme sports action, letting you do sick snowboarding tricks while listening to “It’s Tricky” by Run-D.M.C. It’s been over a decade since EA tried to bring the franchise back with the more realistic and well-reviewed <em>SSX </em>for Xbox 360 and PS3. Even though that last entry sold well, it seems EA isn’t convinced the world wants zany snowboarding action anymore. What a shame.</p><p>While I’m not sure a big AAA <em>SSX </em>game would sell in 2024 or is the right move, I don’t think that’s the direction the franchise should take. Instead, look to <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em> and its recent remake of the first two games as inspiration. I bet there are a few studios out there that would be willing to remaster or remake the first three games into one rad package for modern consoles. Or just make a new <em>SSX </em>that is free-to-play and borrows its economy from <em>Fortnite</em>. I don’t know, just bring it back in some form EA. Let me do a sick 2160 off a snowy cliff again as Eddie. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Some franchises on this list feel like they were never given a chance to become something big and successful. Then you have a series like Capcom’s <em>Dead Rising</em>, which feels like it’s been given a few chances and yet has exploded in the way you’d think a game about killing thousands of zombies would have. I think the problem isn’t just zombie fatigue, but that <em>Dead Rising</em> as a franchise is extremely inconsistent. Beyond the crowds of zombies and the ability to kill them all using anything you find, the games have changed a lot and that’s made it hard to develop a fanbase.</p><p>If I were to give Capcom some advice, it would be to look back at that first game and try again. But this time, embrace the harder and less flexible format of<em> Dead Rising 1</em>. People love that shit nowadays. Games like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>show that players crave challenges and difficulty in a way that maybe they didn’t back in the early days of the 360. And leverage the newer consoles to make the biggest zombie game yet, too. Imagine an open-world zombie game 10x bigger than any previous <em>Dead Rising</em>, but as hard and unforgiving as <em>Dark Souls</em>. That shit would sell like hotcakes! — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Sure, <em>technically </em>Valve has sort of (kind of) continued to update <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, sometimes with the help of fans, but I still consider this franchise dead, like most other Valve franchises. Which is sad, because <em>Left 4 Dead</em> ruled.</p><p>Valve did what Valve does best, and crafted two online co-op shooters that were perfect to play. Shooting down hordes of zombies with friends or hunting down other players as a special infected was a blast. Even if you played online without a mic, Valve built <em>L4D1 </em>and its sequel in a way that made it totally possible to play without talking. (Though chatting did help!) It also crafted characters, like Zoey and Ellis, that people cared about. I still think about Bill sacrificing himself in the final <em>L4D1 </em>DLC to this day. Hopefully, someone else at Valve is also thinking about <em>Left 4 Dead</em>. I hope so, because this franchise and its fans deserve a third entry. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Okay, hold on. Come back. What if I told you Sony’s attempt at a <em>Smash Bros. </em>crossover fighter ruled, actually? Yes, it didn’t take off the way Nintendo’s brawler has, but it had some cool ideas, and in between the characters clearly added to advertise an upcoming project, the roster is pretty fucking solid. But even if you think <em>PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale </em>was a garbage copycat, we’re not here to retread the mistakes of the past. We’re envisioning a better future.</p><p>In the 12 years since <em>PlayStation All-Stars </em>launched on PS3 and Vita, Sony has gathered a lot of new, much-loved characters like Astro, Ellie, and Aloy to add to the roster, and has more cultural cache than they did during the PS3 generation to negotiate better guest characters. What if we got actual Dante instead of the <em>DmC: Devil May Cry </em>one because Capcom was clearly trying to make the game an ad for its upcoming game? Sony could secure egregious omissions like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro to properly represent the PlayStation brand’s history. I just want them to get a second chance to do it right, and PlayStation’s certainly in a better place to do that now than they were when the PlayStation 3 was in last place. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was a few days ago that news surfaced regarding a potential Fallout x Call of Duty crossover bundle. Given the recent success of the Fallout TV show and the ongoing effort by Activision Blizzard’s studios to collaborate with every brand in the pop culture market, it seemed like it was only a matter of time before it surfaced for real.</p>



<p>Dataminers recently leaked an image online showing the ‘Fallout Vault Dweller Tracker Pack’. This pack looks as though it’ll contain a blueprint for the M4 and M16, and ‘Vault Suit’ skins for Gaz, Soap, Price, and Ghost.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-apocalyptic-w-or-l">Apocalyptic W or L?</h2>



<p>Many were expecting something a little more substantial from this crossover, given how overwhelmingly successful the Fallout TV show has been since it was released on April 9. For instance, there’s an upcoming Fallout collaboration in Fortnite that’s already looking infinitely better than this leaked COD crossover.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1795854134223970702/photo/1">the leaked art</a> that was found by dataminers, Modern Warfare’s core squad – Ghost, Soap, Price, and Gaz – have donned iconic Vault Suits modelled on those found in the new TV show. They’ve also got some Vault-Tec branded weapons – but that seems to be the full extent of the Fallout Vault Dweller Tracer Pack. It’s a safe assumption that there will also be the usual charms, emblems, and player cards associated with bundles, and the tracer pack element will most likely replicate the laser-focused weapons commonly found across the Fallout universe.</p>



<p>Will you be investing in the Fallout Vault Dweller Tracer Pack in Call of Duty?</p>

<p>Sony has taken down an interview with Naughty Dog Studio Head Neil Druckmann (<em>Uncharted</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>) that the company now says contains "several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values." The surprising move comes after Druckmann took the extreme measure of publicly questioning a portion of the PR interview by <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837">posting a lengthy transcript</a> that conflicted with the heavily edited version Sony posted online.</p>
<p>The odd media saga began last Thursday, when Sony published the interview (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240525155202/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">archive here</a>) under the heading "The Evolution of Storytelling Across Mediums." The piece was part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/">the Creative Entertainment Vision section</a> of Sony's corporate site, a PR-driven concept exploring how Sony will "seamlessly connect multi-layered worlds where physical and virtual realities overlap to deliver limitless Kanto—through creativity and technology—working with creators." Whatever that means.</p>
<p>Druckmann's short interview started <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423">attracting</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann-says-ai-will-revolutionize-how-content-is-being-created">attention</a> almost immediately, primarily due to Druckmann's apparent promotion of using AI tools in game development. Such tools "will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities," Druckmann is quoted as saying. "AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address."</p>
<h2>Not so fast...</h2>
<p>By Friday, though, Druckmann ended a months-long drought of social media posting by <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408">noting</a> that, in at least one case, the words posted by Sony were "not quite what I said. In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost."</p>
<p>As evidence, Druckmann posted this "rambling" 457-word response to a question about a "personal vision or dream project" he hoped to create:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, I've been very lucky, in that I've already had that. I got the chance to make several of my dream projects. I am working on a new one right now. And it's maybe the most excited I've been for a project yet. I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me.</p>
<p>And I guess in general, there is something happening now that I think is very cool. Which is there's a new appreciation for gaming that I've never seen before. Like when I was growing up, gaming was more of a kid's thing. Now it's clearly for everyone. But it's like, if you're a gamer, you know about the potential of games, and non-gamers, they don't really know what they're missing out on.</p>
<p>But my hope was, when we made <em>The Last of Us</em> as a TV show that we could change that. And why I became so involved with it. I wanted so badly for it to be good, because I wanted this to happen, which is like someone who will watch the show and really like it. And fall in love with those characters the way that we have fallen in love with those characters and their story. And then realize at the end, "Wait, that's based on a video game?" and then go and check out the game and just see the wealth of narratives and everything that's happening in games.</p>
<p>So now I feel like there's kind of a spotlight on gaming. And you know, <em>Fallout</em> just came out. And that's a big success for Amazon. And I find that really exciting. Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows, but I think it just kind of opens the eyes of a bunch of people that just weren't aware of the kind of experiences that exist in games. I think right now we've hit a tipping point where it's about to take off where people realize, "Oh my God, there's all these incredible moving experiences in games!"</p>
<p>So, I'm not only excited for this game that we're making—and it's, it's something really fresh for us—but I'm also excited to see how the world reacts to it. Because of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and the success of the show, people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next. I'm very excited to see what the reaction for this thing will be—and l've already said too much about it. I'll stop there. So, you're asking me for my dream projects. I've been very lucky to have worked on my favorite games with incredible collaborators and I'm very thankful for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>For reference, here is the 127-word summary of that answer posted by Sony:</p>                                            
                                                        
<blockquote><p>I've been lucky to work on several dream projects and am currently excited about a new one, which is perhaps the most thrilling yet. There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up. This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with <em>The Last of Us</em>, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of <em>The Last of Us</em>, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the gist of Druckmann's original answer is more or less preserved, the condensed version loses a lot of the specific details and flavor Druckmann highlighted in his answer. The edited version also inserts some key phrases and ideas that Druckmann didn't use at all, such as his supposed hope that his new project "could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p>
<p>Though we don't know how much Druckmann's other answers were clipped or amended in the editing process, Druckmann's public annoyance with the edits was apparently enough to get Sony's attention. Sometime after Tuesday night, the PlayStation-maker <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">replaced the public interview</a> with the following message:</p>
<blockquote><p>In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.</p></blockquote>
<p>Journalists often edit interview responses for concision and clarity, but this interview skips the usual step of noting the existence of those kinds of edits near the top of the piece. And while press releases often contain executive quotes that have been carefully crafted in consultation with PR professionals, there was no indication in this article that the responses here were anything other than Druckmann's own thoughts and words.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Game publishers and console makers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/11/a-look-at-first-party-bloggers-who-connect-devs-and-gamers/">a long history</a> of sharing developer interviews directly with the public rather than having those developers' views filtered through the press. This is the first instance we can remember where the promotional process itself has become a source of controversy.

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Of the five SMGs currently in <em>XDefiant</em>, the MP5A2 is the least exciting on paper when you look underneath the hood and stack it against other options. However, something must be said about a well-balanced weapon that is easy to use. </p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Time-to-kill speed is not a strength of the MP5A2. According to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/xd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the Vector, MP7, and P90 kill faster than the MP5A2 from most ranges, and it’s not particularly close in short-range engagements. Thankfully, a class-leading ADS time and impressive sprint-to-fire time make up for that shortcoming. In addition, the versatile SMG performs better than other weapons in the class in longer-ranged gun fights thanks to an incredibly easy-to-control recoil pattern. </p>
 <p data-characters="121" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false">Don’t let the stats fool you because this SMG performs surprisingly well in action and shines in multiple areas. </p> <h2 id="h-best-mp5a2-loadout-and-class-setup" data-injectable="false">Best MP5A2 loadout and class setup </h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3385-2.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;839&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Muzzle Booster</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Chrome-lined </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Superlight </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>Fast Mag </li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Folded </li> </ul> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">First and foremost, the MP5A2 has the second slowest reload time among SMGs in <em>XDefiant</em>, so it’s essential to equip the fast mag to improve reload times. Losing vertical and horizontal recoil is never ideal, but the muzzle booster is an excellent attachment for any weapon as it improves bullet velocity. The rest of the attachments on this loadout focus on improving mobility to better compete with other meta SMGs. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> faction for MP5A2</h2> <p data-characters="601" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="false">There might be better options, but Echelon is the most fun faction to have while using the MP5A2. The Low Profile Passive Trait hides you on the mini-map even if you fire your weapon unsuppressed, which is perfect for MP5A2 flank routes. Additionally, the Digital Ghillie Suit makes you invisible while you attempt to get behind and closer to enemy lines. Players can also choose to equip the Intel Suit instead, if they want to temporarily reveal the location of enemies. Finally, the Sonar Goggles Ultra ability reveals every enemy on the map and gives you a pistol that annihilates the competition.</p>

<p data-characters="343" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Season 4 brings an exciting new reward system for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-and-mw3-players-question-not-banning-ranked-play-cheaters-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> </em>players, offering a range of items across five unique categories. To unlock these gifts, Operators will need to tackle a variety of challenges, from Contracts to the explosive Champion’s Quest. Here are all the <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> rewards and the challenges needed to get them.</p> <h2 id="h-all-season-4-call-of-duty-warzone-rewards-and-challenges" data-injectable="false">All Season 4 Call of Duty: Warzone rewards and challenges</h2> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-season-4-early-patch-notes-unlimited-tac-sprint-boots-rebirth-island-ranked-resurgence-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> <em>Warzone </em>Rewards section showcases five categories: Economics, Contracts, Social, Mode, and Champion’s Quest. Each section caters to a specific element in the game, like how Social mandates you to interact with other players. The Champion’s Quest may be the most challenging, requiring Operators to win 30 games in total within the season. Now that we’ve covered the basis of it, let’s check out all <em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em>challenges and rewards.</p>
 <h3 id="h-economics" data-injectable="false">Economics</h3> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Challenges</th><th>Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Loot Supply Crates</td><td>Treasure Hoarder Emblem</td></tr><tr><td>Loot Legendary Supply Crates</td><td>Mythical Crate Calling Card</td></tr><tr><td>Spend Cash in Battle Royale or Resurgence</td><td>Fortune Fatality Weapon Sticker</td></tr><tr><td>Purchase items from three different Buy Stations in a single Battle Royale or Resurgence match</td><td>Gilded Genetics Weapon Camo</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Most objectives can be achieved by simply playing <em>Warzone</em>. Pinging other Enemy Operators is probably the easiest to do if you want something less strenuous. It also doesn’t really matter which game mode you pick for the <em>Warzone </em>Mode rewards, whether it be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-fans-claim-warzone-in-2024-is-most-miserable-experience-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> Trios or Plunder Quads.</p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">As mentioned earlier, the Champion’s Quest will be one of the most difficult to complete. The <em>Warzone </em>Rewards page has a dedicated tracker showing how many successful matches you need to unlock. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">Those who complete these missions will witness a nuke explosion on the entire map, thus concluding the game. On the other hand, the second Champion’s Quest task involves the disarming of the nuke for the opposite effect.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-claim-call-of-duty-warzone-rewards" data-injectable="false">How to claim Call of Duty: Warzone rewards</h2> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">To claim your rewards in <em>Warzone</em>, select the Challenges section in the main menu.

 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">The rewards will be divided into their corresponding sections, which can be previewed to see their design.

        <p>Sony said they were testing compatibility for “accessing additional games on PC” earlier this year</p>

            <p>A PC adapter for Sony’s PlayStation VR2 has recently popped up in South Korea, giving a new update - albeit an unofficial one - on the incoming PC support for the PS5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/vr">VR</a> headset teased earlier this year.</p>
<!--more-->

</div>
<p>Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-officially-working-on-pc-game-support-for-the-ps-vr2-headset">announced in February</a> that they were looking into bringing PS VR2 to PC, marking a move away from the hardware’s current exclusivity to the PlayStation 5 console. While you can technically plug a PS VR2 into your computer as-is, of course, and Windows will even recognise it, it won’t work beyond simply becoming a head-mounted monitor - with definitely no controller support.</p>
<p>At the time, Sony indicated that the planned compatibility would work with PlayStation’s own VR-friendly titles on PC, with the wording vague enough to imply that it might also support other PC VR games, saying they were “testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5”. The extremely brief blog post added that the plan was to launch PC support later in 2024.</p>
<p>It seems that PS VR2 support this year still seems to be on track, as certification for a PlayStation VR 2 PC Adapter was <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053&amp;ref=uploadvr.com">recently granted</a> by South Korea’s national radio/wireless regulatory body, as spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certified-regulator/">UploadVR</a>. As you’d expect, the adapter appears to indicate a fairly simple solution to making the VR2 work on PC, forming a direct link between the existing cables and your computer rather than compatibility via wireless streaming or similar.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>As James noted back in February, the PS VR2 isn’t the cheapest headset on the block (though it’s a bit cheaper now it’s been out for a couple of years), but it’s very good value for the hardware on offer - including OLED display panels, built-in tracking and bundled controllers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, even if Sony don’t technically open up the hardware to supporting games beyond PlayStation titles, no doubt some enterprising developer will find a way in time once the hardware itself is compatible, potentially giving it a proper entry in the race for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-headset">best VR headsets</a> on PC. That might not be such a long wait, from the sounds of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/top-spin-2k25-patch-finally-adds-online-exhibitions-against-friends/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As we revealed in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-spin-2k25-qa-hangar-13-unveils-the-feature-set-of-the-long-awaited-tennis-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive interview</a> with developer Hangar 13, Top Spin 2K25 did not launch with any option to play against friends, being limited to random matchmaking only.</p>
<p>That changes with <a href="https://x.com/topspin2k/status/1795844853768868269" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today's update</a>, a download of around 440.5 MB on Steam. Hangar 13 have added the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social menu used to manage your 2K friends and platform friends</li>
<li>An entire social system which will let you invite your 2K friends and platform friends to online private matches</li>
<li>The Vivox Voice Chat System, which allows communication in online matches</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add friends from other platforms, but you will need to add their 2K Name, not the name they use on their platform directly. There are two easy ways to find your 2K Name, which you'll share with your Cross Play friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>In your&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.2k.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2K Account on the web</a>, you can see your Display Name on the Account Details tab</li>
<li>In TopSpin 2K25, you can find it in Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; 2K Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the game still lacks any options to play doubles online, which is a shame (as noted in my impressions piece), given that the original Top Spin already allowed that when it launched in 2003 for the original Xbox. Hangar 13's Game Director Remi Ercolani told Wccftech that the developers were hoping to offer more options after launch; let's hope a future patch adds this much-awaited feature to Top Spin 2K25.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you're playing the game, you can use the locker code CLAYSEASON to unlock 5 100% XP Boosts and a Lacoste Men's Tennis Polo.</p>

  <p id="n1Rz4M">It’s no secret that Mercedes Varnado is a huge anime fan. The AEW wrestler-turned-actress has never been shy when it comes to sharing her love of Japanese animation, from appearing at the 2022 Royal Rumble in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SashaBanksWWE/comments/sm264k/sasha_banks_sailor_moon_attire_royal_rumble_2022/">Sailor Moon-inspired outfit</a> to serving as a presenter at this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24084825/anime-awards-2024-winners-list-jujutsu-kaisen-demon-slayer-chainsaw-man">Crunchyroll Anime Awards.</a></p>
<p id="Vu3wa5">Polygon recently had a chance to connect with Varnado, so we had to ask: <strong>What was your first favorite anime, and what’s your favorite anime now?</strong></p>
<p id="OEJsgv">My Favorite Anime is Polygon’s column dedicated to collecting the stories of the biggest celebrity anime fans in the world, charting a path from their earliest introductions to Japanese animation to the series and films they love today. Here’s what Mercedes Varnado had to say.</p>
<hr id="7Y4S7K">
<h2 id="q7lPNH"><strong>What was your first favorite anime?</strong></h2>

<p id="vnJXss"><em>Sailor Moon</em> was a major success during its initial broadcast, extending past its planned six month production in 1992 to air multiple seasons over the course of five years. In combining the interpersonal drama and storytelling of magical girl anime with the action-oriented aesthetic of series like<em> Saint Seiya</em> and others, the series was able to win a dedicated audience that endures to this day. </p>
<p id="MuZYDs">The adventures of the teenage superheroine Sailor Moon and her fellow Sailor Guardians told a complex and emotionally resonant story, anchored by themes of love, friendship, and navigating the day-to-day challenges of adolescence. It was these qualities that allowed the series to successfully make the leap to audiences in the United States, standing out as one of, if not the, most notable female-centric action series of its time.</p>

<p id="q9L7fx">The series also became well known for its trailblazing depiction of a same-sex relationship between Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, though this relationship was obfuscated and censored during the anime’s first broadcast in the West, with Uranus and Neptune being depicted as “cousins” rather than lovers in the initial English dub of <em>Sailor Moon</em>. However, this omission has since been rectified in both subsequent releases of the 1992 anime and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22519700/pretty-guardian-sailor-moon-eternal-the-movie-review-netflix">other anime adaptations</a> of the series.</p>
<h2 id="Rr5DO3"><strong>What’s your favorite anime now?</strong></h2>

<p id="TTMS62">Since the premiere of studio Bones’ adaptation in 2016, <em>My Hero Academia</em> has remained one of the most popular anime series in recent memory, totaling at seven seasons and four feature-length films as of this writing. <em>My Hero Academia</em> was a series that hit at what felt like <em>precisely</em> the right time in the cultural zeitgeist, riding the wave of superhero popularity brought about by the likes of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23519049/best-marvel-movies-mcu-ranked-worst">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23578415/new-dc-movies-james-gunn-release-date-superman-batman-schedule-calendar-upcoming">DC Cinematic Universe</a> to tell an inspirational, high-spirited story about overcoming obstacles and aspiring to new heights against all odds. The story of Izuku “Deku” Midoriya, a powerless student in a world full of superheroes who becomes the apprentice of All Might, the most powerful hero of all, is a drama that channels the emotional dimension of Spider-Man and the moral clarity of Superman to create an uplifting saga about heroism triumphing over adversity.</p>
<div id="We0rFb"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1FdEBTJXus?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="2z28dS">Aside from Deku, both the anime and the manga boast a large supporting cast of characters whose respective arcs and personalities flesh out the series’ overall exploration of what it means to be a hero. While arguably not as front and center as in the case of <em>Sailor Moon</em>, <em>My Hero Academia</em> features several notable female heroines including Ochaco Uraraka, Deku’s classmate and ally; Nana Shimura, All Might’s mentor and the prior possessor of “One For All”; and Cathleen Bate, one of the most powerful heroes in the world who operates under the alias “Star and Stripe.”</p>
<p id="FC7pch">When juxtaposed alongside one another, there are obvious qualities that <em>Sailor Moon</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em> share with one another. Both series feature superheroes, yes, but on a deeper level, <em>Sailor Moon</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em> are about adolescents growing into their identities and responsibilities as young adults, tackling the challenges that come with both embracing their new abilities and balancing their obligations as heroes, and becoming stronger and wiser through overcoming adversity. In short: They’re stories tailor-made to speak to and inspire their audiences, so it’s no wonder then that both of these anime would mean so much to Varnado.</p>
