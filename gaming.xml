Today is release day for The Game Kitchen's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stone-of-madness">The Stone Of Madness</a>, an isometric tactical stealth game set in an 18th century monastery - "isometric tactical stealth game" being a pretty clinical way to describe the plight of sundry lost souls exploring a maze of hellish Catholic art populated by guards and ghouls. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As in Commandos, you control a group of characters with different skills, strengths and weaknesses. Unlike in Commandos, your characters have sanity bars and a range of narratively-grounded foibles and phobias - either present from the get-go, or sprouted in response to the hardships you put them through. Lewis Gordon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-stone-of-madness-review">done a review for Eurogamer</a> and he makes it sound extremely appealing, half-cooked plot and tricksy controls notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in The Stone Of Madness partly because it's from the Spanish studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, a terrific study in religious horror, and partly because I've been thinking lately about the role of monastic orders in developing "modern" European understandings of time. For the philosopher Michel Foucault, the hourly and daily rites of forgotten generations of monks paved the way for the 9-to-5. Writing in <a href="https://archive.org/details/disciplinepunish0000fouc_j5k6">Discipline And Punish</a>, he describes the monasteries as "the specialists of time, the great technicians of rhythm and regular activities", and explores how they influenced the secular world by way of attached schools and poorhouses and eventually, industrial workplaces that "long retained a religious air".
</p>
<p>
This ancient discipline of timekeeping, as Foucault describes it, can also be traced to the variably time-locked worlds of video games. Being a game set in a monastery, The Stone Of Madness naturally makes the connection explicit. Its challenges and opportunities follow an elaborate day-night cycle, requiring you to match the right character to the right hour if you're to succeed. It takes inspiration on this count from another, much older Spanish production, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Abad%C3%ADa_del_Crimen">The Abbey Of Crime</a>, itself a loose adaptation of Umberto Eco's gargantuan monastic mystery novel The Name Of The Rose. 
</p><p>
All this makes me wonder whether "monastic time" is a concept worth pursuing to other, non-monastic games, as both alternative and precursor to the better-known idea of the "game as a job", encapsulated by live service looting simulators. I'll hopefully have something lengthier to say about all that in the next few weeks. For the moment, The Stone Of Madness seems worth a stab. There's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">a Steam demo</a> live at the time of writing.

He’s ben making RPGs there ever since, from cult-classics like Xbox 360 exclusive <em>Lost Odyssey </em>to smaller mobile games like <em>Terra Battle</em>. Most recently his team shipped <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantasian-final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-nobuo-uemats-1851729068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantasian-final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-nobuo-uemats-1851729068"><em>Fantasian: Neo Dimension</em>, an excellent old-school RPG</a></span> that began life as an Apple Arcade release in 2021, before recently getting remastered for consoles and PC. </p><p><em>Fantasian</em> definitely felt heavily inspired by <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. It starred an amnesiac fighter trying to save a world on the brink of chaos, aided by an eclectic group of noble misfits. The details were different but the overall mood and focus on narrative drama felt reminiscent of SNES-era Final Fantasy games. Sakaguchi reportedly replayed <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, which he helped write and produce, before making <em>Fantasian </em>and considered both games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasian-tied-final-fantasy-6-hironobu-sakaguchi-love-family?amp=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasian-tied-final-fantasy-6-hironobu-sakaguchi-love-family?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kindred spirits through their mutual focus on family</a></span>. </p><p>But his next project will apparently feel even more closely inspired by one of his old franchise’s peak games. “It’s generally going to follow a similar style to my previous works, and it’ll be something that can be a successor to<em> Final Fantasy VI</em> in a good way—our goal is to create something old but new at the same time,” the veteran creator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told <em>The Verge</em></a></span>. “It’ll be part two of my farewell note.”</p><p>Sakaguchi said he had intended for <em>Fantasian</em> to be his final game, but had too much fun working with the team behind it to actually retire when it was done. “Humans are greedy creatures, aren’t we?” he told <em>The Verge</em>. “For that reason, I’m currently working on a new project with the same team that worked on <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>.” </p><p>We don’t yet know what being a successor to<em> Final Fantasy VI </em>will mean for Mistalker’s next game. Retro HD-2D graphics? A sprawling cast of disparate characters brought together through shared tragedy and common purpose? A show-stopping opera scene foiled by a giant octopus? Or maybe Sakaguchi intends the connection to be more subtle and philosophical than that. </p><p>Fans will always pine for the direct sequel to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-hd-2d-dragon-quest-3-square-enix-1851702829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-hd-2d-dragon-quest-3-square-enix-1851702829">they’ve dreamed of but never got</a></span>. The legendary RPG maker, on the other hand, has much grander ambitions. He said, “In the distant future, or maybe after I have already left this world, I imagine this game will find its meaning if someone chooses to look into the legacy of either myself or <em>Final Fantasy</em>.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/martha-is-dead-playstation-cut-content-face-peeling-masturbation/">Wired Productions</a> and Pollar Studio have released the first of three trailers for Karma: The Dark World in the lead-up to the release of the title. Karma: The Dark World is an upcoming first-person psychological horror that's set to channel iconic movie and game directors such as Lynch, Kojima, and Nolan. The first trailer is called 'ROAM.' At the moment, the release date for Karma: The Dark World still hasn't been announced, but it's said that it will soon be announced, most likely coinciding with the trailers that will be released. You can watch the brand-new trailer for the game below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KARMA: The Dark World | ROAM Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQA9fdoVetQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As said above, this is the first of three trailers to be released for Karma: The Dark World, with the developers planning to release them to release key aspects of the game's story, as well as showing off the immersive world and intense gameplay mechanics that you'll have to contend with when playing the game. This first trailer is used to set the stage for the game, so players know what they are getting into when jumping into this first-person psychological horror.</p>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of director David Lynch. His art has had a profound influence on our game development, inspiring us to pay tribute to and learn from his work," said Ke Yang, Art Director of Pollard Studio. Even in the above trailer released, a quote by the iconic director is used to help set the scene.</p>
<p>For those who are hearing about this game for the first time, Karma: The Dark World is a psychological horror title where players will be playing as a Roam Agent and investigating the deepest and darkest secrets of their suspects' minds. The game takes place in an alternate timeline after the war in Germany. In the alternate timeline, Germany has instead fallen into a dystopian state that is ruled over by the Leviathan Corporation. The corporation uses mass surveillance and mind-bending technology to keep an eye on the citizens of the country, providing no privacy at all. Playing as Daniel McGovern, you investigate crime scenes and interview suspects to then report your findings back to Leviathan. However, it's not quite as it seems, and the world begins to crumble around him, where he doubts everything and anyone, including himself.</p>
<p>Karma: The Dark World has been developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376200/KARMA_The_Dark_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released soon on PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Karma: The Dark World when it releases?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cheating-in-valorant-spiked-during-riots-holiday-break/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the the weeks before and after the start of 2025, when Riot Games employees are taking their annual holiday rest, recorded instances of cheating in VALORANT doubled across all regions. While the rise in cheating is now under control, the spike shows that it is a never-ending battle between developer and cheater.</p>



<p>But how did cheating in VALORANT get so bad during the holiday break? The head of VALORANT’s anti-cheat explained in a <a href="https://x.com/deteccphilippe/status/1883945555102957617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy post</a> yesterday.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheating-in-valorant-reached-historic-levels-in-brazil">Cheating in VALORANT Reached Historic Levels in Brazil</h2>



<p>According to head of VALORANT anti-cheat Phillip “mirageofpenguins” Koskinas, Riot’s holiday break opened the door for cheaters to take advantage. During this time, with less resources and people available to detect cheaters and roll out fixes, “the cheaters that weren’t immediately detected started multiplying.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via @deteccphilippe on X.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From the days before Christmas through the first week of January, the percentage of matches with a cheater detected rose in all regions, but none as dramatically as Brazil. In Brazil, which already had the highest percentage of cheaters of any region, the percentage of matches with a cheater spiked from just under 5% to around 12%. According to Riot, Brazil cheaters regularly use a “pixelbot” that reads the screen, identifies enemy outlines and heads, and then submits mouse events to the OS that points the cheater towards that enemy.</p>



<p>The pixelbot cheats popular amongst Brazil cheaters are supposedly cheap and easy to install, but Riot says they’re also easy to spot. Once the Riot holiday break ended and normal anti-cheat detection resumed, the cheater percentage in Brazil (and other regions) dropped dramatically to a lower level than it was before the break. Riot says the the January 10-13 weekend featured its “highest sustained ban velocity on record, with almost seven suspensions occurring every minute.”</p>



<p>In yesterday’s post, Riot admitted that the fight against cheaters will never end. Because VALORANT is free and there’s little to no barrier to entry, no cheater can be truly permanently exiled. While Riot team remains committed to disrupting cheaters, they also plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implement ranked rollback in the next act</a>, which restore rank rating to players that lost against caught cheaters.</p>

It will launch on March 18, with early access for Digital Deluxe Edition buyers beginning March 14. Unlike previous years, <em>MLB The Show 25</em> will not be available via Game Pass. <span id="more-940834"></span></p><p>Paul Skenes, Elly De La Cruz, and Gunnar Henderson will be featured on <em>MLB The Show 25</em>‘s first-ever three-athlete cover. Here are short profiles for each player:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Paul Skenes</strong>&nbsp;– Paul Skenes’ journey began in high school and continued through college, where he cemented his status as one of the most talented young pitchers in baseball by winning a national championship before being selected as the No. 1 overall pick by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2023 MLB Draft. The following season, Skenes made his MLB debut and became the first player in MLB history to start the All-Star Game just one year after being drafted. He capped off an incredible 2024 season by earning National League Rookie of the Year honors and being named to the All-MLB First Team. His story and skillset align perfectly with Road to the Show, where you can chart your own path to greatness.</li><li><strong>Elly De La Cruz</strong> – Elly De La Cruz’s meteoric rise from the minors to the majors perfectly captures the excitement of working up to a big league debut and becoming a star. Since making his Major League debut in 2023 with the Cincinnati Reds, Elly has consistently proven to be one of the most electrifying players on the field. He became one of the youngest players in MLB history to hit for the cycle and is renowned for his blazing speed on the bases and his cannon-like arm, further cementing his status as one of the league’s most promising talents. The 2024 All-Star showcases an impressive five-tool skillset and a dynamic switch-hitting approach—exactly what <em>MLB The Show</em> fans dream of when developing or acquiring their starting shortstop in Franchise mode.</li><li><strong>Gunnar Henderson</strong> – Rounding out this triple play of talent is the 2023 American League Rookie of the Year, Gunnar Henderson. Selected 42nd overall in the 2019 MLB Draft, Gunnar quickly ascended through the Orioles’ farm system, making his MLB debut late in the 2022 season. Heading into 2023, he was named the #1 prospect on MLB’s Top 100 list. In his first full season in the majors, Gunnar became a cornerstone of the Orioles’ young core, helping lead the team to its first postseason appearance in seven years. His outstanding performance earned him AL Rookie of the Year honors and a Silver Slugger Award. Gunnar’s star continued to rise in 2024, as he was selected to start in the MLB All-Star Game and compete in the Home Run Derby. His MLB journey resonates deeply with <em>MLB The Show</em> fans who strive to dominate head-to-head competition in their pursuit of greatness on the diamond.</li></ul></blockquote><p>And here is a short description of the game:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Forge your baseball dreams in <em>MLB The Show 25</em>—the definitive baseball journey, powered by you.</p><p>Ignite your passion and build your very own path to greatness—from high school all the way to the Hall of Fame!

			<p>fYesterday, Polish developer People Can Fly <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it is co-developing the upcoming prequel Gears of War: E-Day with The Coalition. People Can Fly has a long history with the franchise, having ported the first installment to PC and having led the development of Gears of War: Judgment, so it's a return home in a way for them.</p>
<p>PCF CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski stated:</p>
<p><em>Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.</em></p>
<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.</em></p>
<p>Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition, added:</p>
<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic. We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, Gears of War: E-Day will take fans back fourteen years before the events of the first entry, to Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde first emerged from the underground of the planet Sera to wreak havoc among humans. This will provide the chance to explore the beginning of the narrative as well as the birth of the close friendship between Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.</p>
<p>No&nbsp;<span>official release window has been provided yet, although rumors&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point</a> to a launch sometime this year—and a PlayStation 5 port <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also be on the cards</a></span>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-vegas-mod-fallout-nuevo-mexico-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lead developer on ambitious-looking <i>Fallout: New Vegas&nbsp;</i>mod<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has canceled the project in order to prioritize his "mental health" and to "face reality".</p>

<p>In a message shared on the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), developer Zapshock says that while&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has been his "passion" and "obsession" for years, the project's workload and costs are "too great".</p>

<p>As such, continuing with&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>'s development "simply isn't sustainable for [Zapshock] and everyone involved, including voice actors", and so the decision was made to cancel the project. Zapshock says the decision was "painful", but "necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=1SqRHiLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=EcpTjdIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ambitious&nbsp;<em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em>mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has sadly been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Before its cancellation,&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>was set to be a mod roughly the size of one of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series' DLC packs, and it would have taken you to the US state of New Mexico, as the name suggests.</p>

<p>The mod was to be set five years after the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, putting it several decades before the events of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>, both of which take place as humanity is beginning to rebuild something resembling a coherent society.</p>

<p>Per a Game Rant <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-new-vegas-mods-good-nuevo-mexico-scripting/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> from February last year, the modders were planning to include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>-style origins for characters in&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, including one for a ghoul character, which would have fundamentally changed the mod's gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like it's no wonder the mod was canceled; Zapshock and his team clearly had an insane level of ambition for&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, and with just four people working on the project, they were bound to burn out sooner or later.</p>




<p><em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod to have been canceled in recent months; back in October, the developers of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a mod that attempted to remake the entirety of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the fourth game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended" rel="nofollow">shut down their mod</a> due to "a combination of factors".</p>

<p>If you are looking for a DLC-sized&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod experience, however, all is not lost. There's still&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now" rel="nofollow">launched in July last year</a>&nbsp;and which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow">attracted a million downloads</a> by October. It's a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod, though, so you'll need the base game to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/598008/atari-nubeo-asteroids-watch-retro-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Atari has released a collection of new watches with a unique design that celebrates the 45th anniversary of <em>Asteroids</em>. In the original version of the game that debuted in 1979, spotting and shooting a passing UFO would earn you extra points. On the Asteroids watch, a pair of orbiting UFOs are less of a threat and are instead used to represent the hour and minute hands — no numbers needed.</p><p>Created in collaboration with watchmaker Nubeo (which previously released a collection of <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/space-invaders-limited-edition"><em>Space Invaders</em>-themed timepieces</a>) the new Asteroids collection features five styles, each with a differently colored band — nebula blue, plasma pumpkin, supernova red, nova nightfall, and celestial citrine — and varying colors for the watchface elements. They’re <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/atari-limited-edition">available through Nubeo’s website</a>, which lists each watch’s price as being discounted to $499 from $1,650. You can also <a href="https://atari.com/collections/atari-x-nubeo-watches">order them through Atari’s website</a>, which just lists the price as $499 each, although some have already sold out. Each style is limited to just 125 pieces.</p><p>The watch uses a Japanese automatic movement that powers three spinning discs. The smallest features a recreation of the game’s simple triangular spaceship in the center that serves as the watch’s second hand, while two larger discs, rotating at different speeds, portray asteroids drifting through space and the UFOs that function as the hour and minute hands.</p><p>All of the graphical elements on the Asteroids watch’s face are printed with glow-in-the-dark “Swiss Super-LumiNova” pigments and are protected beneath a durable sapphire lens and a stainless steel case. The watch is water resistant with a 21 ATM (atmosphere) rating and a screw-down crown, making it durable enough for recreational diving. It comes in a protective case with an interior that borrows design elements from the Atari Video Computer System (VCS) that launched in 1977.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Did you have a tamagotchi as a kid? I did, and yes, I too let it die. I am thankful that the handheld LCD graphics of the era did not allow me to witness my companion blob's amiable decline into shit-caked starvation. I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Before I peel back the metafictional layers I guess I should tell you briefly about Yolk Heroes itself, which featured in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yolk-heroes-a-long-tamago">one of Alice0's (RPS in peace) screenshot round-ups</a>, many moons ago. The gist: some Dark Lord is causing a nuisance. The Fairy Queen has tasked you with hatching out and nurturing an Elf hero to take the villain down. I'm not as familiar with elf reproduction as I should be but I've played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and I'm 75% sure elves don't come from eggs. Still, I like the looks of the game's "idle RPG" malarkey. It sounds like I'll have plenty of time to get the laundry done while my chickelf is busy grinding level-1 rats.
</p>
<p>
"Part digital pet game, part RPG adventure, and part casual idle game, Yolk Heroes is a charming blend of many different elements," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/">Steam page</a> explains. "Quest and grind to protect the citizens of the realm, or simply enjoy your digital friend!" Here be tray-tray to wash that down. Game Boy Color-flavoured art direction = good.

Hearty, innocent fun, you might think. The user reviews certainly paint a rosy picture. But now for the horrifying twist: the devs are making another virtual pet game called Poke Place, rendered in simpler monochrome pixelart. It fits snugly inside Yolk Heroes, "so your Virtual Pet can have Virtual Pets". 
</p><p>
"You know you've always wanted this!" explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2417850/view/547851035326023072?l=english">a new Steam post</a>, with an air of jovial malice so concentrated I can feel my skin exfoliating as I read. "Poke place is pronounced to rhyme with yolk. Poke being slang for little buddy and all that. It won't have any plot importance, but it will have the importance of getting to raise a little fairy thing! Also, some of the best pixel art we did for the project but ended up being cut from the main game is being re-used to give it some real pizzazz!"
</p>
<p>
While games-within-the-game aren't unusual - even Call Of Duty likes to Nolan it up now and then - the disturbing element here is that Poke Place is billed as a game for your Virtual Pet, not you. Will your chickelf treat the "little fairy thing" as they themselves were treated? Is this where our fond technological ambitions have led us, to a place where tamagotchis are smart enough to let their own tamagotchis perish in a cascade of doleful emojis and poop?</p>
<p>Ah, but perhaps the tamagotchis will learn different lessons from our colossal frivolity and apathy. Perhaps your chickelf will strive to be a better custodian and mentor for their fairy sprog than you ever were for them. Honestly, this sounds worse: your virtual pet is going to make you feel bad about yourself. It's a facet of the AI utopia/dystopia debate I hadn't considered.
</p>
<p>
It's not clear when Poke Place will be added to Yolk Heroes, but 14 Hours Productions are hoping to release the update later this year. No guarantees, though, because "the lead developer on it also has a full time job NOT working on cute games like this, so it's a bit slow going! Bills are hard!" Fair play. I will end this with the thought that while I've played many a game-within-the-game, I've yet to play a game-within-the-game-within-the-game. I suspect this idea has probably occurred to 14 Hours Productions. I hope they give that "little fairy thing" a virtual pet game too, so that my chickelf can experience the terrible vertigo I'm feeling right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<div><p>Following 185 layoffs and a studio shutdown, Ubisoft has sent an internal memo to staff via its Agoro Newsroom about the recent layoffs, saying that the decision was made due to “finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success.”</p><p>The internal memo confirms that approximately 65 positions where eliminated at Ubisoft Dusseldorf, approximately 100 roles are effected at Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections, and approximately 20 roles at Ubisoft Stockholm, taking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-another-studio-185-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total to 185 people laid off</a>. In addition, Ubisoft’s Leamington site would be shut down.</p></div>



<p>The update reads,</p>



<p>“Jeff Combos, Studio Manager of Ubisoft Dusseldorf, informed the studio yesterday about a plan to reduce its headcount by approximately 65 positions. Most of these reductions would affect production roles currently not assigned to active development for a prolonged period of time. The studios in Berlin and Mainz are not affected.</p>



<p>Also yesterday, Lisa Opie, Managing Director of the UK studios informed the teams about planned restructuring measures aimed at ensuring Reflections’ long-term stability and meeting its financial targets. Approximately 100 roles could be made redundant across Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections. Additionally, this proposal also includes the decision to close the Leamington site.</p>



<p>“I understand the uncertainty these changes will bring. We are committed to supporting everyone who may be impacted during this transition. Let me assure you, these decisions were not made lightly. We believe they are essential to improve our operational efficiency and ensure the long-term sustainability of our studios, the zone and the company,” says Benedikt Grindel, Production Zone 4 Managing Director.</p>



<p>In parallel, Ubisoft Stockholm announced yesterday its plan to reduce approximately 20 roles. This step is necessary to secure the studio’s long-term success and refine the studio strategy.</p>



<p>Individual meetings were held with affected employees yesterday.</p>



<p>“We know that this decision impacts more than just the studio and its projects; it impacts people-our colleagues, teammates, and friends. We deeply understand how difficult this is, and supporting everyone through this transition is our utmost priority,” Thomas Andren, Production Zone 3 and Stockholm studio Managing Director, said yesterday in his message to the team.</p>



<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>



<p>All the team members that are affected have already been informed, and necessary processes are underway depending on the labor laws in each country.</p>



<p>While difficult, the changes announced yesterday are targeted at us finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success. This is driven by a strong conviction: our ability to keep creating and operating unique, powerful, and popular brands that extend beyond video games.”</p>



<p>Speaking with both current and former employee’s at Ubisoft, it’s currently unclear on if any Ubisoft projects where effected with the recent layoffs. It’s understood that Ubisoft Reflections are primarily developing an unannounced WW2 live-service extraction shooter named CREST, which was supported by some staff at Ubisoft Leamington. Ubisoft Leamington staff where working on Avatar content.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft is currently in the process of exploring its options to stay afloat, including a potential deal with&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese company Tencent</a>, where both companies are in talks for a new venture centered around Ubisoft’s current assets.</p>



<p>When asked for comment on whether or not any projects were cancelled, a Ubisoft spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is one of the largest and most well-known video game companies in the world. Known for franchises such as EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Battlefield, and more, EA’s presence in the industry is felt almost everywhere. Because of that, EA’s earnings reports are closely watched by analysts, investors, and consumers alike. </p>



<p>That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into EA’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead.</p>



<p>What is EA’s focus on the heels of recent game releases? What are investors looking for? Are there any concerns or roadblocks? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-ea-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next EA Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its third quarter (Q3) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2025 on Tuesday, February 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to why the company is releasing its third quarter earnings in February, EA—like many companies—has a fiscal calendar that runs from April 1-March 31. Their third quarter runs from October 1-December 31, meaning the latest call will include information from the holiday sales season.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q1: April 1 – June 30</li>



<li>Q2: July 1 – September 30</li>

<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-ea-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To EA’s  Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to EA’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via the company’s website. Simply do the following:</p>

<li>Under “Upcoming &amp; Recent Events”, select “Webcast” for the Q3 2025 Earnings Call</li>
</ol>

Most can be find on the “<a href="https://ir.ea.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quarterly Results</a>” page and the aforementioned “Events &amp; Presentations” page.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-ea">What To Expect From EA</h2>



<p>When EA releases its latest earnings, it will provide an update on the overall revenue for both Q3 and FY2025. There will also be updates on currently known in-development games from the company as well as a lookback at games that were released during the current fiscal year. Lastly, the company prepared investors for lower-than-expected net bookings after it revealed that both EA Sports FC 25 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed</a> to meet internal revenue expectations.</p>



<p>With the lower results, EA adjusted its expected net bookings for the quarter from $2.4-$2.5 billion to $2.21 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-ea-earnings-report">The Last EA Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When EA announced its earnings for Q2 FY2025 last October, it was revealed that the company broke a record for Q2 net bookings of $2.08 billion. It was also mentioned that the company expected American Football to generate over $1 billion alone in net bookings for FY2025. Lastly, EA said that 74% of all net bookings for the prior 12 months came via Live Services.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-earnings-calls">What Are Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

If you registered through the Xbox Insider Programme, the Baldur’s Gate 3 Stress Test application is now live in the Xbox Insider Hub for you to download.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were one of the PS5 players who downloaded Patch 8 early, Larian said you can roll back to Patch 7 by deleting and reinstalling the game. “Think of it as a time-travel mechanic,” the developer said in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/539969735985464667" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an update on Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Patch 8 stress test, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC players will be able to test out cross-play by either creating or joining a lobby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8 also adds split-screen to Xbox Series S. Split-screen on Microsoft’s less powerful console was cited as the cause of Baldur’s Gate 3’s delay on Xbox, given the company’s commitment to parity between Xbox Series S and X for all games. Microsoft ultimately made an exception for Baldur's Gate 3 so it could launch later in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there’s photo mode and 12 new subclasses to get stuck into. Larian hasn’t said when Patch 8 will be made available generally, but it’s expected later in 2025.

The update adds new, gruesome cinematics for some of the game’s evil endings, new legendary actions for Honor Mode encounters, and official in-game mod support.</p><p>However, with Patch 7 comes a big ole asterisk from the game’s maker, Larian Studios. The patch is currently only available for PC, meaning that players will be unable to load cross-platform save files from PC on their console versions. PC / Mac multiplayer is also disabled. Larian says that it intends to launch Patch 7 on consoles and Mac sometime in October, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827343/baldurs-gate-3-reactivates-ps5-cross-saves">if you like to hop between desktop and console to play <em>BG3</em></a>, you’ll have to wait about a month.

According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjU4ODk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Baldur’s Gate 3 mod support is coming in September</a></h2><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzIzMDU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">Baldur’s Gate 3 developer is moving on from Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2><div><p>With the sheer popularity surrounding <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the game is ripe for an expansion — but if it ever happens, it won’t be made by its developer Larian Studios. During a panel at the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Larian founder Swen Vincke revealed that the studio plans on moving away from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">as first reported by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>“We’re not going to make new expansions, which everybody is expecting us to do.

I’m reminded of this by the utterly bizarre reaction to the most recent <em>Superman</em> TV spot, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1883606788249206932&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1883606788249206932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by James Gunn</a></span> and responded to by those who purport to be the movie’s future audience as if he’s committed a war crime. Stop it! Everyone just stop it! You’re liking things all wrong, and it’s ruining it for everyone.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>So, by “fans” I mean the word very literally, “fanatics.” I don’t mean those who engage with media by playing, watching, or reading with a desire to find enjoyment: I mean those who believe they are in a relationship with the work, that there’s some sort of two-way communication going on. These inverted parasocial relationships, where the audience believes itself in authority over the subject, are having a grim effect on culture. We’ve reached a position where a director is immediately defending himself against an onslaught of wildly inaccurate and frankly concerning criticism from those who believe themselves in charge of how an unreleased film is supposed to be. And, as a consequence, those with the money are starting to believe this madding crowd needs to be heard.</p><p>On January 26, James Gunn—the director of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movies, and the person now in charge of DC’s cinematic universe—shared via X a new teaser for his forthcoming <em>Superman</em>.</p><p>I am a Superman skeptic. Not a <em>Superman</em> skeptic, because I’ve yet to see the movie that hasn’t been released, so have no rational basis on which to form an opinion. But boy do I have Superman opinions. I dislike how people making films or TV shows never seem to know how to cope with this specific character, seeing his innate, all-powerful nature as an issue that needs to be removed. That’s a fascinating problem to solve! You have this essentially immortal god, a being of absolute power to tell stories about, but no one seems to know how to portray him without instantly resorting to reducing him to mortality, whether by weakening him or opposing him with an equally powerful enemy. I have a “Time to Kryptonite” meter on which all Superman fiction is judged, and almost all of it fails miserably. (I know nothing about comics, including <em>Superman </em>comics, and expect this has all been far more interestingly investigated there.)</p><p>I must make an aside for the recently concluded <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, that repeatedly failed on Time to Kryptonite in every one of its arcs, but actually handled the challenge better than everything else. It showed Superman’s genuine, consequential vulnerabilities: his love for his family, his grief for his parents, his terror at his wife’s cancer, his panic at his son’s crippling anxiety disorder. All of this made an immortal figure meaningful, albeit constantly undermined by yet another weaker enemy using various colors of Kryptonite to punch him in the face.</p><p>I worry James Gunn’s movie could repeat the same issues, taking this fascinating dilemma of an invulnerable hero, and rendering it moot by saying some green rocks make it go away. That would be disappointing. However, I’m not organizing a campaign to demand he not do this, nor declaring the film will be obsolete should he do so. I’m not under any delusion that I’m in any form of dialogue with this piece of art: I will be its supplicant viewer.</p><figure id="" data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not so for those who responded to Gunn’s short clip. The 30 seconds of context-less images includes three seconds of Superman flying through some ice, presumably near his Fortress of Solitude. I watched it and thought this: “There’s Superman, flying past some ice. Ooh, he rolled over.” I had no further thoughts about that moment, more interested in other aspects like the role of the yellow flag and the potential silliness of a Godzilla-like creature rampaging through Metropolis.</p><p>But this, I have since learned, is not how the film’s “fans” responded. They are <em>furious</em> about those three seconds of flying. Livid. Their reaction has become “viral.” It has offended vast numbers of people who believe themselves the movie’s core audience, and they’re explaining to Gunn in their thousands about how he’s misused CGI, the ways in which he’s messed up some face-replacement technology, and how actor David Corenswet’s eye is millimeters out of line and thus the film is a disaster. (I wish any of this was an exaggeration.)</p><p>This reached such a pitch that Gunn felt the need to respond (nooooo!) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Threads</a></span>, calmly stating that the entire furor over his CG-based crime exists only in the imaginations of the angry mob.</p><p>“There is absolutely zero CG in his face,” Gunn explains. “People’s faces can look different when you put a wide angle lens up close. The background plate in Svalbard is 100% real as is David.”</p><p>So yeah, the criticisms were conspiracies, entire mobs built around this unforgiveable faux pas that hadn’t taken place. They needed to find <em>something</em> wrong, something that couldn’t pass their perfection test, grabbed hold of this (despite the damned Godzilla), and were utterly wrong. It was only ever a cool, practical flying effect, like it looked.</p><p>The endless criticisms about Corenswet’s eyes gets to me more than anything else. Firstly, it’s something people spotted by pausing a three second clip on a monitor in front of their face, forgetting that this is a movie intended to be watched in a theater and no rational person would even study the exact positions of his eyeballs in those circumstances. It’s a fuss about <em>nothing</em>. And what if those are just his eyes?! For God’s sake, the actor who plays Lois in <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, Elizabeth Tulloch, has strabismus, meaning her eyes point in slightly different directions at all times. It’s a normal thing. God,  you awful people.</p><figure id="" data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can’t tell you the number of podcasts and YouTube channels I’ve given up on, because the creators spend their entire time worrying about, or directly responding to, the loudest voices in their audience. I struggle to think of any I’ve stuck with that aren’t plagued by this issue. A constant, spoken concern about the portion of their audience who doesn’t like, or doesn’t accept, or doesn’t tolerate, some small aspect of what they do. It’s mostly delivered jokingly, “Ooh, don’t say that, you know what our DMs will be like!” but it’s never with any humor. It’s fear. A show’s fans can cause its creators fear.</p><p>And the mistake is the two-way engagement. Before the internet, the movies, TV shows, books, games, plays, whatever, were the authority. They defiantly existed, and the audience either liked them or disliked them in futile near-privacy. The audience’s means of affecting the art’s&nbsp;existence lay purely in choosing whether to continue being the audience. If they didn’t like the show, they didn’t tune in. If they hated the book, they didn’t buy the next one. They could tell their friends to join or not join the audience, and that was effective, but based on their own real-life relationships. Sure, critics had some influence too, but this again was a one-way communication with an audience that mutely chose whether to engage.</p><p>And movies and TV shows and games weren’t worse for it back then! It turns out, they didn’t need to be told what to do by an audience that hadn’t yet watched or read or played them in order to create excellent art. Based on the thousands of years of evidence, it’s perhaps reasonable to conclude it’s not a vital part of the creative process. Yet, today, a piece of media’s purported audience sees itself as so utterly crucial that without its constant input, only terrible things can result.</p><p>“Thank goodness we were there to tell James Gunn not to use bad CG on Superman’s face in that one flying scene!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they tell themselves</a></span>, likely never bothering to listen to the response that there was no CG, good or bad. Almost definitely not replying to say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I was completely wrong.” (I checked. They didn’t.)</p><p>Instead, when their fury is contradicted by regular people saying, “Ooh, I enjoyed that teaser! Can’t wait to see the movie!” their reaction is to create even more elaborate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deranged theories</a></span> that explain these normal people as evil agents.</p><figure id="" data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But this obviously isn’t unique to this incident. It’s everything, all of the time, this irrationally entitled belief that the media you consume owes you something. That you are the authority now, that the subject must bend to your whim, and deviance from this is terrible customer service that must be punished. It’s horrible.</p><p>Everyone’s liking everything wrong, and it’s spoiling it! For god’s sake, all creators, you have to stop responding to these voices, too. They aren’t your audience, and when you listen to them, you misrepresent the vast majority of people who are waiting to enjoy your output. Whether it’s a podcast constantly falling over itself to avoid an email, or a movie studio panicking because some loud group of dumbasses made a bunch of YouTube videos, just ignore them. They will never be satisfied, it will never be good enough, and their motivations are suspect and unspecific. </p><p>If only our artists would re-establish and reinforce the one-way relationship, reclaim the authority. And then once something exists, listen to curated, informed voices whose goal is to see something be the best it can be, not to tear it down to bathe in its entrails.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Collectors who were already unsure about test card auctions last year are now being extra critical of grading house CGC as well. </p><p> “We’re aware of recent claims regarding CGC graded Pokémon Prototype and Playtest cards that have been sold across various platforms,” one of the sellers,  Alt auction house, told <em>PokéBeach</em> in a statement. “CGC has assured us they are taking these allegations seriously and are conducting a thorough review.
