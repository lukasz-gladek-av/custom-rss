            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Victory Royale. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We all know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-10-will-feature-gorillaz-starting-tomorrow">Fortnite is the king of crossovers</a>, but the tables have turned in recent years, with Fortnite crossing over into LEGO territory. We've had a handful of sets come out that represent the weird and whacky world of one of the most popular battle royale games, like the Durrr Burger and iconic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-fortnite-battle-bus-a-digital-to-physical-triumph">Battle Bus</a>. The most recent set, which dropped earlier this month, is the gigantic Mecha Team Leader. I'm not the biggest Fortnite player, but even I can't deny how much fun this build was. </p><div catalogid="b1c6547c-25f1-4150-8779-f8bb2aa193e5" id="227362"><div id="227362" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader is easily the biggest build <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-batman-forever-batmobile-set-76304">I've done here on IGN</a>. When the box arrived in the mail I was genuinely surprised at its size. Coming in at just under two feet, the box is absolutely massive. The set itself is comprised of 2,503 pieces and is spread out among 19 bags. The instruction booklet is just as heavy-duty, feeling like a graphic novel at 317 pages. The instructions and sticker sets even came in a premium-feeling envelope to protect it, which I appreciated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into when I started this build. I've built countless LEGO sets in my day, but truly nothing quite at this scale. I built this in one day because I don't know how to relax, with a couple breaks in between because my kitchen table chairs aren't comfy whatsoever. Overall, I think it took me around five or six hours. Every aspect of the mech's body is exquisitely detailed, each with their own extremely technical and unique attachment techniques. I timed it, and just one leg took me almost an hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not educated on the lore behind the Mecha Team Leader's design, but I think I can speak for everyone when I comment on how ridiculous (and ridiculously awesome) this set is. One leg is made up of what looks like ice cream, with an apple foot, while the other foot is a literal cheeseburger. I don't get it, and I don't care; this thing rules. Building the each body part was extremely satisfying, getting to see how in-depth the attachment techniques are. Every limb is movable and posable except for the knees, which unfortunately don't bend. But you can still articulate the mech's arms, hands, and fingers to put it up on your shelf however you want. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite aspects of this build is the huge sword. It cleverly uses a grey LEGO minifigure blank head and ponytail hairstyle to simulate what I'm pretty sure is a fabric tassel on the end of the sword's grip. You can slot the sword into either of the mech's hands, so feel free to pose it however you want, the sword won't fall off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mech's chest cavity opens up to allow a minifigure version of it to enter, and this is also one of the first parts of the build. You build out the pilot cockpit, complete with a detailed chair and screens to survey the battlefield, which are where most of the sticker elements come into play. The mech's armor breastplate itself was fun to build, but I'm questioning some of the sequencing in the steps here; it was difficult to attach the upper breastplate once it was fully assembled to the rest of the body without breaking off other pieces in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teddy bear head really ties the whole set together. It's the last bit of the build, and it also one of my favorite parts. I always appreciate how LEGO designers can take ordinary brick shapes and mold into an extremely detailed, uncanny recreation of what we all know to be a head, and the Mecha Team Leader's head is no different. Its eyes, ears, and little tufts of hair sticking out are awesome little details. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I don't play Fortnite, the LEGO Mecha Team Leader is one of my favorite builds I've ever done, whether for IGN or on my own. Once it's all said and done, it stands at almost 18 inches tall. It's an impressively designed and time-consuming build that I highly recommend spacing out over multiple sessions. The minifigure version of the mech, the buildable sword, and "Fortnite" printed LEGO plaque are all great additions to an already great set. I love LEGO and I'm a huge nerd when it comes to appreciating the design of massive, technical sets like this, and I can't wait to see more of what they can cook up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, a trailer leaked for a cancelled multiplayer<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-pc-port-august-2022-ps4-ps5-steam-sony-plays-1849011465"><em> Spider-Man</em> game</a> that was being developed by Insomniac. It seemed cool. So cool in fact, that it seems to have inspired folks to try and use mods to make online web-swinging with friends a reality. And one such mod is now out, and it looks great.</p> <p>On August 26, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/marvels-spider-man-co-op-multiplayer-mod-pc/">as spotted by <em>ComicBook</em></a>, a new PC-only mod has been released online that allows people to play Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> with up to six other players. The mod was developed by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hbgda">modder hbgda and is available to those who subscribe to the creator’s Patreon</a>. You can see what the mod looks like in action below, courtesy of a video shared by popular creator Kami on TikTok and Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spider-Man Remastered just got a working multiplayer mod on PC and it's amazing.</p> <p>Probably the closest thing we're going to get to The Great Web. <a href="https://t.co/6FeT3JEBbz">pic.twitter.com/6FeT3JEBbz</a></p> <p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1960452836887568680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/VqjYrZ2WvCM"> There are also multiple YouTube videos of the multiplayer <em>Spider-Man</em> mod in action</a>, and it looks surprisingly stable for something as ambitious and wild as this. Sure, it’s not perfect, but considering<em> Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> on PC was never designed to support multiplayer, let alone seven people running and swinging around the map at the same time, the fact that this mod is not only playable but looks extremely polished is incredibly impressive.</p>

 <p>Watching footage of hbgda’s mod in action has me hankering to install <em>Spider-Man</em> on my PC and try this out. It also makes me sad that we never got Insomniac’s online multiplayer Spider-Man game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-the-great-web-online-co-op-game-trailer-1851329786">It was reportedly going to be called <em>Spider-Man: The Great Web</em></a> and would have involved hopping between dimensions alongside your friends. Sadly, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a>, the game was canceled long before the trailer for it leaked in 2024 in the wake of the December 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">Insomniac data breach.</a></p> <p>While it’s very possible the game wouldn’t have had much staying power, which is a problem for a live-service video game, I would have loved to have been able to invite my pals to swing around NYC with me and cause some chaos. At the very least, I hope we see Insomniac add a multiplayer mode to a future Spider-Man game. Doesn’t have to be something elaborate, just something that looks like this mod, but which is playable on PS5, too.</p> <p>For now, if you want to swing around New York City as Spider-Man with some other Spider-People, your only option is to download this mod and set it up on your PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/september%E2%80%99s-2025-ps-plus-games-include-psychonauts-2.1282461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s that time of the month again where we get to look ahead to another batch of bundled games with PlayStation Plus. Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for September 2025 and it would be fair to say they are underwhelming.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus September 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 2nd September :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>Psychonauts 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>So who had to Google “Viewfinder PS5”, because I did. This is the first time the game has been written about on TSA, even though it was released in July 2023 on PS5 and PC, PS4 the following December, then on Xbox Series X|S this month, and Switch later this year. So what is the game about?</p>

<p><em>“Use an instant camera to challenge perception, redefine reality and reshape the world. View the world through a new lens in this charming and unique first-person puzzle adventure. Reshape a wealth of stunning environments through your instant camera’s viewfinder in order to solve a variety of mind-bending puzzles. Bring photos, paintings, sketches and postcards to life as you reshape reality and slowly uncover the surprising mysteries that lie behind this colourful world.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Viewfinder - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_lIQ2EZRH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up is Stardew Valley which originally launched in 2016 on PC and came to PS4 eight years ago. I seem to remember the PS Vita version was on PS Plus at some point. Does anyone really need to be told what Stardew Valley is about? You do, at the back? Really? Have you been living under a rock for the last ten years?</p>
<p><em>“You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Stardew Valley - Gameplay Trailer | PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8A7A1X1TVNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And finally we have the excellent Psychonauts 2 which was released on Xbox back in 2021 with the PS4 version arriving in 2023. Rather than explain what the game is about, why not watch our handy video review! Spoiler: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/23/psychonauts-2-review/">It’s great we gave it 9/10</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Psychonauts 2 Review (Xbox Series X)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1u6JKe9j3Yo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Can you still get the August 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 1st September to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lies of P</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>DayZ</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>My Hero One’s Justice 2</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/august-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-lies-of-p/">Head here for the full skinny </a>on that.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/765883a9dbb65/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you've been living in the deepest, darkest cave imaginable, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is <em>finally</em> launching next week, on 4th September 2025. Fans have been waiting years to get their hands on the sequel to the critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, and suddenly, we have just over a week to go.</p>
<p>Team Cherry has sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-has-now-sold-almost-15-million-copies">almost 15 million copies of its hit hand-drawn Metroidvania</a>, but there are still many out there who have yet to dive into Hallownest.</p>
<p>Some have likely bought the game and just never tried it, while others have played a little bit and fallen off. Or, Silksong's announcement might have pushed a handful of people to finally pick up it. Incredibly, the game reached a record number of CCUs (concurrently connected users) on Steam following Silksong's Release Trailer — over <em>eight years</em> since its original release.</p>

<p>We imagine a good chunk of players are those revisiting the game, but that's still an impressive figure. Here at Nintendo Life, editor Gavin Lane has finally started his long trek through the bug world, while this writer here is <em>strongly</em> considering a quick third playthrough, or perhaps even an elusive P5 clear.</p>
<p>Essentially, the hype for Silksong has a bunch of people doing some homework, either seeing what the fuss is all about or refreshing their memories. Has it got you hankering for some tough boss fights and exploration?</p>
<p><em>Let us know how you're preparing for Silksong by voting in our poll below — is this your first time playing Hollow Knight? Are you dipping back in for a second time? Third? Fourth? Tell us!</em></p>

              <p><span>I want to like </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/office-spin-off-first-look-the-paper-nbc-peacock-teaser-1851780331"><i><span>Office </span></i><span>spin-off premiering on Peacock</span></a><span> next month, but it sure knows how to make a bad impression. The show’s first trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-office-paper-trailer-peacock-release-date-oscar-2000616348"><span>miraculously devoid of jokes</span></a><span>, but I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and hope that its true brilliance would shine in sequences too long to come through clearly if shoved into a two-minute teaser. Well, we now have our first clip of the show, and unfortunately </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>continues to come across like the work of people trying desperately to emulate </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> without understanding what made it work.</span></p> <p><span>The scene Peacock put out today shows Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), the new editor-in-chief for the </span><i><span>Toledo Truth-Teller</span></i><span>, trying to impress people on the newspaper’s office floor by looking like he and his staff are having a very enthusiastic meeting in one of the private rooms. Important people are watching, and Ned wants them to think that things are going swimmingly and that the team is energized and synergized. But instead of just actually having a meeting, he instructs his employees to pantomime a productive one so the suits outside will think he’s running a productive ship.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As unfunny as it is, it works. Good for him. I hope he can follow up that content meeting with actual content. But what is the joke here? </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>had absurd sequences that lasted long enough to be uncomfortable, but they were laced with one-liners, had pointed criticism of its office of assholes, or at least made you cringe from second-hand embarrassment. This whole charade doesn’t go anywhere. It’s just a couple of people being confused, most of the group playing along, and a suit being successfully hoodwinked. No punchline.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Paper | New Series Sneak Peek | Peacock Original" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbuaBS3LtWA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>’s 10-episode season premieres next week on September 4, and I really hope that Peacock is just holding back the good stuff. I don’t need the spin-off to be exactly the same as the original, but it would be nice if it didn’t feel so sauceless. </span></p>

But this isn't just going to be Friday the 13th: The Game swapping out Jason Vorhees for Michael Myers. For one, the announcement confirms that Halloween will be both a single-player and multiplayer horror experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Although Friday the 13th did technically feature single-player content, these were essentially challenge missions that featured no narrative. Sitting down with design director Jordan Mathewson, he explains that this is very much a story mode experience that the studio is working on with Pollard Studio, the Shanghai-based studio behind Karma: The Dark World. "It does have narrative and cinematic components to really give it a lot of story and exploration into what it is doing," he says. "But we've also been building a lot and iterating in a way that allows us to build a type of experience that stands apart from multiplayer and give you a completely different look at what this type of game can be."</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, apart from the announcement trailer, there has been no further reveal of the gameplay--not even behind closed doors--and so it's still too early to have a clear idea of what to expect from Halloween's story mode, apart from that it will put you in the boots and behind the mask of Michael Myers. But from what I'm able to learn from Matthewson, it sounds deliciously like a serial killer's version of Hitman.</p><p dir="ltr">As Halloween will be using the 1978 movie as its blueprint, that means the setting is in the sleepy rural and suburban town of Haddonfield, Illinois. "All the decorations, the characters, the clothing are all from the 1970s," he explains. "It's been a lot of fun exploring what that means, and everything that comes with having that kind of technology back then when it comes to actually making the single-player is a big portion of this compared to our previous titles."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Haddonfield may have you just thinking of the iconic suburban neighborhood, its grounded and familiar setting being what elevates the horror when a terrifying killer is let loose in it, Matthewson also assures me that there will be a variety of maps that go beyond that neighborhood. "There's a lot more to Haddonfield that you see throughout the movie that we'll be exploring and making sure there's different types of maps that have different sizes and different types of play styles associated, so it does lend itself to different experiences as you get set on these different maps."</p><p dir="ltr">Having what sounds like large sandbox maps is going to be crucial to Halloween's more slow-paced and stealth-based gameplay. Whereas Friday the 13th boiled down to Jason trying to kill as many counselors as possible within a time limit, Halloween's Haddonfield isn't just a map but a simulation of '70s suburbia, so there will be a lot of NPCs also going about their own routines on Halloween night. The twist is that any one of these can be targets for Myers.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the Agent 47 comparison comes into play, as Myers needs to bide his time, observing an NPC, staying in the shadows, until the opportune moment to kill comes. What this means is that rather than playing as targets trying to escape, the goal of other players is to prevent the massacre from occurring by rescuing the targeted townsfolk, such as convincing them to leave their homes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very stealthy on both sides since Michael of course doesn't want to be seen and he has a more methodical approach, but the civilians are obviously trying to stay out of sight until they have the means to try and combat him," explains Matthewson. Just as it is that assassinating a target out in the open can have everyone coming after you in Hitman, so too it seems that Michael's massacre can be more difficult to pull off if he gives himself away. It will also be possible for the civilian players to escalate things. "You can try to call the cops and convince them there's a murderer on the loose. If the cops come to investigate and start finding evidence, they'll send more and more that create a much more difficult challenge for Michael. He's very powerful, but at the same time, the authority figures will challenge him."</p><p dir="ltr">But without seeing this in action, I can't quite picture in my head how this plays out. Is the bogeyman seriously going to be deterred by a bunch of smalltown cops? If Michael Myers is such a foreboding presence, I also can't imagine his stealth options are going to involve crouching in a bush, but if not then how does he stay stealthy? And given that this game is sticking to just the 1978 movie, which was arguably his most grounded depiction, does that limit the kind of powers he will have when facing both other players as well the rest of the town?</p><p dir="ltr">Alas, those are details we'll have to wait for Illfonic to reveal at a later date. Nonetheless, Matthewson assures me that the studio has been doing a lot of research and working directly with IP holder Compass to explore what Michael is truly capable of. "It retains that grounded nature because it is meant to exist in a reality where you feel vulnerable and you feel like you're in a familiar setting," he says. "It's been really fun to explore that side of it, and making sure we stick to it but then also getting to jump back to Michael's perspective and expand on it in a way that makes it a really interesting, fun, powerful experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Halloween will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

                <p>Supermassive Games has already proven itself as one of the most popular storytellers in interactive cinematic horror--since Until Dawn's release a decade ago, more than half a dozen similar titles that focus on different monsters have been released. Directive 8020 is the latest of these as part of its anthology series The Dark Pictures, and sees the developer charting new territory in space.</p><p dir="ltr">Alien is one major cornerstone, the film that really showed us how terrifying space can be, while you also play as a crew on board the ship Casseopeia who are due to awake from cryosleep. There's even a touch of 2001: A Space Odyssey, given the presence of a talking supercomputer called Oracle, though playing through the first episode, I don't have enough reason to be suspicious. The grave threat instead is a meteorite that's breached the ship's hull, which has also brought some kind of alien fleshy matter on board that can mimic the appearance of the crew. This is essentially The Thing in space.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Supermassive Game Directive 8020 Pulls Inspiration From The Thing</p>
      </div>
<p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibY6uKgpvw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ibY6uKgpvw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While that will no doubt open up to paranoia among the crew when you're going to question who is or isn't human, at this point the ship only has two monitoring crew up and about, Tomas Carter and Sims, so when the latter suddenly starts behaving murderously aggressive, it's no surprise that something's not right.</p><p dir="ltr">The formula for Supermassive's interactive horror typically involves making choices and reacting to quicktime events, with the occasionally awkward moments of actually controlling a character in third-person. But given that there are times you're going to be hunted, creative director Will Doyle explains that this has meant that Directive 8020's control systems couldn't just follow on from its past Dark Pictures titles.</p><p dir="ltr">"The way the character moves, and the way the camera works [has been] rebuilt from the ground up, and that's to support some of the stealth gameplay that we've put in," he explains. "We've got these real-time threats, who will hunt you down and kill you. So that complete overhaul is new to this game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the same time, a more traditional third-person adventure format also allows for more exploration and puzzles, as you can turn on a flashlight to navigate the creepy, dark corridors of the ship, and also have a scanner that's used for interacting with certain objects. I'm not fully convinced that these sections of gameplay will prove enjoyable--when I play a cinematic horror game, it just feels plodding to be walking around and handling very mundane interactions that any good film editor would have left on the cutting-room floor. It also doesn't help that the build I played also had some awkward moments when the prompt wouldn't come up if you were standing too close to an object--a bug the team had already warned me about in advance.</p><p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, Doyle insists that this is intentional in the game's design philosophy. "A lot of traditional action-adventure games have these design loops where you're getting ammunition, and we see story as the reward in those loops," he explains. "We have a load of stuff hidden around the world, but they're advancing the story all the time. So within our discovery sections, where you're moving around in control of your character, as well as evading threats, you're also unraveling pieces of this mystery, so the story gets driven throughout."</p><p dir="ltr">However, the new mechanic that intrigues me the most is Turning Points, which essentially breaks down every narrative decision into a story beat that you can not only chart on a menu screen but also return to. In past games, when a decision occurs or a character dies, the story continues and there's no way to undo it. While this way of playing the game still remains in Survivor mode for those who want to live and die by their decisions, I also wondered if the ability to rewind is due to there being more direct character control that can lead to potentially more frustrating mistakes, especially for a more casual audience not used to playing with a controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Doyle recalls that there have been players of the studio's past games who have actually stopped playing when a favorite character died because they couldn't be bothered with trying again. And while he admits that Turning Points alleviate this frustration, and helps make the game more approachable for a player worried about their skill level, he says the mechanic is really there to enhance the game for narrative-focused players. Meanwhile, a range of accessibility settings also allow you to effectively reduce the enemy AI to a ghost-themed train ride, where they may be scary but won't ever catch or kill you.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Turning Points are] a save system, but within each individual beat, you can go back to characters who are alive or dead based on decisions made," he explains. "If you rewind to a decision point, you can explore different paths. You can pass anywhere you've been in the story. So when you see the [narrative] tree, you can explore all the way down on the tree. We want people to play the game however they want to play."</p><p dir="ltr">So rather than a rewind mechanic like say, Max's power in Life Is Strange, it's actually better to think of Turning Points as more like a fast-travel system in a narrative game, and a more elegant way to explore different decision paths than save-scumming.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can rewind all the way back as far as you want to go, so even at the end of the game, I can jump right back to any point," Doyle adds, and it's here that the system feels like it's going to be the most beneficial for both completionists who want to comb through every secret or piece of content in the game without having to replay from start to finish. Think of it like being able to skip to any chapter of a DVD, but a lot more interactive. "For [Trophy/Achievement] hunters, there's still a challenge to seeing everything, but the Turning Points [allow] you to whizz back to where you need to get to make those changes. And that's kind of the magic of what we do."</p><p dir="ltr">Directive 8020 releases for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

These are buffs and tweaks to each character’s abilities that the player chooses between over the course of a match. Cassidy, the gunslingin’ cowboy of the roster, has a pretty packed season between his new fire-based mythic weapon and being the face of the </span><a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1960039614049059292"><span>Luka Dončić collaboration event</span></a><span>, but his greatest boon is that his new perk is absolutely busted.</span></p> <p><span>One of Cassidy’s new perks is called Silver Bullet, and it replaces his rapid-fire “Fan the Hammer” secondary fire with a piercing shot that inflicts Bleed on its target. So not only does it shoot through enemies, but it inflicts damage over time on them as well. You can also zoom in when using it for more precision, which is always helpful for a hitscan hero. Its cooldown resets when you use his dodge roll, so you can pop these suckers off in rapid succession and do some real damage. Combine it with his mythic weapon Blazing Sun and you’ve got a fireworks show going on over the payload. However, it looks like it might be busted, as players found that if you press both primary and secondary fire at the same time, the damage is doubled.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So there is a bug with silver bullet that if you aim it and like instantly cancel it with roll and shoot in quick succession it does like double the damage it's supposed to <a href="https://t.co/QyNcbfmSQk">pic.twitter.com/QyNcbfmSQk</a></p> <p>— Kaladin (@KaladinMeow) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaladinMeow/status/1960502342706717042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Fans are calling this latest patch one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s buggiest, but I guess when you’re overhauling a system like Perks there’s bound to be stuff that falls through the cracks. Wrecking Ball, the mech-piloting hamster tank, has been temporarily removed from standard play while Blizzard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1n0ylfz/comment/navcxot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>fixes a game-breaking bug</span></a><span> that gave him too much momentum when moving while grappled to an object, and Hazard is able to use his block ability forever, rather than having to stop for a cooldown as he’s supposed to.</span></p>    <p><span>As indicated by the comments on @mi7supp’s video above, some players are reporting issues with Venture and Ashe as well. Hopefully Blizzard will have these squashed in the coming days. While it’s not a great start to the season, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has a lot going on in season 18, including a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-persona-collaboration-skins-joker-2000619195"><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span> that will add new skins and cosmetics based on Atlus’ high school social sim RPGs.</span></p>

<p>Stardew Valley got a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/19/stardew-valley-16-patch-drops-today-heres-what-to-expect">substantial 1.6 update last year</a>, so if you haven't played it in a while, you'll be greeted by some new features, including new dialogue, new crafting recipes, hats for pets, and, for some reason, the ability to drink mayonnaise. I don't know who's out there saying, "I'd love to play Stardew Valley, but it's a deal breaker that you can't drink mayo straight from the jar," but if that's you, you're in luck.</p><p>The other two games are nothing to sneeze at either. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/psychonauts-2/psychonauts-2-review-well-worth-the-wait">Psychonauts 2 scored a nine from us</a> when it released back in 2021 and even made its way onto <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2021">our top ten list from that year</a>. It's the long awaited sequel to Double Fine's platformer from 2005, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/07/05/the-history-of-double-fine-productions">we did a retrospective on the studio's history</a> back when it was featured on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/magazine-archive/336-psychonauts-2">the cover of Game Informer issue 336</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/viewfinder/short-and-smart">Viewfinder is a delightful puzzle game</a> from 2023 that reminds me of Portal in the best way – its photographic puzzle solving is incredibly creative game design.</p><p>All three games will be available for subscribers on September 2.

<p>The director of Elden Ring’s film adaptation may be a bigger fan than we thought, given his script size. A recent article from The New Yorker sheds some insight as to how the upcoming A24 film came to be. Even more so, it does hint that the film may be in the right hands after all.</p>



<p>Winner of multiple Game of the Year awards in 2022, Elden Ring was a hit for Bandai Namco and FromSoftware. The intense gameplay and insane difficulty, much like the studio’s Dark Souls series, kept fans playing and is still regarded as one of director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s best. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-movie-finally-confirmed-by-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a film adaptation was announced</a> from indie studio A24 and director Alex Garland. The filmmaker, known for Ex Machina and 28 Days Later, was an interesting choice given the game’s scope. However, we may actually be in luck if Garland’s obsession is true.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an article on A24 from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/01/a24s-empire-of-auteurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The New Yorker</a>, head of film Noah Sacco chatted with Alex Barasch about the studio. While talking about it’s upcoming big blockbusters, Sacco mentions meeting with Alex Garland five years ago. Previously, the director did Ex Machina, Civil War, and Warfare with A24. While there, Garland showed off Elden Ring on PlayStation to Sacco and asked if they could adapt it for the studio. When Sacco agreed, Garland proceeded to write a 160-page script, alongside 40 illustrations, for his version of Elden Ring. The two flew out to Japan once it was done and showed it off to FromSoftware and director Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>



<p>As you can tell, the deal went well and now the film is greenlit, with many original contributors like Game of Thrones’ George R.R Martin producing. Interestingly enough, this is the second video game film that A24 will produce. Death Stranding, directed by A Quiet Place: Day One’s Michael Sarnoski, is in the works. Regardless, given Alex Garland’s enthusiasm for Elden Ring, the film may turn out to be better than other game film adaptations.</p>



<p>Are you excited about A24’s Elden Ring adaptation? Do you think Garland is the right choice to direct? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics, the studio behind the recent Tomb Raider games and a co-developer of the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot, has announced that it was holding layoffs.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, the studio said it <strong>“made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions.”</strong></p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics says that the decision <strong>“was not made lightly”</strong>, but was one that it says was needed to <strong>“ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“To those impacted – we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion,”</strong> they said.<strong> “We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as the future of Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics says that it’s development is unaffected by the moves.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Crystal Dynamics for more context surrounding the layoffs, exactly how many people were being let go, and if the recent cancellation of Perfect Dark had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded,</em></a> the newly released remaster of the original <em>Gears of War</em>, has a low review score on Steam due to crashes and missing split-screen support. This follows a day-one patch that was supposed to fix a number of bugs and crashes on both console and PC.</p> <p>On August 26, Xbox launched <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>–a remastered version o<em>f Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, itself a remaster of <em>Gears of War-</em>-on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and for the first time in franchise history, PlayStation, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-remastered-reloaded-running-ps5-xbox-weird-2000620092">a leap it made via a PS5 port.</a> And the game is totally fine if you want to replay<em> Gears of War</em> again. But on PC, players are encountering some annoying issues and are upset about the lack of split-screen. Meanwhile, the Xbox port has a weird FPS bug, and I’ve experienced some issues on PS5, too.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded’</em>s user review score on Steam sits at 49 percent</a> as of 1 p.m. EST on August 27. That’s not great! Checking out the reviews, it seems a big issue with this new remastered shooter is that it crashes a lot for some folks. What’s odd is that some players claim that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was running fine shortly after launch, but has started crashing more since then. One fix floating around online involves deleting a specific folder and not connecting to Xbox Live, which seems to imply there might be some server shenanigans happening. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-reloaded-hammered-in-steam-reviews-for-missing-splitscreen-co-op-and-microsoft-accounts-seemingly-crashing-everyones-fun-including-mine/#:~:text=I%20ended%20up%20refunding%20it%20on%20Steam%2C%20renewing%20my%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass%20sub%2C%20and%20redownloading%20the%20game%20through%20the%20Xbox%20PC%20app.%20This%20version%20of%20the%20remaster%20has%20performed%20fine%20for%20me%20for%20a%20few%20hours%20now%2C%20suggesting%20there%20is%20genuinely%20something%20wrong%20with%20the%20Steam%20version."><em>Gamesradar</em> reports that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a> works fine when downloaded and installed via the Xbox PC Game Store, suggesting that the version on Steam, or at least how it connects to Xbox servers, might not be working properly.</p>

 <p>Other players report that changing the game’s graphical settings leads to frequent crashing. I’ll say that on PS5, I ran into two crashes and some weird performance problems as well. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/08/digital-foundry-praises-gears-reloaded-on-xbox-but-points-out-glitch-with-the-120fps-mode"><em>Digital Foundry</em> also reports</a> that there’s an odd FPS bug on Xbox Series X that causes the campaign to improperly run at a not-so-stable 120FPS. I also ran into weird FPS issues on PS5 and had to turn off VRR. The PC port also lacks an FOV slider and has some weird limits on keybinding.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The team is investigating crashes on Steam when launching the game and missing pre-order character skins for some users, as well as initial reports of matchmaking issues.</p> <p>You can see all known issues by going to <a href="https://t.co/LNNEO2vf0H">https://t.co/LNNEO2vf0H</a></p> <p>Thank you for your patience.</p> <p>— Gears Community (@Community_Gears) <a href="https://twitter.com/Community_Gears/status/1960483079082139975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/gearsofwar/status/1960084806831608233?s=46">A day-one patch was supposed to iron a lot of this out</a>, but it doesn’t seem to have completely worked. As a result, <a href="https://x.com/Community_Gears/status/1960483079082139975">Xbox and The Coalition posted on social media</a> on Tuesday that the team is currently “investigating” the PC crashes and reports of online matchmaking errors, as well as an issue in which people who pre-ordered did not receive the cosmetics they were promised for doing so. Keep in mind, this is a remaster of a 10-year-old remaster. It’s wild to me that<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> seemingly shipped in such a wonky state.</p> <p>Another reason for the game’s low rating on Steam is that players thought<em> Gears of War: Reloaded</em> would support split-screen co-op on PC. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitscreen/comments/1kg674q/gears_of_war_reloaded_pc_split_screen_confirmed/">Split-screen was reportedly listed on the game’s official Steam store page</a>. There’s also evidence that split-screen co-op support was mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1n0t0ud/the_pc_version_of_reloaded_is_still_under_cooked/"><em>Reloaded’s</em> Steam page trailer</a>. But it appears all mentions of split-screen support have since been removed. My guess is that this was a mistake and Xbox never intended to add split-screen to PC. Regardless, it’s just one more reason PC players are disappointed with <em>Gears of War: Reloaded.</em></p>

<p>Konami has publicly addressed a number of launch issues for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that have been reported by players.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Komani says that it has <strong>“received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them.” </strong></p>



<p>The issues all center around game crashes and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>



<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>



<p>Konami doesn’t have a specific timeline for a release for the update, but says that it will “take a little longer to implement the fixes” as they investigate the causes.</p>



<p><strong>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,”</strong> they said.</p>

<p>Hot off Gamescom, Silent Hill f has officially revealed the English voice cast. In it, there are plenty of RPG heavyweights, as well as some promising new actors. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f, the next entry in the acclaimed horror franchise, takes players to Japan. You play as Hinako, a high school student who’s town is now shrouded in an eerie fog. While it doesn’t take place in the town of Silent Hill like previous games, you’ll still encounter disgusting monsters and deadly situations. As the eight mainline title after 2012’s Silent Hill: Downpour, the series may be on it’s way to claim the horror crown again. Luckily, they have some great voice actors along with them on the journey.</p>

<li>Caleb Yen as <strong>Fox Mask</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The most notable of the bunch is <strong>Suzie Yeung</strong>, who was confirmed last week at Gamescom Opening Night Live.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Judas’ creative director Ken Levine has broken Ghost Story Games’ silence on the state of the game, offering the a new look at how the game is shaping up. Instead of waiting months between trailers and “fancy imagery”, Levine says these “lo-fi” updates will give players more frequent insights into development while the team keeps its main focus on finishing the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-judas-villainy-and-relationship-system">Judas’ Villainy And Relationship System</h3>



<p>One of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the biggest updates</a> comes in the form of a new feature called Villainy. Unlike BioShock or BioShock Infinite, where the antagonist was fixed, Judas will let players determine who the villains are. The game’s “Big 3” characters can be drawn to the player as friends and allies, but if ignored, they may turn into enemies. </p>



<p><strong>“From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals,”</strong> Levine says.</p>



<p>The update also reinforced the game’s focus on character-driven storytelling. Inspired partly by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System, Judas aims to take things deeper by making relationships with the Big 3 emotionally meaningful. Characters will try to earn the player’s trust through bribes, saving them in fights, gossiping about rivals, or even sharing secrets. Losing one of them is meant to feel like losing a friend.</p>



<p>In contrast to BioShock Infinite’s Elizabeth, who players came to know well but who didn’t really know the player, the Big 3 in Judas will actively observe your actions. They’ll react to how you handle combat, crafting, hacking, and especially how you treat the others.</p>



<p>As for when players can get their hands on Judas, the team isn’t ready to commit. While development is moving forward and milestones are being hit, the studio says it wants to avoid announcing a release date that could slip. </p>



<p><strong>“But we know Judas is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward,”</strong> he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest Silent Hill movie is blazing its own trail.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Christophe Gans’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/return-to-silent-hill"><u>Return to Silent Hill</u></a> is hitting theaters in January 2026, just in time for the 20th anniversary of the original Silent Hill movie. This is good news, given that Silent Hill still ranks as one of the better video game movie adaptations to date. 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation? Not so much. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cineverse just released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-teaser-trailer-revealed-for-third-movie-based-on-konami-game-franchise"><u>a short first teaser for Return to Silent Hill</u></a>, offering a glimpse of the many horrors Jeremy Irvine’s James Sunderland will face as he navigates the town in search of his missing wife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that so much time has passed since Gans last set foot in the moody town of Silent Hill, you might be wondering how this sequel is connected to its predecessors. Is it a direct continuation of Silent Hill and Silent Hill: Revelations? Which game is it adapting? Here’s everything you need to know before Return to Silent Hill hits theaters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Return to Silent Hill Connects to the Other Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2006’s Silent Hill stars Radha Mitchell as Rose Da Silva, a woman who brings her adopted daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the remote, abandoned town of Silent Hill in order to get to the bottom of Sharon’s recurring nightmares. Sean Bean also stars as Rose’s husband Christopher, who attempts to rescue his family even as they become trapped in a hellish other dimension. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite featuring a different director and writer in M.J. Bassett, 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation serves as a direct sequel to the first movie. Adelaide Clemens stars as the adult Sharon, now assuming the identity of Heather Mason. When her father disappears in Silent Hill, Heather and her classmate Vincent (Kit Harington) return to the town to find him. Revelation also deals heavily with the religious cult known as the Order of Valtiel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is not a direct follow-up to either of those films. Instead, this film is telling a standalone story with a different set of characters. Return to Silent Hill stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, a widower who is stunned to receive a letter from his dead wife Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson), urging him to meet her in Silent Hill. James will descend deeper and deeper into the otherworldly dimensions of the town in order to find her. Silent Hill 2 Remake’s Evie Templeton will reprise her role as Laura, a young girl also caught in the web that is Silent Hill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, it seems you don’t necessarily need to have seen the other Silent Hill movies in order to enjoy Return to Silent Hill. This sequel follows the approach of the games in that the spooky town itself, not the characters, provides most of the connective tissue. Most of the games aren’t directly intertwined by plot, but instead focus on different characters being drawn into the town and finding their personal demons manifesting into literal monsters. The series is not unlike Hellraiser in that regard, as the Hellraiser movies are mostly standalone horror stories linked together by the overarching mythology of Pinhead and the Cenobites. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The script for a new Silent Hill movie that is totally independent from the two previous movies made and respects the way Silent Hill has evolved,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-new-movie-2023"><u>Gans said in 2022</u></a>. “Silent Hill is a bit like Twilight Zone, the Fourth Dimension, a place where anything and everything can happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill 2 (2024) Review Screens</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Which Games Does Return to Silent Hill Adapt?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If the description of Return to Silent Hill’s plot sounds familiar, it should. This film happens to be a direct adaptation of the Silent Hill 2 game, which was originally released in 2001 and remade in 2024. Just like this film, Silent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland as he navigates the various dimensions of the town in search of his late wife. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill looks to be the most faithful adaptation of the game out of the three films to date, to the point that Gans went to the trouble of casting Templeton as Laura again. We assume the film will follow the core beats of the game, pitting James against terrifying monsters like Pyramid Head and culminating in a similarly tragic twist ending. Pyramid Head himself can be seen in the teaser, making him the one character confirmed to appear in all three films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither of the previous Silent Hill movies could be considered more than loose adaptations of the source material. The first Silent Hill film may borrow liberally from the imagery and music of the series, along with a few basic plot points from 1999’s Silent Hill, but its plot and cast of characters are largely unique. Silent Hill: Revelation is sort of an adaptation of the Silent Hill 3 game, transforming Rose and Christopher Da Silva into Heather and Harry Mason. But, again, the less said about Revelation, the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Direct adaptation or not, it doesn’t appear that Return to Silent Hill will be a 1:1 copy of Silent Hill 2. Gans has hinted the film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240506195503/https://www.ecranlarge.com/films/dossier/1435959-le-pacte-des-loups-silent-hill-christophe-gans-pionnier-du-blockbuster-a-la-francaise" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>also draws inspiration from 2014’s P.T.</u></a>, the infamous demo that was meant to lead into Hideo Kojima’s canceled Silent Hills game. Does that mean the film will feature first-person sequences, a la 2005’s Doom? Or is the P.T. influence more in terms of the steadily mounting sense of dread and psychological horror? We’ll find out when Return to Silent Hill hits theaters in January 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Return to Silent Hill, find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hills-first-cinematic-trailer-has-completely-divided-the-community"><u>why the teaser trailer has divided the Silent Hill fan community</u></a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

While you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, fans said it looked like you wouldn’t be able to fly <em>all the way</em> between systems. And it looks like you won’t be able to fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">References to the new offering, referred to in the game's code as "Cruise Mode," were detected by players and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1mii922/new_findings_in_the_last_2_update_suggest_dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reddit</u></a>, though Bethesda reportedly issued another small patch to scrub them from view.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video discussing his career</a>, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio has been working on Starfield’s space gameplay, and that a new DLC story is still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,” he said. “We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-breaks-silence-on-starfield-future-promises-to-share-details-on-exciting-things-in-the-coming-months"><u>Bethesda said it had "exciting things" coming to Starfield soon</u></a> — presumably referring to this. However, Starfield was a no-show at gamescom 2025 last week, prompting further fan concern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously talked of expansions arriving annually</u></a>, but perhaps Bethesda sees the addition of some form of spaceflight as something to keep players occupied until then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more generally about the development of Starfield, Lamb described it as “like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have your, I'm running around shooting aliens and space guys,” he said. “You have your, I'm flying around in a spaceship, shooting other spaceships. You have the ship builder game. You have the outpost game. Starfield to me was like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/bioshock-creators-ghost-story-games-reveals-first-title-judas">Judas was formally revealed during The Game Awards 2022</a> as the next game from BioShock creator Ken Levine and his studio, Ghost Story Games. Since then, the team has remained mostly silent, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">save for a gameplay trailer last year,</a> on what it's been up to with this sci-fi shooter (that looks a lot like BioShock). However, Levine took to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">PlayStation Blog</a> to share new details about the game's Big 3, villainy system, and the Judas key art.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking inspiration from famed Star Wars poster illustrator Drew Struzan, the Judas key art features the protagonist up front and center, seemingly overshadowing what I think is a variant of her (presumably alluding to the way choices can affect the narrative of the game, though it could just be a totally different character), above the Big 3: Queen Nefertiti, Sheriff Tom Austin, and Hope Jimenez. Levine teases there's more to glean from this key art, so I'll leave you to it:&nbsp;</p>










<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c2a35418-253f-4baf-9a27-dcb207a5e607" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

	






</article>
<p>Alongside this key art, Levine has shared that Ghost Story Games has just finished a major milestone it calls "Villainy." The director writes that villainy is a central feature of Judas, and that your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends, or turn them into foes. "When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain," Levine writes in the blog. "Fontaine, Comstock – they're always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the <em>villain</em>. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals."&nbsp;</p><p>The included clip in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">blog post</a> shows a Rent-a-Deputy robotic horse, which can attack enemies for you once rented, turning against you at the hands of Big 3 member, Sheriff Tom Austin. Levine says this is just a small way a Big 3 friend-turned-foe can make your life on the Mayflower, the spaceship setting of Judas, harder.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In the blog, Levine continues, explaining Ghost Story Games wants players to get to know the Big 3 intimately, and wants losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. The Big 3 will be competing for your favor and attention through Judas – they can bribe you, save you in battle, badmouth the other two Big 3 members, and share with you their deepest secrets. But, as Levine points out, eventually, you have to decide who you trust and who you don't... and that's going to cause problems.&nbsp;</p><p>"In BioShock Infinite, there was a lot of energy invested into developing your relationship with Elizabeth," Levine writes. "By the end of the game, you knew everything about her, her abilities, her hopes, and dreams. But the truth is she knew almost nothing about you, the gamer playing Booker. In Judas, the Big 3 observe you as you play, and they have feelings not only about how you approach combat, hacking, and crafting, but most importantly, your interactions with the other two characters."&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, today's blog doesn't include a release date or window for Judas as Ghost Story Games doesn't want to say when its game will launch until it's confident in a date it can hold. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/new-report-details-bioshock-creators-new-game-and-the-rocky-development-employee-burnout">Considering Levine's release track record</a>, Judas could still be years away (but hopefully it isn't).&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/bioshock-creators-ghost-story-games-reveals-first-title-judas">watch the Judas reveal trailer</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">check out the Judas gameplay trailer shown last year</a>. After that, read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/what-we-want-from-bioshock-4">what we want from BioShock 4</a>, which isn't being developed by Ken Levine but is in the works at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2019/12/09/2k-announces-new-studio-for-the-next-bioshock">newcomer studio Cloud Chamber</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Judas' Big 3 villainy system?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ken-levine%E2%80%99s-ghost-story-games-shows-off-new-judas-art-but-no-release-date-update.1282335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost Story Games, the studio founded by BioShock director Ken Levine and currently working on a very BioShock-esque-looking game, Judas, just <a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">published a developer blog for the first time</a> in the game's more than a decade-long conceptual and development production period. The update provides a few details about one of the game's core features, and shows off some impressive key art, but it does not provide any kind of update as to the game's release date.</p>



<p>We got our very first proper look at Judas last <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/">March</a>, and since then, Ghost Story Games has been about as quiet as it was for the last decade. Though in fairness, Judas has been an idea floating in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/">Levine's mind since 2015</a>, and Ghost Story Games was only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-story-games">founded</a> from the rubble of Irrational Games in 2017.</p>



<p>Still, it feels weird and surprising to read "<em>Dev Log #1</em>" at the top of the post for a game that we've been hearing about for years. At least it features a few interesting tidbits about what to expect in Judas, namely around the game's core feature called Villainy.</p>



<p>"<em>Villainy is a central feature of </em><em>Judas</em>. When you play <em>BioShock</em> or <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock — they’re always going to be the bad guys," the post reads. "<em>In </em><em>Judas</em>, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the VILLAIN. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals."</p>



<p>The post also digs into how Judas takes a good deal of inspiration from Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its Nemesis System. But before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monoliths-shadow-of-mordor-nemesis-system-patent-doesnt-expire-for-another-decade/1100-6529722/">Warner Bros fires up its legal team</a>, the post is quick to point out that what Levine and the Ghost Story Games team have made for Judas is a system that is accomplishing different goals, particularly around how you'll interact with the three core characters referred to as 'The Big Three,' which is Tom, Hope, and Nefertiti.</p>



<p>"<em>In </em><em>Judas</em>, you're going to get to know these characters <em>intimately</em>. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you've got to decide who you trust and who you don't."</p>



<p>Ghost Story Games also revealed that it has just completed a playtest for its Villainy feature, which was another major milestone in the game's development, before closing the post by making it clear that the studio won't be announcing a release date until it is sure that it will hit said date.</p>



<p>"<em>While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that. As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it. But we know </em><em>Judas</em> is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward."</p>



<p>Earlier this month, it seemed like Ghost Story Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-mafia-the-old-country-is-a-wonderful-premium-title-seems-to-confirm-judas-for-2026/">confirmed</a> that Judas will arrive sometime in 2026. Hopefully, that is the case, and we can finally wrap up this decade-long journey from BioShock Infinite to Judas. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, and oddly enough, it doesn't sound like BioShock 4 will be as lucky, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">might not be arriving until 2027</a> as its development troubles only seem to keep piling up. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-awkwardly-mixes-modern-visuals-with-old-school-frustrations.1282332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> seemed to be designed specifically for me, at first. I’ve played and loved nearly every entry of the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series, and the original <em>MGS</em> is one of my favorite games of all time. These weird, third-person stealth action games feature bizarre characters and scenarios that have lingered in my memories through a consistent mixture of intricate political espionage and ridiculous action sequences. The only entry that I never managed to play was <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>.</p><p><em>Delta</em> is a modern remake of <em>MGS3 </em>that uses the same levels, cutscenes, voice lines, and performances, making it ideal for those who adored the earlier entries. Sadly, after hours of play, <em>Delta</em> often left me frustrated. You play as a more novice version of one of the series’ protagonists, Naked Snake, who is completely unequipped to deal with the scenarios before him. This makes sense from a story perspective, but it left me feeling as though I was playing with one hand tied behind my back. I also did not have the benefit of nostalgia to see me through this fog of annoyance.</p><p>Despite its incredible visuals, this is not an overhaul to the extent of recent remakes like <em>Resident Evil 4</em> or <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. This is an almost shot-for-shot remake of the original <em>Snake Eater</em> (to not complicate matters, we won’t discuss the many different versions of <em>Snake Eater</em> and which is the definitive version). This means that you’ll experience it with warts and all.</p><p>You can miss equipment at crucial stages and melee combat works when the game decides (I can hit flying creatures with a torch but I can’t stab a snake with a knife). Healing makes as much sense as reading tea leaves. I could not tell you how or why Snake manages to heal, despite there being an entire mechanic cleverly dedicated to counter broken bones, bullet wounds, and so on. Snake can use a lit cigar to rid himself of leeches or bandages to stop bleeding, but these do not improve health bars so much as stop them from degrading. I don’t know what raises his health bars.</p><p>The game’s structure is part of why it feels dated. The levels are broken up by frequent loading screens that show how small they really are, making me feel like I was moving from one tiny fake set to another, rather than navigating a dense jungle. To be fair, that is how the original game works and, as noted, this is not a bottom-up remake. Nevertheless, these small levels feel at odds with the modern visuals.</p><p>I have no problem learning a game’s systems through trial and error, especially when loading is lightning fast (the PS5’s SSD has no doubt saved many a potential broken controller). But I felt constantly unprepared in <em>Delta</em>. The early hours saw me frequently reloading a level due to a sudden introduction of landmines, a distinct inability to see or detect enemies, and uninspired boss fights. These all threw me off and made me roll my eyes when I had to come back. The game and I were just not clicking. The versions of Snake I saw in cutscenes felt like a different character in my useless hands during gameplay.</p><p>To be clear, Snake feels incredible to control, akin to the Snake in 2015’s <em>Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain</em>, the most recent entry in the series. He responds immediately to controls, directional movements are twitch perfect, and shooting and fighting felt, well, solid. It was also lovely to hear Snake’s English voice being performed by series original David Hayter, whose over-the-top action hero growling once again works perfectly. His performance straddles the line between the ridiculousness of B-grade action flicks and the slick, big-budget productions of a <em>John Wick</em> film.</p><p>Snake does eventually start growing his large arsenal of gadgets and weapons, and learning when and how to use these various gadgets does prove to be part of the joy of the game. But I never felt like I truly understood how and when to use the various gear, which ranges from a weird sonar detector to a crocodile helmet.</p><p>For example, moving through a base near water means you could don a crocodile helmet pretending to be said animal, until you find a ledge, climb on top, and quietly deal with various guards. However, despite wearing the helmet, I was immediately spotted in one instance, bringing a whole level of enemies on top of me. Another area required me to sneak into a base, but it was surrounded by an electric fence and landmines, which proved impossible to spot because I had missed out on a landmine detector earlier in the game.</p><p>Until I obtained thermal goggles, spotting enemies was a nightmare. I found some success by using the game’s remarkable camouflage system (which allows Snake to wear different outfits and body paint to blend into the immediate environment) that renders him almost invisible to enemies. This meant, if I stumbled on an enemy, I had a higher chance of not being immediately spotted.</p><p>The game calls for slow, methodic movement in terrain that can prove hostile, with aforementioned mines, poisonous animals, guard dogs, and so on all trying to find ways to kill you. The game felt more like a collection of puzzles than fully realized environments like in past games, and this structure just never clicked with me.</p><p>The story did, however. It is a delightfully convoluted mess that anyone who has played a <em>Metal Gear</em> game will expect. Snake has been sent to a remote jungle location during the Cold War to stop a Very Big Machine from nuking the world. High-ranking government officials from Russia and the US are vying for power but prove vulnerable to some powerful military offshoot who is trying to take control. There’s backstabbing, twists, and the usual reflection on war, technology, conquest, and the horror of power. Series creator — and the original <em>Snake Eater</em>’s director and writer — Hideo Kojima has been obsessed with these themes for decades. It was actually touching to see his name in the credits and displayed prominently, despite his infamous fallout with Konami.</p><p>Without the benefit of nostalgia, my perspective — that is, someone who is experienced with all the other <em>Metal Gear</em> games but has not touched this one — puts me in a weird space. The gorgeous visuals and eccentric story make it appear like a perfect fit for me. But <em>Delta</em> left me feeling frustrated in its (deliberately designed) helplessness and old-school structure. It left me wanting to be anywhere else rather than in the jungles with that beloved weirdo Snake.</p><p><sub>Metal Gear Sold Delta: Snake Eater <em>launches on August 28th on the PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/766751/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review#comments">2<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/766751/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642">Where is <em>Judas</em></a>? That’s the question <em>BioShock </em>creator Ken Levine keeps getting asked. On Wednesday he took to the PlayStation Blog to tell players he still doesn’t have an answer. “While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that,” he writes, though he does offer some other details.</p> <p>His new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">“lo-fi” dev log</a> explains that<em> Judas</em> has no set villain. NPCs called the “Big 3” will share secrets with you, give you quests, and talk shit about the others. Depending on who you engage with and how, one of characters will be elevated into the game’s main antagonist, unlocking additional powers with which to hamper your journey in the process.</p> <p>“In <em>Judas</em>, you’re going to get to know these characters intimately,” Levine writes. “We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you’ve got to decide who you trust and who you don’t.”</p>

 <figure><figcaption>Credit: Ghost Story Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Ghost Story Games, the studio making <em>Judas</em>, also revealed the game’s key art. It includes the Big 3, killer robots, and ’80s iconography like floppy disks, cassette tapes, and an Atari-esque game stick. Levine confirmed the game recently held a closed playtest and will likely feature over 100 speaking roles by the time it’s complete. He also teased that the key art is intended as more than just an homage to the work of movie poster artist Drew Struzan. “Let’s just say there’s some stuff in this game that we’re not going to talk about right now, but everything here is relevant,” Levine writes.</p> <p>Despite its already lengthy development cycle, with early elements teased as far back as 2015 and a reveal trailer at The Game Awards 2022, <em>Judas</em> seems unlikely to be launching anytime soon. I’d peg it for a fall 2026 release at the earliest, though spring 2027 seems like a better bet. “As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it,” Levine writes.</p> <p>The director’s infamously <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">difficult production style and the high turnover</a> at his current studio probably haven’t helped. Can <em>Judas</em> live up to all of the procedural narrative ambition Levine is promising? Will it still manage to come out before <em>BioShock 4</em>? We still have way more questions than answers.</p>
