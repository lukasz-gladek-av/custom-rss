<p>Call of Duty boasts one of the most popular esports ecosystems in the business. From the Call of Duty League to Challengers, and from the Esports World Cup to the many grassroots events that pop up every year, the competitive scene has plenty of meat on the bones. Many players front the esports landscape, but which of them can be considered the best Call of Duty players around?</p>



<p>In this breakdown, I’ll highlight the top COD pro players you should be watching this year. It’s an ever-changing scene, but the top dogs are usually the same year in, year out – at least until they retire, that is.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about the ten best Call of Duty players in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-best-cod-players">Who Are The Best COD Players?</h2>



<p>As a preface, I’ll highlight that I’m talking <strong>only </strong>about players in the Call of Duty League in this guide. This list won’t touch on the best Warzone players in the business. I’m all about the CDL in this piece!</p>



<p><strong>In no particular order</strong>, let’s talk about the best Call of Duty players in the game <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chris-simp-lehr">Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.8 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Simp is a tried and tested competitor with some of the most stunning achievements in the scene. He was a prodigy who started competing from a young age, breaking into the CWL in 2019 and winning the COD Championship as one of the freshest faces ever to do it.</p>



<p>He went on to win another ring in 2021 after one of the most incredible seasons in the business, showing remarkable domination through the Cold War year. He has flown the Atlanta FaZe banner proudly since 2019 and is one of the most recognisable forces in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Simp’s talents on the sticks are second to none. Time and again, he proves himself to be one of the most technically proficient players in the game, and despite his relatively quiet demeanour, he’s an utter animal with some of the best thumbs in esports.</p>



<p>In 2025, Simp has already claimed a Major chip and a win at the first CDL Minor.</p>



<h3 id="h-thomas-scrappy-ernst">Thomas ‘Scrappy’ Ernst</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$507,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>Scrap entered the Call of Duty League scene as one of the most electrifying, controversial rookies, going on a crusade against some of the biggest and most beloved veterans in the business. The loudmouthed competitor could back up his bark with his bite, though. He quickly established himself as one of the straightest shooters in the game.</p>



<p>In his opening season with Toronto Ultra, Scrap claimed a Major chip and came close to netting a world championship title but was stopped in his tracks by the New York Subliners. Since then, Scrap has earned another chip and wound up in third place at his second COD Champs event.</p>



<p>In 2025, Ernst finds himself occupying a spot on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/">the LA Thieves ‘Super Team’</a>, and he’s already flying in Black Ops 6. He fell ever so slightly short of first place at Major I but has already proven himself as one of the most dominating players and a budding IGL in the 2025 CDL season.</p>



<p>It helps that he has mellowed a bit, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-mcarthur-cellium-jovel">McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.6 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Cellium lives and breathes competitive Call of Duty. As one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, Cellium is the epitome of talent on the sticks, and everything from his movement to his accuracy is top-notch.</p>



<p>Alongside Simp, Cellium has won a COD Champs ring, the top prize at the inaugural Esports World Cup, and has claimed several chips over the last few years. He’s a beloved character with a quirky personality, and his skills are almost unparalleled. </p>



<p>Cellium started strong in 2025, netting a win <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-faze-abezy-cellium-madrid-major/">at the first Major in Madrid</a> <strong>and </strong>the CDL Minor I tournament. With multiple spots as an MVP and an All-Star, Cellium has a stellar record and even more potential to land another ring in the future – perhaps in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro">Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>OpTic Texas</p>



<p>In 2024, Shotzzy went on a burner along with the rest of OpTic Texas, netting a win at Major III and then securing a massive victory at COD Champs, beating the New York Subliners with a 5 – 1 scoreline. That earned Shotzzy his second ring in Call of Duty, following on from his 2020 win with Dallas Empire.</p>



<p>Shotzzy is one of the most popular Call of Duty players around, and his charm and rizz are undeniable. He’s one of the stalwarts of the OpTic Texas roster and is a fan-favourite, but it helps that he’s an animal of the game with some of the best movement in the business.</p>



<p>The OpTic Texas team had a slow start to the 2025 season, which wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/">helped by roster changes</a>, but Shotzzy is very much at home in Black Ops 6, thanks to the ‘omnimovement’ mechanics.</p>



<p>As a side note, Shotzzy has a prestigious place in the world of esports. He’s one of just two pro players in the world to have earned a world championship title in <strong>two games</strong> – Halo and Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-isaiah-gwinn-gwinn">Isaiah ‘Gwinn’ Gwinn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$63,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Carolina Royal Ravens</p>



<p>Gwinn is a stunning prospect and one of the most talented young players in the Call of Duty pro scene. He broke into the Carolina Royal Ravens roster towards the end of 2023 and has been a recognisable face in the squad ever since, but this year, he has blown up.</p>



<p>In terms of numbers, Gwinn has started strong. He ranks high in almost every category – kills, captures, hill time, first bloods, and so on. His talents were a pivotal part of the Royal Ravens seeing immense success early in the season, with the team putting up some of the best numbers right off the bat.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/royal-ravens-on-top-cdl-2025-season/">The Royal Ravens</a> even handed Atlanta FaZe the team’s first 0 – 3 loss in two years.</p>



<p>The dominance persisted into Major I, with Carolina eliminating Vegas, OpTic, and Toronto from the Madrid tournament without too much fuss. It’s a team effort to be sure, but Gwinn is outperforming his teammates, including veteran talents SlasheR and TJHaly, in most respects.</p>



<h3 id="h-zack-drazah-jordan">Zack ‘Drazah’ Jordan</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$903,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Drazah can be a hit-and-miss player at times, but he’s been more hit than miss recently. As one of the cockiest players in the Call of Duty League, Drazah has been forced to put his money where his mouth is on numerous occasions, and sometimes, the trash talk hasn’t paid off – but he’s on a streak right now and it’s working well for him.</p>



<p>At the tail end of the 2022 season, Drazah found his feet, netting the trophy in Major IV and then scooping the COD Championship while representing the LA Thieves. He went on to win Major IV again the next season and then relocated to Atlanta FaZe’s starting roster.</p>



<p>From there, things moved on in earnest for Drazah. The AR who once dubbed himself the best SnD player in the world has since won a further two chips under FaZe, as well as a CDL Minor <strong>and </strong>the Esports World Cup. Flanked by the likes of Cellium, aBeZy, and Simp, Drazah could easily come out on top in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-paco-hydra-rusiewiez">Paco ‘HyDra’ Rusiewiez</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$742,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>HyDra is one of the superstars of the Call of Duty League and has been since he surfaced on the New yok Subliners in 2021, slipping under Clayster’s wing and making a name for himself. He’s known as the ‘French Phenom’ for good reason.</p>



<p>In the years since HyDra entered the Call of Duty League, he has won a Pro-Am, three Major tournaments, and a world championship title. He was a part of the New York Subliners roster that devastated the CDL in 2023, winning two Majors and COD Champs. That COD Champs grand final was <strong>historic</strong>, with the Subliners hitting a 5 – 0 scoreline in record time.</p>



<p>Paco has since joined the LA Thieves and is working as an integral part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/la-thieves-cdl-super-team/">the ‘Super Team’ assembled by Nadeshot</a>. He’s been a little sticky to kick off the CDL 2025 season, but his ceiling is almost unparalleled, and he has some solid players around him.</p>



<p>Last season, HyDra ended up with a second-place finish at Champs, and he’s eager for a redemption story this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-tyler-abezy-pharris">Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.8 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Adding aBeZy to this list means that every member of the Atlanta FaZe squad has made it here, but it <strong>just makes sense</strong>. This team has built up so much chemistry over the years that it’s almost unstoppable, and the wins come thick and fast for the squad.</p>



<p>ABeZy is one of the most dependable Call of Duty players in the CDL, and like Simp, he broke into the competitive scene as a prodigy. With Lehr, Pharris makes up the other half of ‘The Tiny Terrors’ on Atlanta FaZe.</p>



<p>In 2025, aBeZy has already claimed wins at both a Major and a Minor, and in 2024, he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-cod-esports-world-cup/">snatched the Esports World Cup win</a> with ease – plus he added another chip to his collection. He was a part of the FaZe roster that dominated the Cold War season, putting up some of the best numbers in competitive COD history.</p>



<p>By numbers, aBeZy is the highest-earning COD pro player in the world, and he has so much left in the tank for the years ahead.</p>



<h3 id="h-dan-ghosty-rothe">Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$267,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>Ghosty is another member of the LA Thieves ‘Super Team’, a talented IGL with undeniable skills and a charming persona. He’s a likeable player with intense abilities in-game, represented nicely by the attributes he’s secured in a relatively short time in the CDL.</p>



<p>Ghosty’s first shot in the CDL came with OpTic Texas, and from there, he joined the LA Thieves. Nadeshot used Ghosty to build up a team featuring HyDra, Scrappy, and Envoy, and the play has been like clockwork ever since.</p>



<p>While an ultimate victory has escaped Ghosty thus far, his first big win is inching ever closer. In 2024, he landed in second place at the Esports World Cup and has been within spitting distance of netting a chip at a couple of Major tournaments. His in-game skills are front and centre, and the execution to secure a trophy could come during the 2025 season. </p>



<h3 id="h-brandon-dashy-otell">Brandon ‘Dashy’ Otell</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$788,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>OpTic Texas</p>



<p>Dashy is one of the best beamers in the business, boasting ethereal thumbs and the ability to never miss a shot. For that alone, he earns a place on this list of the best Call of Duty players in 2025, but his accolades speak for themselves.</p>



<p>In 2024, Dashy won the Call of Duty League Championship with OpTic Texas, securing his first ring after several years of playing at the highest level. He has the best team possible around him now, and the chemistry is on another level. The future is looking bright for Dashy, and he’s an integral part of one of the biggest brands in esports.</p>



<p>OpTic Texas isn’t in the <strong>best place </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/">to start the season</a>, but there’s plenty of time to right the ship and start securing chips.</p>



<p>Do you think another competitor deserves a spot on this list of the best Call of Duty players in 2025? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

		<p>I’ve never quite been clear when you’re allowed to break out the ol’ “pinch, punch, first of the month”. The rules always seem to be quite inconsistent. Is it any 1st of the month, or is it only from October onwards? And do you have to stop by midday, like with April Fools?</p>
<p>Anyway, spring has officially sprung, meteorologically speaking, and even though it’s still distinctly chilly a lot of the time, I’m definitely feeling the seasons shift. But this past week has seen the last throes of winter game launches, and one of the biggest games of the year is upon us all.</p>

		<p>Stardock has announced that it will be releasing the first paid DLC for Sins of a Solar Empire 2 on March 27th, and that DLC is called Path to Power. This new content will add more than 10 new scenario maps for players to navigate, with new objectives to tackle from defending your territory to assimilating other races into your own empire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sins of a Solar Empire II | Steam Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sbOAP-wKfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The ‘Paths to Power’ DLC lays the foundation for new, more dynamic styles of gameplay in the Sins’ universe,”</em> said Brian Clair, Executive Producer at Stardock. <em>“Not only will players get new experiences from this DLC, but modders will gain access to a whole new set of options to bring their creations to life.”</em></p>
<p>Three of the scenarios are ‘All As One’, ‘Defend the Homeworld, and ‘Scorched Space.’ In the ‘All As One’ scenario players take control of the Vasari Alliance which is facing a catastrophic event with planets disintegrating as an unknown force moves through the darkness. The objective is to escape but to do that the Vasari Alliance will need to gather resources and forge new relationships with other factions to help them. In ‘Defend the Homeworld’, players play as Pranast United which is under attack. There is no victory condition, as victory is impossible. The only goal is to see how long you can survive the waves of attack. In the ‘Scorched Space’ scenario, a new star system has been found that contains the remnants of an unknown race. There are two options in this scenario. Restore this lost technology for your own use, or destroy it to keep it out of the hands of other factions.</p>

<p>The paid content is not all that will be coming to Sins of a Solar Empire 2. Update 1.4 will change the relationship between population and culture, with a larger population making your empire more influential in the grand scheme of the game. There will be new units added as well and some balance changes too. Paths of Power has been priced at $12.99, but is also part of the Content Pass and the Premium edition at no additional cost.</p>

Many fans are especially vocal against the idea of Space Marines 2 turning into a live-service game, especially after Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive introduced community events seemingly as the only way to get desirable items that are only available for a limited time. This time, the pushback has been so intense that Focus has apologized to fans and assured them that a live-service transformation isn't in the cards for Space Marines 2.</p><p>In this week's <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">community update</a>, Focus Entertainment shared the following statement: "We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items. We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live-service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone."</p><p>"However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far," added Focus. "We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining."</p><p>As a way to make it up to fans, the emblem-less Mk VIII Errant Helmet will now be available for free to all players who link their PROS account to Space Marine 2.

Game Club, a new segment for podcast Beyond! where each month we will be picking games to play as a group and talking about our experiences as we progress through them. The games will range from various classics to quintessential PlayStation games we consider must plays, and even revisiting some recent favorites to prepare for upcoming sequels (looking at you Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei)! However, for March we decided it would be a great time to revisit one of our favorite superhero games of all time: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/11/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been at least 10 years since many of us dove into 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and now feels like the perfect time to revisit the game that almost singlehandedly revitalized the superhero genre. Whether it was the excellent freeform combat of snapping back and forth between enemies with precision, to unleashing devastating kicks or takedowns, or the way it trained our detective skills to solve the numerous riddles by the Riddler – Arkham Asylum gave us the best depiction (for its time) of Batman and what it would be like to wear the cowl.  
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Beyond! team is eager to dive back into this amazing game, and over the month of March we will be talking about it weekly on each episode of the podcast as well as updating this column with our thoughts and hope that you will all do the same in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Nobody can lose their shit and start yelling quite like Gene Hackman. The actor, who was discovered dead in his home at the age of 95 this week (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under bizarre-sounding circumstances</a></span>), appeared in dozens of movies and won two Oscars. He did comedies, thrillers, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one kids movie</a></span>. He was also the best Lex Luthor we’ve ever had. </p><p>We took the occasion of his passing to look back at some of his best movies. There are of course the all-time classics like <em>French Connection</em> and <em>The Conversation</em> in which Hackman showed his range, subtlety, and fierceness.  But there’s also the more obscure thrillers like <em>No Way Out</em> in which he plays a Secretary of Defense caught up in a murder plot investigated by Kevin Costner. I watched it last night and my interest ebbed and flowed until the last 30 minutes cemented it as one of my favorite political thrillers from the era. </p><p>Sam Raimi’s <em>The Quick and the Dead</em>, a Western in which Hackman plays a diabolical sheriff opposite an all-star cast that includes Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio, also comes highly recommended. I’m putting it on this weekend. Here are seven of our other favorite Hackman movies. </p></div></div><div><p>Richard Donner’s 1978 <em>Superman </em>is not only the first modern-day superhero blockbuster; it’s one of the few enduringly great superhero movies, and that’s due in large part to its ebullience. It’s just a fun, joyful movie, radiating classic comic-book enthusiasm and energy from start to finish. And Gene Hackman’s portrayal of Superman’s archnemesis Lex Luthor is an essential part of that. Here’s the key to Hackman’s version of Luthor: he really seems to be enjoying himself. He’s constantly delighted by his own evil ingenuity, explaining his nefarious schemes to Superman with obvious glee while Christopher Reeve, as the Man of Steel, looks on disapprovingly with that wholesome, Boy Scout stare of his. If anything, Hackman’s Luthor is only more fascinating today than ever, as so many of us feel the ways in which we’re at the mercy of oligarchs who view the world as their own personal plaything, something to be manipulated and destroyed for their gain, no matter the cost to millions of others. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max</a></span></p></div><div><p>The 1970s are when Hackman established himself as not just a great actor but a movie star capable of carrying a film on his own, with acclaimed performances like his Oscar-winning turn in <em>The French Connection </em>and his legendary work as surveillance expert Henry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>The Conversation</em>. But my favorite Hackman film from this period is <em>Night Moves</em>, a morally slippery, sun-dappled Hollywood neo-noir from <em>Bonnie and Clyde </em>director Arthur Penn. Hackman is at his most enjoyably complex here as Harry Moseby, a football player turned private eye who’s hired by an aging actress to find her missing teenage daughter Delly, played by Melanie Griffith. As his pursuit of Delly takes him into the shadowy underbelly of the film industry and beyond, Moseby is also coming apart at the seams due to problems in his marriage. Be warned, you won’t find a traditional whodunit and a conventionally satisfying conclusion here; <em>Night Moves </em>has other things on its mind. It’s a distinctly 1970s American film—disillusioned, ambiguous, rich with character and fantastic dialogue—and it demonstrates why Hackman was an ideal actor for this fascinating era in American cinema. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCM</a></span></p></div><div><p><em>The Birdcage </em>is a ‘90s comedy starring Nathan Lane and Robin Williams as a gay couple in Miami who pretend to be straight to deceive a conservative senator in order to help their son who is trying to marry the politician’s daughter. It’s a very funny movie that feels ahead of its time in a lot of ways for how it depicts LGBTQ people.</p><p>And here’s how good Gene Hackman is at acting and being funny: He’s able to stand out and deliver a memorable performance in a movie starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. That’s impressive. So many other actors playing (literally) the straight man in a wacky comedy like <em>The Birdcage</em> would have disappeared and been overshadowed completely by the zany leads and their incredible onscreen chemistry. But not Hackman, who plays Republican senator Kevin Keely perfectly as a believably grumpy conservative who’s put into a very uncomfortable situation and comes out the other side somewhat changed. And Hackman’s comedic chops are on full display, especially in scenes featuring Lane. Track this one down and watch it ASAP.  — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Birdcage-Robin-Williams/dp/B004AZKI6W?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/gene-hackman-movies-stream-hoosiers-enemy-state-1851767152&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B004AZKI6W" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Prime Video</a></span></p></div><div><p>Few things in cinema are as pleasurable as seeing two towering actors butt heads in a film with a whip-smart script that gives their clash real stakes. The actors have never been better, and the stakes never higher, than they are in <em>Crimson Tide</em>, Tony Scott’s 1995 submarine-set pressure cooker in which a commanding officer (Hackman) and his executive officer (Denzel Washington) clash, with a potential nuclear crisis hanging in the balance. <em>Crimson Tide </em>is irresistibly compelling for so many reasons: the complexity of its lead performances, the circumstances that drive these men to collide, and the intelligence with which it engages with the nuclear threat. As Washington’s character puts it at one point, “In the nuclear world, the true enemy can’t be destroyed…in my humble opinion, in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.” Hackman is pitch-perfect as the cigar-chomping human embodiment of the opposition to this idea, an old-school navy officer with the capacity to kick off World War III. — Carolyn Petit </p><p>  <strong>Where to stream it:</strong> Rent or buy it</p></div><div><p>I’m not a big sports movie guy, but I’m a big fan of <em>Hoosiers, </em>and a big reason for that is<em> </em>Gene Hackman’s powerful performance as high school basketball coach Norman Dale. What I particularly like about Hackman in <em>Hoosiers </em>is that he nails the power and ferocity that tough coaches in high school tend to have, but he never seems like a jerk. In fact, he’s someone you root for just as much as the team of misfits he’s leading. Even if you don’t watch basketball or like sports, check out <em>Hoosiers </em>to see Hackman doing what he does best and proving that he was one of the greats. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p>Will Smith in his prime opposite a seasoned, paranoid Gene Hackman made <em>Enemy of the State</em> an instant classic. Hackman has always felt like an old actor, but he rarely got to play one. <em>Enemy of the State </em>let him school an electric Smith on the emerging surveillance state with grizzled wisdom and curmudgeonly charm. Plus the movie’s MacGuffin is a digital camera recording wedged into a Game Boy, because all technology is fun and whimsical until it accidentally implicates you in a conspiratorial coverup. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p><em>The Royal Tenenbaums </em>isn’t director Wes Andersen’s best movie but it’s certainly his most watchable, possibly because Hackman forced him to make it that way. It was his third-to-last movie appearance and one of his most charismatic, letting him seamlessly shift between humor and drama, dry, sardonic line deliveries and heartfelt admissions that land like an ocean liner. Hackman r<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eportedly hated making the movie</a></span>, which probably made it all the better. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By far the biggest, most disheartening industry news of the week was <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WB’s sudden closure of three studios</a>, including Monolith, creators of classics like <em>Blood</em>, <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>. While swinging the scythe and taking out Monolith’s much-anticipated <em>Wonder Woman</em> game, the company said it’s now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turning its focus</a> to “fewer but bigger franchises.” On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about why this strategy – which might make line go up in the short term – is ultimately a dead end.</p><p>We begin the episode by accidentally bursting the dam on another wellspring of Riley Lore – perhaps the wildest yet – before we all move on to a discussion of more sobering matters: the closure of Monolith and two other WB-owned studios. WB, of course, has proven especially eager to <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumpster promising projects</a> beyond the world of games in recent years, but what portion of this sickness is specific to the company and where does it overlap with the gaming industry’s own <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mismanagement epidemic</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about Jeff Bezos’ mask-off decision to <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transform The Washington Post into the propaganda arm</a> of his already-unimaginably-profitable business empire, the latest in a line of tech billionaires bending the knee to tired old king Donald Trump and cackling vizier Elon Musk. Speaking of workplaces that suck, we also discuss <em>Severance</em>, a show that <a href="https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely does not suck</a>. It has the trappings of a mystery box, but so far, it has successfully maintained a focus on characters above all else. Fantastic! Keep it up! Please do not become another <em>Lost </em>or <em>Westworld</em>! Finally, we suggest games that would be improved by the addition of a Nemesis System (basically all of them; <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuck WB</a> for patenting it).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can add a Nemesis System to Aftermath’s comments section.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think now we’re finally reaching a point where we’re seeing more misfires than regular fires. At some point, the industry’s gonna have to change course. But Warner’s going further in this direction: fewer, bigger franchises. Destined to fail. No doubt in my mind, that shit’s not gonna work out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I hate to reup the <em>Avowed </em>conversation, but I’m seeing my friends like Chris Person and Luke Plunkett wrap on <em>Avowed</em>, and [the solution] is not fewer, bigger projects; it’s more adequately scaled projects with clear parameters. That’s what we need. It’s not limiting the flagship game to once every five years or whatever. It’s having fewer flagship games and not resting all your economic and cultural expectations on one thing. That’s never gonna work. Why not be pleasantly surprised by a medium-sized game doing really well?</p><p>Microsoft has repeatedly said, despite what people on the internet will try to tell you, that they are happy with <em>Avowed</em>’s sales, and the developers seem to be very happy with how the game is being received by players and not weird people on YouTube. I can’t help but think that Microsoft – which is primarily a company that makes software and software products – does understand how to scale these things. Why wouldn’t you look to other industry leaders in this, instead of looking to entertainment industry models that don’t make sense with how video games are created?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> There’s that meme of “I want smaller games with worse graphics blah blah blah.” It’s not even that. I want mid-sized games that are scaled to a relatively sane degree – that are not trying to be everything for everyone because a) nothing can be everything for everyone, and b) the games that are functionally that already exist. You’re never going to supplant <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Valorant </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these big companies believe that if you just pump enough money into something, you can overcome all of life’s problems. And time and time again, they fail, and the money’s no longer imaginary; there are real, tangible repercussions in terms of how it affects the people who worked on those projects. They don’t have jobs anymore. The only people who were unaffected, as ever, were the fucking executives, and they get to keep making these stupid mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita and Riley:</strong> [Pregnant pause] Yep!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think that in the case of something like Monolith, it’s especially galling because their track record is crazy. They were such a good studio in this way that was somewhat underappreciated. I think their games, reputationally, grew after they came out and had their moment. Back when <em>F.E.A.R. </em>came out, people were like “Yeah, it’s kind of this interesting shooter. It’s got slow-mo. It draws on certain types of horror cinema.” Now, decades later, people are still like “Oh man, does the AI in this FPS compare to <em>F.E.A.R.</em>’s?” That’s become its calling card. It’s this legendary game in people’s minds in a way that it wasn’t when it came out.&nbsp;</p><p>Same with the Nemesis System. Everyone’s like “Where did that go? What happened to that? That was one of the coolest things to come out of a couple console generations ago. Why aren’t more people doing that?” Monolith came up with all this stuff that should have been imitated and wasn’t. Losing a studio that has that kind of ingenuity is one of those tragedies that can’t be fully measured. You can’t understand the knock-on effects because things that could’ve happened now just won’t. There’s only an absence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/islands-and-trains-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc"><h3>Islands And Trains Are Two Of My Favorite Things</h3></a><p>'Craft tiny railway dioramas in a stress-free island sandbox' oh hell yes</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> has been getting increasingly, delightfully weird over the last couple of years, leading up to last year's time-travelling, NPC-romancing blast back to 1999. And things are about to get even wilder when developer Digital Extremes invites players to start kicking boy band butt in its new Techrot Encore update, arriving on 19th March.
</p>
<p>
Techrot Encore sees Digital Extremes building on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">last year's 1999 update</a> by introducing a range of new gameplay systems. That begins with the introduction of the Technocyte Coda - a corruption of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88">Warframe's in-game 90s boy band On-lyne</a>, whose members (Harddrive, Zeke, Drillbit, Packet, and DJ RoM) will randomly appear in levels until players defeat them.
</p>
<p>
It's an adversary system - originally due to launch last year until it ballooned into something more expansive - that works similarly to Warframe's Kuva Lich and Sisters of Parvos. As such, players - who'll need to have completed The Hex quest first - can't have a Lich or Sister tied to them if they want to experience the Technocyte Coda. Oh and be warned that you'll gain a steadily growing pimple until you manage to defeat your bothersome boy band foe.

<p>
On top of that, Techrot Encore adds four new Protoframes to 1999's Höllvania Mall, which has been expanded to provide access to the grungy The Round Table pub. Here, players can meet Velimir (the Protoframe of Frost) and his ex-wife Minerva (Saryn), as well as brilliant young engineer Kaya Velasco, the Protoframe of Nova. And lastly, there's the David Bowie-inspired Flare - the only surviving member of a band called Temple, and the Protoframe for the game's musically inclined, talking-guitar-wielding 60th Warframe, Temple.
</p>
<p>
All these characters have a presence in the mall, meaning you can talk to them in the world, or delve deeper into their backstories through conversations using 1999's AOL-inspired KIN system. You won't, however, be able to romance any of the new NPCs. Not even the guitar.
</p>
<p>
Away from the story stuff, Kaya's your port of call for accessing Techrot Encore's tough new Temporal Archimedea missions. These can be played for various rewards, and feature a stackable sticker-inspired boost system players can explore to gain advantages while out in the field. That's alongside Flare's new Stage Defence missions, which see players venturing out to Solstice Square. Here, their job is to protect Temple from incoming foes across three waves (all Defence missions have been reduced to three waves in the new update) as he rocks out on stage in mourning for his bandmates.
</p>
<p>
Rewards for successfully completing a Stage Defence mission include Techrot Heartstrings. These can be given to Flare at The Round Table to get Temple's blueprints if you're not lucky enough to receive them as a mission reward. Temple, incidentally, is a heat-based Warframe with a distinct musical twist, given that he - and his sentient guitar Lizzy - gain an attack boost if players manage to cast his abilities on the beat.
</p>
<p>
Pyrotechnics, for instance, causes Temple to rock out on guitar and unleash pillars of fire, which can be doubled if deployed on the beat. Overdrive, meanwhile, is a crit debuff that spawns a circle of subwoofers to stun enemies, and can extend the duration of Ripper's Wail if on-beat. Speaking of which, this one's a buff ability that heals player and makes them invulnerable for a time, all while giving fire damage to allies. Landing on the beat makes healing twice as effective. And finally there's Exalted Solo, which turns Lizzy into a flame thrower (because why not!) that can be augmented with additional electricity attacks.
</p>
<p>
And there's plenty more! Techrot Encore also features a new Rainbow Road-inspired bike-racing arcade game known as Ollie's Crash Course, and brings new Ollie-themed cosmetics, including an Ollie floof. That's alongside a huge range of adjustments and quality of life improvents, including Warframe augments for Gyre, Qorvex, Koumei, and Wisp, plus a Pseudo Exalted Rework for Kora, Atlas, Gard, and Ash. Players can also expect a shortened Star Chart path - making it easier to access the Second Dream quest and the wild new content Warframe's added in the last few years. There's also easier Archwing crafting, plus changes to make The Duviri Paradox and the The Hex Quest more replayable. And most exciting of all, there'll finally be a way to replay Fortuna's iconic We All Lift Together cinematic.
</p>
<p>
All this will be available when Warframe's expansive (and free) Techrot Encore update launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 19th March.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-introduces-new-progression-loop-mastery-trees-abilities/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new post</a> released on the official Ubisoft website, those interested in Assassin's Creed Shadows would be able to read about what is coming in the game. This post specifically focuses on the progression loop of the game, as well as the mastery trees and abilities that are available for players to use. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on March 20, with pre-orders currently being available, which includes free access to the upcoming expansion called <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">Claws of Awaji</a>.</p>
<p>"Having two separate characters with unique archetypes in our feudal Japan world pushed us to rethink how we wanted to approach player progression," says Julien, Associate Game Director. "Our goal was to stay as close as possible to the philosophy of mastery and martial art."</p>
<p>Both Naoe and Yaskue will have multiple Mastery trees that they can invest in, with the trees being unique to both characters. The Mastery trees featured in the game are tied to the unique weapons that they can utilize, as well as the archetypes set for each character.</p>
<p>The weapon trees will allow you to improve your pre-existing skills, as well as learn new combos and increase weapon efficacy, which can help you progress through the game as combat gets harder. When it comes to the archetype trees in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are multiple abilities you can unlock that will be beneficial for Naoe or Yasuke. For example, Yasuke can put points into samurai training, where he can then learn how to switch weapons mid-combo.</p>
<p>To be able to earn Mastery points to utilize the Mastery trees, you will need to level up your character, which can be done by undertaking quests and activities throughout feudal Japan. There will also be unique enemies that you can take down throughout the world, which will also provide you with Mastery points.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes on to explain Knowledge utility, as well as the equipment and stats that you will be dealing with in the game. There will also be a multitude of gear sets that you can collect in Assassin's Creed Shadows for both Naoe and Yasuke. The gear and weapons can be looted from chests or can be found on defeated enemies. It's also stated that the loot is largely randomized to provide players with a sense of unique discovery throughout the game.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has released multiple of these blog posts now to provide information for those who may be on the fence about Assassin's Creed Shadows, as well as those who are eagerly awaiting the game. Thus far, Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">controversial games</a> in the franchise, with a lot of uproar across the community.</p>

Instead, it’s slowly built up a decently-sized library of first- and third-party retro games from across multiple console libraries. However, subscribers in Japan will be losing a retro game in March, even if they already downloaded it. </p><p>On February 27, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Japan quietly announced</a></span>  that Super Famicon game <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>will be removed from the Japan’s Nintendo Switch Online service on March 28.</p><p>Nintendo confirmed that even players who have already downloaded and installed the game on their Switch consoles will no longer be able to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S<em>uper Formation Soccer</em></a></span> after March 28. </p><p>At the moment it appears that this title is only being removed from Nintendo Switch Online in Japan. In America the game was released as <em>Super Soccer </em>for the SNES. So far Nintendo hasn’t announced plans to remove this version from  NSO’s classic catalog over here. That might be because while <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>was published by Spike Chunsoft in Japan, worldwide the game was published by Nintendo. So it would appear that whatever deal was in place to license the game is expiring soon in Japan, but that deal likely doesn’t apply in regions where<em> Super Soccer </em>was published by Nintendo itself.</p><p>While I doubt there was a giant audience for <em>Super Soccer </em>on Nintendo Switch, it’s still bad news to see a game removed from the classic catalog. </p><p>Although games are removed from Game Pass and PS Plus all the time, people can still buy those games digitally. With Nintendo, these games are locked behind the NSO subscription service and once removed, you can no longer play them on Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..">Just another good reason why Nintendo needs to bring back the Virtual Console for Switch 2</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
