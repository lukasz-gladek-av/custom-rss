It debuted at No.6 on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge">Circana's report</a> of the top selling games in the US for the full month, just after Metaphor: ReFantazio. But its placement on a single chart doesn't quite tell the full story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to analyst Mat Piscatella at Circana following the report to get a little more info on just how well Veilguard was doing, and he offered some context. Though it might look like Dragon Age is being soundly beaten by a number of other debut titles for the month of October, he notes that Dragon Age launched on October 31, and the chart tracks through November 2. So Dragon Age only had three days of sales reflected in the chart, while most other games on it had significantly more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Piscatella pointed out that EA does not provide Steam data for the best-selling titles charts, so while other games (including Metaphor) had Steam digital sales reflected, Dragon Age's numbers are only for PlayStation and Xbox. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Were Dragon Age: The Veilguard's PC volume included it would have placed higher on the best-selling titles chart — perhaps as high as 3rd overall," he says. "Unfortunately, however, digital sales are included in these specific charts only at the discretion of the publisher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more info, we asked Piscatella if there was any way to compare The Veilguard's launch sales to its Dragon Age predecessors, but Circana's weekly data only goes back to 2018, so no dice there. However, Piscatella did have some analysis to add about how things were going:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just looking at the first days of sales and initial engagement levels via Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, it's been a good - but not great - launch," he said. "Dragon Age: The Veilguard did not reach the launch week sales levels of either Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth or Dragon's Dogma II, and it will be a bit of an uphill battle to reach Inquisition's lifetime sales. But again, it's very early and a lot of the story is left to be told. November will give us a much better read."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we don't have sales numbers for Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Square Enix has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">said they did not meet their internal expectations</a>. Meanwhile, Capcom reported that Dragon's Dogma 2 was a success for them, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-has-done-so-well-capcom-is-paying-out-more-money-to-shareholders">having passed 2.5 million copies sold</a> as of this past April. We do have a bit more comparison context through sales numbers in the UK, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-video-game-sales-jumped-12-in-october-on-the-back-of-blockbuster-launches-european-monthly-charts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Dragon Age: The Veilguard debuted at No.7 on UK sales charts, but its first week sales were over 18% lower than those of Dragon's Dogma 2 and nearly 21% below those of Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave The Veilguard a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">9/10 in our review</a>, writing that it "refreshes and reinvigorates this storied series with enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of companions, and moving character writing."

Allegedly the former <em>Tonight Show</em> host was trying to find his way to a restaurant to order some food. However, not everything adds up in this story about an aging comedian falling down a dirt path. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/9bi1kPA_jWM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/9bi1kPA_jWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 19,<em> Inside Edition</em> </a></span>caught up with the very bruised and battered Jay Leno in Beverly Hills, California. He told the outlet that while staying at a Hampton Inn outside of Pittsburgh, he tried to take a shortcut to a restaurant down a steep hill instead of walking a “mile and a half down the road.” He lost his footing and rolled down the hill, hitting several rocks on a small dirt path on his way down. As a result of his fall he broke his wrist, lost a fingernail, gave himself a big shiner on his left eye and bruised much of his face. Three hours later, Leno—now wearing an eye patch—did his comedy show as planned, then went to a hospital after arriving back in Los Angeles, he says. </p><p>Jay Leno did in fact fall down a small but steep hill and got injured. That much is true. And if that’s good enough for you, then you can stop reading right now. But I have questions about everything else. </p><h2 id="h49471"><a id=""></a>Questions about Jay Leno’s Fall</h2><p>For starters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inside Edition</em> later reported</a></span> that after his fall, Leno arrived at a restaurant near the hotel called The Boulevard and ordered a chicken parm. The manager of the restaurant told<em> Inside Edition </em>that Leno arrived at the place without a reservation for lunch, ordered the dish with some garlic bread and then left. </p><p>However, The Boulevard is a restaurant located about 750 feet away from the hotel. That’s not <em>too </em>far away, but Leno told <em>Inside Edition</em> he didn’t have a car at the time. (Which is very ironic considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many cars this dude owns</a></span>.) </p><figure id="" data-id="5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-recommend-id="image://5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-format="png" data-width="848" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Leno’s path to the Boulevard from his hotel.

They suggest that Leno was craving some Buffalo wings and took the dirt path that had been cut into the hill by other people taking that same shortcut, didn’t realize how steep it was, and fell. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And this makes sense because in a different interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Leno says that someone at the hotel told him that there was a a good place to eat at “the bottom of this hill.” That sounds like someone pointing Leno to the sports bar at the bottom of the small hill, and not the restaurant up the road for some chicken parm.</p><figure id="" data-id="9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-recommend-id="image://9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-format="png" data-width="950" data-height="690" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path from the hotel to the sports bar located at the bottom of the hill.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adding credence to this theory is the fact after his tumble, Leno visited a local CVS and bought an eye patch, as documented by a worker via a selfie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The nearest CVS is just up the road from the sports bar</a></span>. </p><p>And yet, there’s the small problem that nobody at the sports bar remembers Leno entering and ordering anything that day. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local news site <em>Triblive </em>reports</a></span> that the manager on shift that day doesn’t remember Leno showing up, and nobody he asked could recall seeing the comedian eat some wings. </p><p>So that seems to indicate that the manager at The Boulevard was telling the truth and that Leno walked down to the joint, had some chicken parm, and then left short after falling down the hill and hurting himself. But it’s also possible that someone is trying to spin a good story so a major news outlet will highlight the location for some free publicity.</p><h2 id="h49472"><a id=""></a>What (Probably) Happened, Maybe... </h2><p>I’ve tried to piece together the stories and comments from Leno and everyone else, and I think this is what happened. </p><p>Leno was told he could get some food at a place down the hill from the hotel. He walks out, tries to take a shortcut, and falls. Injured, he likely calls someone (or someone is with him and sees it happen) and they grab a car. </p><p>At this point, someone points out that the restaurant is actually down the road and not in the parking lot near the hotel. So they head over to The Boulevard, Leno orders his chicken parm, eats it, and they drive back up that same road to the CVS at the intersection. He gets what he needs, takes a selfie, and then they continue back on East Pittsburgh street and arrive at the theater so he can do his show. </p><p>Or, Leno got mixed up as to when or where he fell and not everyone remembers what happened clearly and he did eat some wings at that sports bar but nobody noticed because, I mean, how big a star is Jay Leno in 2024? And maybe later Leno had chicken parm at that other place for dinner and the manager is confused about the timing. </p><p>Now I’m going to put away my maps and red string and stop thinking about this. Enjoy your Friday and the rest of the weekend. And be careful walking down hills. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone with kids who play with Lego <em>definitely</em> does. As a parent you don’t think that you’ll step on all the crap your fledgling spawn will leave all over the place, but what you don’t know prior to having kids is how braindead you’ll be most of the time just from having kids. But there are hundreds, possibly even thousands of unique Lego bricks. Which piece can cause the most damage?</p><p>That’s the question YouTuber Nate Scovill (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hackaday</em></a></span>) recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set out to answer</a></span> using a mix of the scientific method and <em>Mythbusters</em>-inspired excess. Scovill crowdsourced info from Lego enthusiasts on Reddit and Discord to narrow down the most potentially painful pieces he should research and then used increasingly elaborate instruments to test them.</p><p>First, Scovill used a series of carboard squares pressed onto the Lego pieces in question to record their “gradient of damage” and used a constructed, weighted arm slapping down on the cardboard to simulate the weight of a foot press. Pointed flames, wizard hats, and retro plastic trees all did some of the worst damage.</p><div><p>Not content to judge using the cardboard alone, Scovill also decided to make an entire foot out of ballistic gel. This would record the damage in more detail, and also allow pieces to become lodged deep inside the material if the simulated accident went that poorly. So what Lego piece actually ended up being the most danagerous?</p><p>One you’ve probably never heard of. It’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/253341120598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/253341120598" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">red wheel</a></span> with a metal pin in it that Lego stopped producing long ago. Back before the company’s engineers and manufacturing processes were as high-tech and refined as they are today, there were some Lego pieces that actually relied on metal to complete the connection. These red wheels, if stepped on hard at just the right angle,  bring more than a little <em>Home Alone</em>-style pain. Scovill remarks that you’d probably want to make sure your tetanus shots were up-to-date if you got nailed by one of them. </p></div><p>Fortunately for most of us, the pain of stepping on Lego can be exorcised with a few colorful expletives. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you've been wanting to look into playing Star Citizen,<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/"> the game</a> will be free to play from November 22 through December 5. This is for the premier aerospace event called the annual Intergalactic Aerospace Expo. This event is a celebration of space flight, the vehicles that have been created for doing so, and the important roles they play in the United Empire of Earth. IAE 2954 will be introducing the new <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/iae2954#/schedule/IAE-Academy-2954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAE Academy system</a>, which provides a crash course in spaceflight, with rewards being given to those who complete the tasks set out for them.</p>
<p>To celebrate the upcoming event, a trailer has been uploaded to the official Star Citizen YouTube channel so you can see what to expect from the ambitious event.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Citizen: What is IAE?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoCqee6MpIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once players have completed the new player experience using the Drake Cutter loaner ship, they can then rent any of the available ships so that they can take on the series of missions, which vary from bounty hunting to mining and cargo hauling. By completing these missions, you'll be given in-game UEC, IAE clothing, weapons, and armor to celebrate your success.</p>
<p>Those who attend the show floor will see new ships every day, as the featured manufacturers rotate each day. During the showcase, the manufacturers offer free rentals of their vehicles. Four new ships have been released and are flyable in-game immediately.</p>
<p>During this event, the RSI Polaris will be making its final debut. The RSI Polaris is finally entering full production and will be a flyable ship during this event. Up to 12 crew can fit on the ship, along with a contained mess hall and medbay. There is also a hangar space for a small ship, with a variety of both manned and unmanned weaponry. When it comes to vessels for long voyages, the RSI Polaris is shaping up to be a great one that is full of utility for extended quests and missions.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about the IAE 2954 event, it will be hosted in New Babbage on microTech where new pilots can sign up and play the game for free from November 22 through December 5. This<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/playstarcitizen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> event comes with a full event schedule</a>, which has been posted on the official website, detailing everything you can expect from the event as well as from the manufacturers that will be displaying their ships on the show floor.</p>

                <p>According to a new report, Microsoft has created a "new committee" in its Activision division that will make key decisions about the future of the Call of Duty brand. According to TheGhostOfHope, who has accurately reported on unannounced Call of Duty developments in the past, Microsoft's new committee will listen to suggestions from Call of Duty studios like Treyarch and Infinity Ward, but ultimately the committee will decide "features" and "systems" to come in future games.</p><p>Hope went on to say whether or not a feature like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-dev-hopes-omnimovement-system-becomes-a-call-of-duty-standard/1100-6524179/" data-ref-id="1100-6524179">Omnimovement</a> continues beyond Black Ops 6 will be decided by committee, not by any one studio. The insider went on to say a Call of Duty developers are being told "not to innovate" in "UI, Prestige, and certain gameplay features." Instead, studios are being asked to come up with new directions for things like "maps, modes, and storytelling."</p><p>"That is where they want the creativity to come from," Hope said.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1859722426860401126?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I am being told about the future of Call of Duty:<br>Microsoft has set up a new committee under Activision for Call of Duty that will control "features" &amp; "systems" at the franchise level and let the studios make suggestions.

As for Omnimovement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-dev-hopes-omnimovement-system-becomes-a-call-of-duty-standard/1100-6524179/" data-ref-id="1100-6524179">one of the developers at Treyarch said they hope it becomes a franchise standard going forward.</a></p><p>The reaction to Hope's reporting has been mixed. Some are saying they can understand this way of planning--after all, Microsoft spent $75.4 billion to buy Activision Blizzard and understandably wants a seat at the table. Others are pointing out the pitfalls of designing products "by committee."</p><p>Specifically, some are theorizing that the now-popular Zombies mode could have been cut if the decision came down to a committee. We can never know, of course, but it's true that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-zombies-an-oral-history-of-the-unlike/1100-6442252/" data-ref-id="1100-6442252">Zombies was a last-minute addition to Call of Duty: World at War and almost never happened.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details about this.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-helped-playstation/1100-6527989/" data-ref-id="1100-6527989">breaking records</a>. The Call of Duty series is historically an annualized franchise, and Microsoft has not signaled any change to that plan. As such, fans can expect a new Call of Duty in 2025; reportedly,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's going to be a Black Ops 2 sequel.</a></p><p>For now, though, Activision is focusing on Black Ops 6's seasonal content, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/" data-ref-id="2900-5940">just kicked off with the debut of Season 1 on November 14.</a> The next big release is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-release-date-revealed-for-citadelle-des-morts-map/1100-6527995/" data-ref-id="1100-6527995">Citadelle Des Morts Zombies map in early December.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-twitter-bluesky-growth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the first time in what feels like eons, we’re in the midst of an actual social media upheaval. Twitter is deflating like a balloon animal riddled with holes by the very clown who claims to have molded it, and Bluesky is swooping in to scoop up disaffected users. Recently Bluesky <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/11/20/what-is-bluesky-user-count/76451731007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit 20 million users</a>, and it’s growing at a rate of nearly one million per day. But just as Twitter was once a marginally-enjoyable experience – like Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and YouTube before/after it – Bluesky’s honeymoon period can’t last forever. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we discuss what comes next.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Ryan Broderick of the fantastic <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garbage Day newsletter</a> to discuss all the latest trends in the world of Online. We begin by talking about Bluesky and the potentially fatal blow Twitter has sustained at its hands. Or, more accurately, at Elon Musk’s hands, but Bluesky has far and away been the main beneficiary of Trump’s wannabe baby boy’s bumblings. How long will the good times last, though? Is Bluesky destined to eventually become a massive crock of shit, just like every other social media platform?&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we dig into the myth of The Liberal Joe Rogan and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how actual left-leaning and leftist political influencers are adapting</a> in the wake of an election that decidedly did not go their way. Lastly, we speculate about which specific <em>Fortnite </em>skins a fraudster recently purchased with Nathan’s credit card (hopefully <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as many Gokus</a> as they could get their hands on).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday build a new, better internet from the ashes of the old (or at least buy Threads and immediately shut it down).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I’ve seen a couple larger conversations on and around Bluesky about what it stands to become, and one of them centers around its culture. People are wondering if it will remain intact as the platform scales up, and that one is a little weird to me because – and we’ve talked about this some – the culture you see on a platform like Bluesky is a product of who you’re following. There are many cultures on there, as opposed to a singular monoculture. But I think that maybe the bigger question people are trying to ask when they say that is “As this thing grows into potentially a Twitter replacement culturally if not in terms of size, will it – just by nature of scale and platforms on the modern internet – become a cesspit?” Will it suck shit after a while?</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>I mean, historically, yes. I was just reading the other day about how the earliest Usenet communities almost immediately got a neo-Nazi problem. I think it was on a Behind The Bastards episode where they were talking about how there was a bank robbery to steal computers to set up the first neo-Nazi message boards to network and radicalize Usenet communities. So this is not new. Other than generative AI – which is just a form of spam, which is not new either – none of the problems of the modern internet are particularly new.</p><p>I do think there are moments when the architecture of the modern internet makes it better, and then there are times when it’s worse. The times when it’s better are when the different pockets of the internet are able to communicate but not forced to. And I don’t think that’s a scale issue, actually. I think of it as like biodiversity. In a world with more websites, you don’t feel like you have to use one. I think we can all kind of agree that as Twitter became the only website – and this was earlier for the media than everybody else – but during covid Twitter basically ran the world for, like, nine months. And that’s bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Like, I honestly don’t give a shit what 4chan or 8chan are up to until it becomes, like, a domestic terrorism problem. For the most part, go do whatever you want. I don’t give a shit. It’s when I’m forced to interact with those people and see their content all day, that’s when I get mad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Ryan, did you see when one of the people who works for Bluesky – one of the 20, because they have a very small team – was talking about how they’ve tried to engineer the platform and the business specifically around the idea that the company could wind up becoming the enemy of the future? For example, the company could someday succumb to many of the same problems that Twitter and others have. So they want to build their business and their platform now to be able to be immune to some of those problems – or to ensure that if things get bad, users can take all their data and go somewhere else. Did you see them talking about this?</p><p><strong>Ryan:</strong> I have. I think it’s admirable, but as someone who has had to migrate off a platform, Substack, that made the same promise, and it was a fucking nightmare, I just sort of assume always that they will be the baddie if they live long enough. And that’s fine. We’re all journalists. It just comes with the territory.&nbsp;</p><p>But I like that they’re using that in their story and in their propaganda. I like that open platforms are now cool enough that companies can kind of be facetious about it and be like “Yeah, we’re open.” And it’s like, first of all, Bluesky you’re not open because you’re not even actually on ActivityPub. You had to make your own thing that you own. So let’s pump the brakes here. But I like that they’re leaning into that idea.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>They can’t do it anymore because the site’s too big and everyone knows who they are, but I remember in the early days, [developer] Paul Frazee was a poster’s poster. He was out there letting the trans community on Bluesky mess with him on FaceApp and bully him into trying to become a catgirl. [The Bluesky team] was totally engaged and happy to have this community, and they have wisely I think taken a step back from being shitposters themselves in order to run this place. Because in any good community, there’s always a bit of antagonism toward the mods. I think that’s good for a community. You want to always be a little bit mad at the mods, because then the mods are forced to continually improve the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s only so much you can do to stop capitalism from doing its thing once you start a company or a business.</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>But also, like, we talked about the Tumblr porn ban, and just so we’re all clear, that was because of child pornography on the site. That’s why they did that. Everyone was like “It’s capitalism.” But no, it was a hub for predators.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I talked to a woman for <a href="https://kotaku.com/tumblr-porn-ban-leaves-artists-and-fans-seeking-new-pla-1831056412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a story on Kotaku</a> about the porn ban, and she said she was a victim of revenge porn that was disseminated onto Tumblr. And what she said was interesting: She didn’t think that banning all porn was the answer because she literally could not get an answer from Tumblr when she was trying to get the post of her revenge porn taken down. But she also understood that this move was because Tumblr was becoming a haven for child pornography and revenge porn.</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>And the reason I bring it up is because it was a deeply unpopular decision that people are still mad about to this day, and that is just the nature of one of these platforms. Your most cuddly-wuddly uwu platform will eventually have to do something because of child predators, neo-Nazis, or investors – all the same kind of guy, actually. That is gonna happen. That’s OK. That’s normal, to have those antagonistic relationships with your admin or your mods. That’s their job.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Another year, another Call of Duty, and that’s still not a bad thing. Activision has been generous enough to provide a sort of shared experience between games, permitting select DLC and weapons to carry over between titles, typically into the Warzone mode. As the first Black Ops title in four years, Activision and Treyarch have gone to show whether that wait has been worth it in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-BO6-Report.png"></a></figure>

<p>The setting this time takes a few steps in the timeline from the end of the Cold War leading up to the early 90’s and some of the Operations that defined American childhood. If not for the vignettes between campaign missions or the constant referencing of military conflicts in the background, the mood and setting of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> could easily fall anywhere between the Apollo moon missions and the turn of the millennium. One of the spy-centric missions has players infiltrate the inauguration of the 42nd U.S. President, Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 treats espionage with all of the finesse of a sledgehammer. With one notable example where breaking incognito will actively end the mission, going loud or doing an offensive job at trying to maintain stealth doesn’t really have any real negative impacts on the mission. In proper Call of Duty fashion, nearly any scene can turn into a proper gunfight if the player doesn’t want to slink around with intent. There are a few moments when the game attempts to reign in the gungho nature of the military shooter by forcing the player to investigate an enemy base and approach the mission goal in a number of ways.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6-Clinton.png"></a></figure>

<p>There are only a few moments where players won’t assume the role of Case and instead take control of one of the other antiheroes and Sev’s mission is one of the most notable for how simple it is: breaking into a military base controlled by one Pantheon, the big bad that makes up Black Ops 6’s boogeymen. Her mission objective is to disable three key military installations, but the player is given a number of ways to approach it (with the old failsafe of just bringing them all down with some explosive charges). The enemy AI is relatively dull, and only the most overt actions will alert them, giving the player some leeway into trying to sweet-talk a guard into letting them pass or knocking out a guard and stuffing them into a conveniently placed locker. Call of Duty Black Ops 6 ebbs and flows the narrative by inserting these spy missions in between the series’ signature combat corridors, and the pacing works all the better for it.</p>
<p>The nameless, faceless protagonist Case is probably one of the worst playable gunslingers in the Call of Duty universe and merely exists as a punching bag through so many missions in the eight-hour campaign. To permit Sev, Adler, and the other crew members to complete their tasks, they routinely sacrifice Case to get captured, choked, and nearly killed on more instances than I can count. The narrative opens with newcomer Marshall assuming they would be the protagonist of the campaign, only for the mute Case to go front and center (sure, there are dialogue trees to chat with your party members between missions, but you never get to hear Case utter a single word or combat bark). Sadly, the campaign ends on a rather abrupt note with the all-too-familiar tease for a sequel (or most likely a seasonal event in Warzone).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-Rook-Secrets.png"></a></figure>

<p>One story moment that I need to give Treyarch kudos to is in the few puzzles scattered around the campaign. Inside The Rook (the main hub and base of command between story missions) lie some KGB artifacts that require the player to go through some in-depth puzzle-solving to accomplish. By the time I jumped into the campaign at launch, players had already figured out the solutions to the rewards hidden in The Rook but jumping into the scavenger hunt blind is the best way to experience it. Grabbing a blacklight and venturing into the basement is only the start of this fantastic treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Differentiating Black Ops 6 from prior Call of Duty titles comes in the adjusted movement and traversal abilities in something Treyarch has dubbed Omnimovement. While jumping forward and diving is nothing new for the series, dolphin diving only really worked to evade forwards. What Omnimovement brings to the table is the same expanded movement, but in any direction, like playing out the good bits of a John Woo action scene. In proper multiplayer, expect to deal with many folks diving sideways through doors or sliding right into your shins when you least expect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6-Sniping.png"></a></figure>

<p>In proper Treyarch fashion, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 has three signature pillars: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While MWZ was an enjoyable way to introduce zombies and persistent missions into the open-world Warzone, players have been calling for round-based zombies for years now. Treyarch have outdone themselves here with two zombies campaigns that continue the ongoing narrative of Richtofen and Dark Aether experiments. Whether you’re in the mood for bowling and comic book collecting in Liberty Falls Americana or breaking out of a Pacific military camp, both experiences provide different takes on the zombies formula. By the time you’re reading this review, Treyarch will have already released the Guided Modes, giving players an easier time figuring out how to accomplish the easter eggs in each map while restricting the round cap, preventing zombies from overpowering players who don't farm up enough currency to hit up the local Pack-a-Paunch machines.</p>

</figure>


<p>Multiplayer really brings no surprises to the table, as players already know what Call of Duty’s multiplayer is all about. Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Headquarters, Hardpoint, Search and Destroy and many more make up the bulk of Black Ops 6’s core multiplayer offerings. New to the rotation is Kill Order, another 6v6 team deathmatch mode that sticks one player on each team as the MVP as each side rushes to reach 125 points. Killing the MVP awards two points and forces another player to spawn in and take the mantle while achieving kills as the MVP awards five points. At its core, the mode is Team Deathmatch, but the added point bonuses incentivize players to take a slightly different approach to the frontlines.</p>
<p>It took Treyarch and Activision a few weeks to roll out the DLC campaign for Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and the offerings here are all too familiar for the other titles ever since Activision launched the Call of Duty HQ. Premium character skins, emotes, weapon packs, and the like are around as always with purchases made carrying over into the cross-title Warzone. The typical Battle Pass also returns with players progressing through set pages in order (unless they purchase a skip to let them jump ahead to a different page). It’s simpler than the map layout in Modern Warfare III, but all roads lead to the same outcome of a plethora of sprays and stickers most players won’t use and only a handful of worthwhile weapons and character skins.</p>
<p><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</span></p>

<p>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</p>

<div>
		<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Pros</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Spy thriller campaign takes a different approach to the standard CoD campaign and pulls off some ambitious set pieces
</li><li>High contrast is great for accessibility as well as making Zombies mode easier to pick out targets (feature is blocked for Multiplayer)
</li><li>Combat Specialties give temporary wallhacks when respawning among others
</li><li>Pick 10 is gone, replaced with five attachments per weapon (unless using a perk)

</li><li>Bullet penetration on Nuketown and similar small-sized maps is mental</li>		</ul>

                <p>Hunting for a video game deal this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>? You don't have to wait until Black Friday itself, as Amazon has launched its deals early, and this includes nice discounts on a lot of video games. Sega's RPG Unicorn Overlord is discounted for the shopping bonanza, with the game selling for just $30. That's half off its normal $60 price point.</p><p>Prime members get free shipping, meaning if you order today, you could start playing over the weekend. The deal is good for the Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X versions of the game.</p><p>Unicorn Overlord, which was developed by Vanillaware, originally launched this past March and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/unicorn-overlord-review-a-rare-beast/1900-6418196/" data-ref-id="1900-6418196">scored an 8/10 from GameSpot.</a> We said the game "impresses with gorgeous visuals and engrossing strategy action." The story follows an exiled prince who raises allies to liberate the world from evil forces.</p><p>If Unicorn Overlord doesn't sound like your jam, Amazon has loads of other RPGs on sale for Black Friday, including Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5956"> nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards.</a> You can check out a rundown of some of the best RPG deals this Black Friday below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Square Enix JRPG Deals at Amazon</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VZXQYW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince (Switch)</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF66G8F9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Octopath Traveler 2 (PS5 / Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8WTP6W8?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Ocean: The Second Story R (PS5)</a> -- $20 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8WC4ZX7?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Ocean: The Second Story R (Switch)</a> -- $30 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ73WDH8?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Visions of Mana (PS5 / Xbox)</a> -- $45 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><h2>Atlus JRPG Deals at Amazon</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2FY9H73?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metaphor: ReFantazio (PS5 / Xbox)</a> -- $50 ($<del>70</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGFCC193?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Persona 3 Reload (PS5 / PS4)</a> -- $25 ($<del>70</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFDZDTJ8?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Persona 5 Royal (PS5)</a> -- $20 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Persona-5-Royal-Standard-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0BF9L5CK8?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Persona 5 Royal (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWN1727M?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance (PS5 / Switch)</a> -- $25 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWMT915Q?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Steelbook Edition (Xbox)</a> -- $25 ($<del>60</del>)</li></ul>

                <p>Godzilla could emerge in a brand-new location soon: Fortnite. A recent report states the King of the Monsters will be part of a new collaboration soon for the mega-popular game, along with the MonsterVerse as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">Well-known Fortnite leaker Shiina stated <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859974115387711651" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> that they've confirmed "Godzilla is coming to Fortnite," corroborating an initial <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1859974022420951360" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post by SamLeaks</a> that the MonsterVerse collaboration will be seen in Rocket League, too. It's unknown exactly what the possible crossover could entail. Godzilla could be a skin--along with King Kong, for example--but maybe the kaiju actually stomps across the map as a random encounter each match.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, Godzilla would most likely be a part of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-start-date-battle-pass-skins-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-5955/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5955">Fortnite Chapter 6</a>, which is planned to start December 1.

There are other shoes, too, which are all part of Fortnite Kicks.

The Atlus RPG is currently available on Amazon for only $25, which is an amazing discount off its normal $70 price point.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload originally launched in February 2024, so it's been out a while, but if you've been looking to score a deal, this is the best we've seen so far. The deal only applies to the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload is a remake of 2006's Persona 3.
