            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EasyGameStation has announced&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>, a remastered version of the cult classic 2007 item shop management sim that's coming next year.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about the project. In <a href="https://x.com/Recettear_EGS/status/1873564667366506965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), EasyGameStation simply says "we will open an item shop again in 2025", ending the post with the hashtag #RecettearHD.</p>

<p>Given the project's name, we're assuming it's not a ground-up remake of the game, but rather a remastered version for modern systems. Presumably, that also means we'll be seeing it on consoles, although it's difficult to say at this early stage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=RTTQRLD5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=5v_BVVSw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots released so far for the game include a shot of Recette standing in her item shop, as well as an adventurer exploring a dungeon and battling slimes.</p>

<p>In the first shot, we can see controller glyphs that somewhat resemble those of the Nintendo Switch, although all we've got to go on right now are an "A" and a "Y", which could also easily refer to Xbox controller glyphs.</p>

<p>We also don't yet know whether this version of the game will be localized outside of Japan, although one social media post seems to suggest that this will indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Andrew Dice, the founder of&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>localization studio Carpe Fulgur, noted&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/SpaceDrakeCF/status/1873584405652062392" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on X</a>, promising more info "in the year to come". If Carpe Fulgur is involved, then it's very likely we will be seeing&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>in the West.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=iq_StUKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=wPFfYfby 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll be coming to the West, and probably to consoles as well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, it's an item shop management sim-slash-dungeon crawler along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">is itself getting a sequel next year</a>), although it's much more light-hearted and satirical than Digital Sun's game.</p>

<p><em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>revolves around Recette Lemongrass, a girl who must pay back a loan on behalf of her father by running an item shop. She must haggle with customers, send adventurers out on epic quests to retrieve loot, and generally deal with the vagaries of JRPG capitalism.</p>

<p><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>lands sometime next year, although we don't know when or where yet. The original version is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's currently up for grabs at a tidy discount as well.</p>

The first trailer is full of nostalgia for the ‘60s comic books that launched the superhero, but with some stutter-y cel-shaded visuals that aren’t rubbing everyone the right way. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,196053,195859" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Streaming on Disney+ starting January 29, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> tracks Peter Parker experimenting with his powers, costumes, and burgeoning social media popularity while juggling friendships and homework. The first trailer also teases the show’s different timeline in which Osborne, who is normally the Green Goblin, is the technological visionary standing by Spider-Man’s side instead of Stark’s Iron Man. It ends with a first look at the web-slinger’s white and black Fantastic Four suit as well. </p><p>Parker is voiced by Hudson Thomas, Osborne by Colman Domingo, and Aunt May by Kari Wahlgreen, with appearances by Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock, Hugh Dancy’s Doctor Octopus, and other members of the <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting cast. Originally pitched as an origin story for Tom Holland’s version of the character in the MCU, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> is now its own thing, free from the shackles of the live-action productions’ deep and convoluted lore. </p><p>The trailer nails the fusion of modern sensibilities with retro-looking styles, though its lithograph-inspired animation isn’t impressing everyone. Some fans think it looks too choppy and flat. Others are wondering if it’s a budget issue or if this was the intended effect. It certainly doesn’t look smooth, but the comic-book aesthetic comes with its own virtues.</p><p> There are already plenty of <em>Spider-Man</em> cartoons in more traditional styles, so I’m excited to see something that’s taking a fresh visual approach to the well-worn source material.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stardew-valley-sales-have-now-passed-the-40m-mark.1071276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Smash hit indie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is somehow continuing its meteoric ascent despite the fact that it's almost nine years old, at least if its latest sales figures are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on the official <i>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</i>site's <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press portal</a>, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says that the game has managed to shift a staggering 41 million copies "as of December 2024".</p>

<p>According to Barone, more than 26 million of those copies have been sold on PC alone, while 7.9 million copies have been sold on the Nintendo Switch. The game's success being primarily PC-based makes a lot of sense given that that's the first platform on which it was released.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-farm.jpg?itok=epDSYwLo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-farm.jpg?itok=-w6Y-sJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has officially passed the 40 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It didn't take&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>very long to begin its journey to success. Just a couple of months after the game's initial launch, it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-breaks-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-1-on-switch-eshop-over-35m-owners-on-steam" rel="nofollow">3.5 million players on Steam alone</a> in January 2018.</p>

<p>Even on mobile platforms, where free-to-play games reign supreme and upfront paid products often struggle,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-ios-version-crosses-1-million-in-sales-on-itunes" rel="nofollow">managed to rake in $1 million</a> in sales on iOS within just a few weeks of its launch on the app store.</p>

<p>It's clear that&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has struck a chord to an even greater degree than other cozy farming sims; it arguably spearheaded the current wave of such games, especially in the indie sphere, so its success makes a lot of sense through that lens.</p>

<p>The game, which is heavily inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) franchise, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harvest-moon-creator-on-his-new-game-and-how-stard/1100-6445583/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">attracted praise</a> from that franchise's creator Yasuhiro Wada, who said&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>"carries on the legacy of the original&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>very well".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=ZE5YXRQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=N9wkuq20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's no wonder Eric Barone is taking his time with his next game.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what Barone is working on next, he's currently developing a new cozy life sim-style game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape" rel="nofollow">by the name of&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game's development is progressing slowly, largely because Barone is still working on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, which he describes as a "big and popular game" to which he has "a lot of attachment".</p>

<p>He also says that&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>will "still take a while", but that following the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>1.6 release on all platforms, he "<a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would like to finish&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>next</a>".</p>

<p>Here's hoping that happens sooner rather than later. Until then,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stardew-valley/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/stardew-valley/C3D891Z6TNQM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/stardew-valley-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and mobile platforms.</p>

			<p>The adventure games genre is usually a bit neglected by studios compared to more mainstream genres like action, roleplaying, and shooter. However, this year saw several great releases from indie and triple-A developers alike. Without further ado, let's dive into our shortlist for the best adventure game of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Indika-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Indika</h2>
<p>One of the biggest surprises of the year in the genre is undoubtedly Indika, the game developed by studio Odd Meter and published by 11 bit studios. In this game, set in the early 1800s in an alternate version of Russia, players step into the role of a young nun slowly adjusting to the harsh life of a convent. That's just the tip of the iceberg of her troubles, though, as Indika also somehow speaks with the Devil himself, who leads her on a journey of self-discovery that goes beyond the convent both physically and metaphorically. The game also features unique puzzle elements and 2D pixel art mini-games, as if its peculiar rendition of Russia wasn't already enticing enough.</p>
<p>Following its debut on PC, Indika recently launched on consoles, too, receiving widespread acclaim from fans and critics. It can be purchased for a 25% discount right now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Riven_Key_Art_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Riven</h2>
<p>Old-school gamers probably need no introduction to Riven. For everyone else, this is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riven-unreal-engine-5-remake-to-launch-this-year-on-pc-with-vr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the cult classic second entry in the Myst series</a>. Following the release of the full remake of Myst, Cyan Worlds has prepared the same treatment for Riven, delivering a full 3D landscape remade in gorgeous Unreal Engine 5 and expanded with new puzzles and a deeper story. Virtual Reality users can immerse themselves even more fully into this mysterious island.</p>
<p>As a founding member among adventure games of the puzzle subgenre, it's great to see the Riven remake doing so well. Fans are now wondering whether Myst III: Exile will be next. Meanwhile, if you've yet to check it out, Riven can now be purchased at a 30% discount.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nobody-wants-to-die.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Nobody Wants to Die</h2>
<p>The other big surprise of 2024 came from Critical Hit Games, which released <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobody-wants-to-die-developers-release-10-minute-exclusive-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Wants to Die</a> (published by PLAION) in the middle of July. Not exactly the best period to launch games, but this interactive story (think Quantic Dream's style) still managed to find its own niche.</p>
<p>The protagonist is Detective James Karra, and the story is set in a future (2329) version of New York City massively influenced by noir and cyberpunk settings. There's a serial killer on the loose who has been targeting upper class citizens. To complicate matters, Nobody Wants to Die takes a cue from the likes of Altered Carbon - here, too, the wealthy can afford to transfer their consciousness into new bodies to attain a sort of immortality. Karra also has his own tech gizmos to help him in the investigation, such as a time-manipulation augmentation that lets him review what happened at the crime scenes.</p>
<p>Nobody Wants to Die is currently 30% off on Steam.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dustborn_keyart_layered_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Dustborn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dustborn-a-familiar-feeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Norwegian developer Red Thread Games has been a staple of our Best Adventure Games series over the years, thanks to releases like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dreamfall-chapters-two-fates-bound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamfall Chapters</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/draugen-full-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draugen</a>. Dustborn took longer to develop than the others, to be sure, but the result was quite worth the wait, according to reviewer Amy Eastland.</p>
<p><em>Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the relationships between the characters unfold. However, the prologue soured it early on for me, as it felt a bit too overexaggerated. The conversations and getting to explore new environments were some of the best parts of Dustborn, while I unfortunately found the combat system to be a little lacking in places. Still, the idea for this game is incredibly unique and one that I really enjoyed.</em></p>
<p>If you're into the concept of a road trip with friends across a dystopic USA where you play in a punk-rock band and also fight baddies with words, Dustborn is currently 60% off.</p>
<h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p>2024 saved the best for last, as they say. With Lara Croft and Nathan Drake missing from the gaming market, MachineGames brought back the man who inspired those characters - Indiana Jones - in style with their newly released Great Circle. The game admittedly features quite a bit of action, but it still fits more with the adventure genre, as it relies a lot more on puzzle solving, exploration, and non-lethal solutions to disagreements. Here's the final excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>The game is highly successful so far, having already <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatched</a> a Game of the Year award from the Gamescom community, and Disney is reportedly very much open to greenlighting new Indiana Jones adventures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-martyn-brown-dies-57<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown has passed away aged just 57. He worked with the publisher for two decades, helping to oversee the release of games like&nbsp;<em>Worms</em>,&nbsp;<em>Alien Breed</em>, and the PSP remake of&nbsp;<em>Lemmings</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/team17-co-founder-martyn-brown-dies-aged-57" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, Brown's son Jack confirmed his death following "a prolonged battle with a series of strokes". Jack says Brown passed "on his own terms listening to his favorite music and surrounded by loved ones".</p>

<p>GI.biz points to a number of emotional tributes from other folks in the gaming industry, including one from Riot Games' EMEA publishing director Hannes Seifert, who somberly declares that "the light of our generation of developers is slowly but steadily dimming".</p>

<p>The Games Legend award is reserved for industry figures who've had a major impact on the gaming world, with previous winners including the likes of Revolution Software's Charles Cecil and Noirin Carmody.</p>

<p>Indeed, Game Republic managing director Jamie Sefton was one of the industry figures paying tribute to Brown, calling him "such a friendly, funny person" and describing him as an "industry legend not just for Team17 but also for his incredible support and help" for other devs and gaming figures.</p>

<p>Brown co-founded Team17 in 1990 as a merger between two pre-existing companies: British studio 17-Bit Software and Swedish outfit Team 7. His co-founders include Debbie Bestwick, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-ceo-to-step-down-after-over-30-years" rel="nofollow">stepped down</a> as Team17 CEO earlier this year following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-employees-allege-harassment-terrible-pay-and-more" rel="nofollow">allegations of a poor work culture</a> by employees.</p>

<p>As GI.biz says, he's survived by his wife Heather, as well as his children Jack and Harry and his stepdaughter Darcy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24322806/ps5-best-games-2024-playstation-sony<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It’s been a bit of a rough year for PlayStation exclusives and the studios that make them. While <em>The Final Shape</em> was generally lauded as an excellent concluding chapter to <em>Destiny 2</em>’s current story arc, Bungie was faced with all kinds of setbacks including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">canceled projects and layoffs</a>. Elsewhere, Sony’s Firewalk Studios <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">launched <em>Concord</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">unlaunched it</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">then closed permanently</a> within the space of a few months after the hero shooter failed to gain traction in a glutted market.</p><p>That said, PlayStation still came through this year with a slate of excellent games that will hopefully demonstrate that there’s an appetite for more than just live-service shooters.&nbsp;</p><p><h3><em>Helldivers 2</em></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds"><em>XDefiant</em></a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on"><em>Foamstars</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em></a>, <em>Concord</em> — 2024 has been littered with the bones of live-service shooters that came, went, or are limping along with little fanfare and even fewer players. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a><em> </em>was something special. It could be the game’s humorous over-the-top take on political propaganda, the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios fully leaning into the bit, or the regular content updates including the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320131/helldrivers">Omens of Tyranny update</a> that launched in early December. But <em>Helldivers 2</em> managed to be the one live-service multiplayer shooter this year (that doesn’t have <em>Call of Duty</em> in the title) that has the juice to compete against the big forever games like <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><h3><em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em></h3></p><p>FromSoftware has managed to keep the <em>Elden Ring</em> party going with the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>. The DLC is massive, stuffed with ass-beating enemies and so much delicious lore, all taking place over a map that is much bigger than what director Hidetaka Miyazaki called “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">the size of Limgrave</a>.” Truly, <em>Erdtree</em> feels more like a straight-up sequel to <em>Elden Ring</em> than a mere expansion of it — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320097/elden-ring-sequel-nightreign-the-game-awards-trailer">which is probably what <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a><em> </em>is.</p><p><h3><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h3></p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> took 10 years and a bunch of strife at BioWare to launch.&nbsp;There was no guarantee that it would live up to the reputation the series has established — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc">but it did</a>. <em>Veilguard</em> is exemplary of the<em> Dragon Age</em> series’ strengths: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review">characters you come to care for and choices that devastate both them and you</a>. Layered on top of that is a seriously detailed skill tree with a loot system that feels strangely like a <em>Diablo</em> game. <em>Veilguard</em>’s combat empowers you to customize your class to a level of specificity I’ve never seen in a <em>Dragon Age</em> game before, making it an interesting iteration of the standard warrior, rogue, mage RPG system. There was a concern that <em>Veilguard</em> would be overshadowed by last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23818692/baldurs-gate-3-starting-guide-tips-how-to"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, and while <em>Veilguard</em> doesn’t seem to have that kind of runaway success, I’m pleased as hell that, in two years, I got two wonderful, life-absorbing RPGs.</p><p><h3><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a> continues Square Enix’s attempt at adapting one of the greatest RPGs of all time to suit modern consoles and gaming audiences. This second entry in the great <em>FFVII </em>trilogy project takes over as the gang escapes Midgar into the wider world, and damn what a wide world it was. Every aspect from the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has been expanded and fully fleshed out, either with more story or with a fancy new minigame. Speaking of minigames, <em>Rebirth</em> is less about the events of <em>FFVII</em> Disk 2 and more a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081238/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-queens-blood-triple-triad"><em>Queen’s Blood</em> delivery system</a>, proving that Square Enix is really just a collectible card game developer in disguise.</p><p><h3><em>Silent Hill 2</em></h3></p><p>Remaking a classic game is always a tricky thing. A developer needs to attempt to capture what made the original so beloved, while also updating it for new audiences. And that conflict is especially fraught when you’re dealing with a genre-defining game like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>. But Bloober Team did a surprisingly solid job with this remake, ensuring that the idiosyncratic survival horror experience looked and felt at home on modern platforms, while still retaining most of the scares and tone of the original. The remake is a little cleaner than the PS2 game it’s based on, but it’s also less frustrating to play. And most importantly, it still mostly nails those foggy vibes.</p><p><h3><em>Astro Bot</em></h3></p><p>There’s never been a game I’ve instantly clicked with more than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>. Going back to my first demo with the game at Summer Game Fest 2024, I knew this had something special. <em>Astro Bot</em> is a well-crafted platformer that has players traveling through the galaxy to find the scattered pieces of a PS5 spaceship and its stranded crewmates. Though it pays tribute to the games of PlayStation’s 30-year history and features really neat homages to their gameplay, <em>Astro Bot </em>is also a love letter to joy. Every aspect of its design — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243763/astro-bot-sound-design-dualsense-controller">from its music to its sound effects to its bright and cheerful graphics </a>— is a reminder that there is still so much love in the world that aches to be discovered. <em>Astro Bot </em>was my game of the year from the second I rolled credits, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/12/24320203/astro-bot-is-the-2024-game-of-the-year">its GOTY win at this year’s Game Awards</a> was richly deserved.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Among the best and most unexpected modding projects to launch this year was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, which brings some stunning visual improvements to one of the most popular role-playing games released this year, as highlighted by a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The end of 2024 montage shared by the project's developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a> does an excellent job highlighting the improvements the mod currently brings to the game in pretty much every location in the game. From higher texture quality to improved lighting and much more, the fan-made project looks every bit as good as any proper remaster should.</p>

<p>The development of the Bloodborne Remaster Project was made possible by the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, which allows users to play the game developed by FromSoftware on PC even without an official port. A new version of the emulator bringing a variety of improvements was released <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/12/25/shadps4-v0-5-0-christmas-2024-release/">last week</a>, and made two more PlayStation 4 exclusives playable on PC - Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and The Witch &amp; The Hundred Knight 2. You can check out how the emulator runs both games in the videos below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>

But in a moment of exasperation, I flipped through the settings menu to find an accessibility feature that let me skip some of the more punishing platforming areas, and let me tell you, it was so damn helpful. — Levi Winslow</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prince-persia-lost-crown-review-accessible-metroidvania-1851174187&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prince-persia-lost-crown-review-accessible-metroidvania-1851174187">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aedf89842136125cd03ed0551cdb5c14" data-recommend-id="image://aedf89842136125cd03ed0551cdb5c14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ichiban Kasuga poses shirtless in front of the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ichiban Kasuga poses shirtless in front of the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aedf89842136125cd03ed0551cdb5c14" data-recommend-id="image://aedf89842136125cd03ed0551cdb5c14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ichiban Kasuga poses shirtless in front of the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I’m soaking up the sun as I stroll along the beautiful beaches of Hawaii when suddenly a group of suspicious-looking characters take notice. As they approach, threatening me, I’m transported from the reality of Hawaii around me to some kind of alternate dimension where I’m expected to pull off some thrilling heroics. My enemies no longer look like your average tough guys on the street—their eyes glow red, they’re able to spew toxic fumes at me. But their new monstrous appearance is no match for my sweet selection of skills, my trusty baseball bat, and a crew of comrades who are ready to dive in with their own eccentric combat skills. But before they throw down, they’ll have to wait their turn, of course. — Claire Jackson</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87d817ed0f8852d36178b0e2c007fb6c" data-recommend-id="image://87d817ed0f8852d36178b0e2c007fb6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Makoto, Akihiko, Koromaru, and Aigis prepare to attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Makoto, Akihiko, Koromaru, and Aigis prepare to attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87d817ed0f8852d36178b0e2c007fb6c" data-recommend-id="image://87d817ed0f8852d36178b0e2c007fb6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Makoto, Akihiko, Koromaru, and Aigis prepare to attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Persona 3 </em>was always the best one. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-demo-akihiko-junpei-social-link-1851160706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-demo-akihiko-junpei-social-link-1851160706"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></span>, the from-the-ground-up remake of the 2006 supernatural, social sim-driven RPG, just eliminates any doubt.

But as I turn the next corner of clouding darkness, a bright red light paralyzes me as the forceful and commanding voice of my father tells me that not only am I doomed to fail in my struggles, but that I am actively causing the very harm I am seeking to alleviate. Be it through failure or a curse that he expects me to believe I carry with me that will spread to others, he calls me his daughter with a possessiveness that rattles me. It inspires fear and rage. Yet I continue to move forward, to find a way through, to find spaces where his corruption hasn’t spread. And I do this not only for myself, but for others to whom I have promised aid. But in my quest to kill godlike forces that are causing misery, I am ever aware of a creeping darkness that threatens to consume me and others. What must I do to heal this world? Is that  what I’m here to do? Can I do this? As I hear my father’s voice again, reminding me of his abuse, I realize I have no choice. I <em>must</em> survive and bring an end to the suffering of all those I encounter. — Claire Jackson</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-recommend-id="image://275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eerie glow eminates from behind a door." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An eerie glow eminates from behind a door." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-recommend-id="image://275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eerie glow eminates from behind a door." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As I peer out from a ventilation shaft to catch sight of the unspeakable horror in search of me, I prepare to toss a wrench I lifted from the ground in the desperate hope of distracting it.

The monster turns and roars out that it has seen me with the contorted voice of someone I once knew. I have no means of dealing with this horrific creature and so I race to the nearest door.

And it’s fast, too—the two-hour run-time flies by without any filler, and a perfectly paced build-up results in a third act that will have your heart pumping almost the entire time.  — Alyssa Mercante</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-romulus-movie-review-timeline-reddit-4dx-1851625237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-romulus-movie-review-timeline-reddit-4dx-1851625237">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f2075e0455c6722b9273b6b05b7a1783" data-recommend-id="image://f2075e0455c6722b9273b6b05b7a1783" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1034" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A face that looks like it belongs on a metallic statue--but with a very lifelike mouth--appears to shriek in an organic environment with roots visible in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A face that looks like it belongs on a metallic statue--but with a very lifelike mouth--appears to shriek in an organic environment with roots visible in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2075e0455c6722b9273b6b05b7a1783" data-recommend-id="image://f2075e0455c6722b9273b6b05b7a1783" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1034" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A face that looks like it belongs on a metallic statue--but with a very lifelike mouth--appears to shriek in an organic environment with roots visible in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a moment in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> that would be the perfect visual metaphor for the game’s hopeful, proud ascension as China’s big breakthrough into the Western AAA pantheon.

Literally or metaphorically, from <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em>/<em>SaGa</em> and <em>Star Ocean</em> to <em>Xenogears </em>and even some <em>Final Fantasies</em>, a foundational narrative in which our heroes push back against a cruel, manipulative creator is like a spinal cord holding up many a juggernaut of Japanese RPG canon. But another enduring Square Enix series, quietly running just as long as the others, takes the opposite approach, embracing the positive side of religion and mythology. These are games about unity, the healing powers of nature, and the virtuous pride brought from trusting in a benevolent higher power.

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-recommend-id="image://5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aigis looks sadly at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aigis looks sadly at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-recommend-id="image://5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aigis looks sadly at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As a “definitive” edition of the phenomenal 2006 RPG, 2024’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></span> was lacking in a few key features like the 2009 PSP port’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-female-protagonist-portable-kotone-1851272602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-female-protagonist-portable-kotone-1851272602">female protagonist route</a></span>.

However, with 2014’s <em>Inquisition</em>, it seemed more vital than ever that BioWare not do this, as the studio ended that game with a devastating cliffhanger that saw your hero, the Inquisitor, locked in a battle of ideals with Solas, the elven mage party member who, at the game’s conclusion, is revealed to be an elven god. Surely, I thought, switching to a new protagonist now and sidelining the hero through whom we’d become so engaged in this conflict would result in a failure to do right by this story I’d been waiting a decade to see conclude.

Instead, <em>Great Circle</em> mixes <em>Hitman</em>-like stealth, <em>Dishonored</em>-like first-person gameplay, and some escape room puzzle design to create a unique, open-ended experience that feels both fresh and yet distinctly like Indiana Jones. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9bcda5c666c54398129711fe5fccf59a" data-recommend-id="image://9bcda5c666c54398129711fe5fccf59a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash against a white background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash against a white background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9bcda5c666c54398129711fe5fccf59a" data-recommend-id="image://9bcda5c666c54398129711fe5fccf59a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash against a white background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>, NetEase’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920">shameless <em>Overwatch</em>-like</a></span> featuring the heroes and villains that have captivated comic book readers and moviegoers for decades, is already at a crossroads.

With each subsequent movie, the <em>Sonic </em>films have sought to shed the generic “family” movie image for one that was more honest to the anime-inspired twists and turns of the long-running platformer series. And this latest film succeeds. <em>Sonic 3 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of the most beloved stories in all of the series’ 30 years. While the film does tweak some things along the way, it doesn’t shy away from the otherworldly, supercharged melodrama that differentiated <em>Sonic </em>from its contemporaries in the early 2000s. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>still falls into the occasional trap of talking down to the all-ages audience with low-hanging jokes and some frankly groan-worthy segments, but more than ever, the third film earns the right to delve into the video game excess that made these characters so beloved in the first place. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first time I installed Bazzite on a Windows gaming handheld, I laughed. It looked like <em>such</em> a blatant clone of Valve’s Steam Deck interface. Its many bugs kept me at bay.</p><p>Now, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a> running <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a> has all but replaced the Steam Deck in my life. For the moment, it may be the best handheld your time and money can buy — because it brings 90 percent of the Deck’s ease of use to the Ally’s more powerful hardware, larger 80 watt-hour battery, and variable refresh rate screen. Depending on the game, it can even offer <em>better</em> performance and battery life than the very same handheld with Windows. I’ve been testing it for five months, and I’ve rarely looked back.</p><p>This combination won’t be for everyone, because the $800 Ally X costs far more than a Steam Deck, and Bazzite still has annoying quirks. But because Bazzite can so convincingly transform a Windows handheld into a true Steam Deck rival, I believe it singlehandedly proves that handheld manufacturers are making the wrong choice if they doggedly stick with Windows, and that others should <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">join Lenovo in hedging that bet</a> as soon as possible. Bazzite is one way — another may come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft">as soon as next month</a>, when we’re expecting Valve to open up its SteamOS to more partners.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">review</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">review</a> of handheld gaming PC, I’ve tried to explain: Windows isn’t a good portable gaming experience. It’s bloated, full of self-serving prompts to share your data with Microsoft, subscribe to Microsoft’s services, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23935029/microsoft-edge-forced-windows-10-google-chrome-fight">use Microsoft’s apps</a>. It’s not designed to let you navigate with gamepad controls or even do simple keyboarding on a 7-inch touchscreen display. It’s not good at making sure games launch full-screen, and worst of all, I’ve never been able to trust a Windows handheld to sleep and resume properly when I drop it into a bag.</p><p>The Steam Deck, with its Linux-based SteamOS, has no such problems. It’s <em>far</em> closer to the “it just works” experience of a Nintendo Switch or PS5. I know my game will almost always be ready to play as soon as I hit the power button, and there’s a gamepad-accessible keyboard ready to go whenever I like. But SteamOS hasn’t been broadly available for <em>other</em> company’s handhelds — which brings us to Bazzite.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">open-source Bazzite</a> is a way to bring SteamOS’s strengths to hardware that doesn’t yet have Valve’s blessing. It’s not <em>technically</em> SteamOS, as it’s based on Fedora Linux rather than Arch Linux, contains many different and/or updated components and a lot of custom tweaks. But it plays the same games the same exact way, and the parts you touch are sometimes even laughably the same. Bazzite includes an exact copy of the Steam Deck’s UI right down to Valve’s own tutorial on how to use the Steam Deck’s buttons — all of which should theoretically be OK with Valve, as it expressly allows anyone to distribute an unlimited number of copies of that software <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamos%2Fdownload%3Fver%3Dsteamdeck%23%3A~%3Atext%3DLimited%2520Redistribution%2520License">under a limited license</a>.</p><p>Despite what you may have heard, it’s not true that Windows handhelds offer more games than SteamOS. Not only does Valve’s Proton compatibility layer run many Windows games <em>better</em> than on an equivalent Windows handheld, many titles that are broken and abandoned on Windows have already been fixed by the Linux community. While the Linux-based SteamOS does have fewer popular multiplayer shooting games because publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">aren’t willing or able to offer the same anti-cheat solutions</a>, I’ve found it’s a small price to pay.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Handheld Daemon, accessible with a double-tap of the Quick Access Menu key just below the Start button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>To me, the surprising part is that Bazzite doesn’t feel like a hack. For me, it’s been so much more reliable than Windows that it makes Windows feel foreign on handhelds, even though I use Windows on my desktop every single day. And it’s fairly easy to set up, with its own installer that walks you through setup. You can even competently dual-boot Bazzite alongside Windows, holding down your handheld’s boot menu shortcut button(s) when you restart to swap between the two.</p><p>And when I did that with the Asus ROG Ally X, directly comparing Bazzite and Windows, I often found games ran<em> faster</em>, smoother, <em>and</em> used slightly less power with Bazzite’s Linux-based operating system.</p><p>It’s not night and day. While I saw up to 13 percent faster performance in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</em>, sometimes performance was identical in other games. In <em>Returnal</em>, the particularly demanding game where you crash-land on an alien planet full of destructible objects and swarming enemies, my framerate was initially worse, though a recent update put it on par; in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, my framerate was initially better but an update has now made it worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with games that are 13 percent faster, we’re generally just talking about a small handful of frames; I never saw enough speed increase that a game became playable on Bazzite that wasn’t playable on Windows through faster framerate alone.</p><div><p><em>All games tested at 720p low. </em></p></div><p>But they do often feel smoother, with fewer hitches! Like the Steam Deck, I notice that framerate doesn’t typically dip as low with Bazzite as it does with Windows. Many feel faster and look better on the Ally X than on the Steam Deck OLED, too, because of the faster chip and especially the variable refresh rate screen, which lets the Ally display every frame its processors can generate instead of capping at an arbitrary number that might feel choppy. (It’s a killer feature for GPU-limited handhelds, and it’s a big deal that Bazzite supports it today.)</p><p>Similarly, I didn’t see battery life savings in <em>every</em> game. I sometimes watch the Ally X drain its battery one, two, even three watts slower on Bazzite than on Windows when I set the chips to identical power levels, but that’s not always the case. In <em>Dirt Rally</em>, I saw an identical 3 hours, 8 minutes from both operating systems, and both <em>Armored Core 6</em> and <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> drained the Ally at the same speed, each offering three hours of play. But in <em>Dave the Diver</em>, I was able to make Bazzite last nearly an extra hour at 4 hours, 14 minutes, far closer to my 4 hour, 42-minute result with the Steam Deck OLED.</p><p>That’s because like SteamOS, Bazzite makes it easy to tweak how much power and performance you’re using on the fly. Not only does Bazzite have the same built-in Gamescope monitoring tool Valve uses on the Steam Deck, you can also double-tap the Ally X’s quick access button to pull up an integrated version of Handheld Daemon, a power user tool that lets you change your chip’s exact TDP to toggle turbo or battery savings (or RGB lighting, or rumble, or many more) in a snap.</p><p>Frankly, the interface is more responsive and reliable than Asus’ own Armory Crate UI overlay, though it can’t quite do everything that Asus does with its own hardware. Two key examples: the Ally X’s rear macro buttons don’t work unless you instruct Handheld Daemon to emulate a Sony DualSense Edge controller, which is easy but can mean mismatched button prompts in some games. And you can’t hold down the power button to quickly access the Linux desktop mode or a shutdown menu.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Steam can recognize the back buttons of </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review"><em>Sony’s fancy PS5 pad</em></a><em>, so here Bazzite is telling it that the ROG Ally’s buttons are coming from that one.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But using those chip wattage adjustments, I easily managed to improve battery life even further than Windows in some of the least demanding games I test, ones where the Steam Deck has generally run circles around the competition in the past. In both <em>Balatro</em> and <em>Slay the Spire</em>, I got the handheld’s total battery drain down to just 6.4 watts by setting the chip to 5 watts and dimming screen brightness to minimum, which theoretically gives you a maximum of 12.5 hours from the 80 watt-hour pack. That is class-leading battery life, folks — even better than the Steam Deck OLED.</p><p>And when you need more performance, the Ally X has the battery to take it places the Deck OLED can’t comfortably compete. When I set the Ally X to its 25W “Turbo” mode, I get over two hours of <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and nearly two hours of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, at a very playable 900p resolution with a “Balanced” level of render scaling. (If you can tolerate a lower-res picture, you can get nearly three hours of <em>BG3</em> at 17W TDP.)</p><p>In short, I don’t worry about the Ally X’s battery with Bazzite any more than I do with the Steam Deck OLED, particularly since Bazzite added support for the ROG Ally X’s extreme standby mode where I find I only lose four percent battery overnight.</p><p>But there are things I do miss about the Steam Deck OLED and its native SteamOS. While Bazzite does include Steam’s wonderful controller remapping and support the ROG Ally X’s gyroscope for precision aiming, it doesn’t magically give it a pair of twin touchpads to make generations of older mouse-and-trackball games work. You don’t get the Deck OLED’s slightly larger screen with more vibrant colors and brilliant HDR light. I personally still think the Deck has better ergonomics, too, though the Ally X is certainly my second favorite among today’s leading handhelds.</p><p>The gamepad controls also sometimes take a little bit longer to come back to life after resuming from sleep, even without extreme standby turned on. Bluetooth microphone support seems entirely borked in Bazzite. Sometimes there’s a long delay when I’m trying to uninstall a game before the system responds. Whenever there’s a Bazzite update, I’ll uselessly see Valve’s last update message instead of Bazzite’s and have no idea what I’m about to get. Occasionally I see performance take a turn for the worse after an update, like how <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> is suddenly giving me lower framerate than with Windows. And it’s difficult to tell how long a system update will take to install.</p><p>Also, there’s a weird issue where if I almost fully drain the battery, down to 1 percent or 0 percent, the whole system will slow to such a painful crawl it can take 10 minutes just to save your game and shut the Ally X down. And I need to shut it down, because even charging to 100 percent doesn’t speed things up again. This is easy enough to prevent by simply plugging in the system at the five percent or three percent mark, like you’d need to do anyway with most other handhelds.</p><p>I’ve told Bazzite’s maintainers about these things, and they say they’re working on them — including a hibernation mode that should alleviate the 0-percent charging quirk in particular, and more intuitive updates. “We have also been improving support for other manufacturers, especially OneXPlayer, and for the next update GPD,” adds Antheas Kapenekakis, a Bazzite contributor who’s also the lead developer of Handheld Daemon.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think I would personally buy an Asus ROG Ally X over a Steam Deck, at least not now. At $800, it costs nearly twice the price of a base Steam Deck, and hundreds more than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the OLED version I personally recommend</a>. To be worth all that extra money, I’d want to know the ROG Ally X isn’t just the best handheld today, but also the best handheld tomorrow. I would personally wait to see a new crop of handhelds at CES in January, and hear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft">what Valve, Microsoft, AMD and Lenovo have to say at their January 7th event</a>.</p><p>But if I already owned an Asus ROG Ally X, or regular Ally, or the Lenovo Legion Go, I would absolutely install Bazzite on it right away, perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dual+boot+bazzite">using a dual-boot configuration</a> to make sure I can easily swap back. You might be surprised by how little you’ll miss Windows. You might be surprised by just how much better the portable experience can get.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Photos by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When it comes to video games, 2024 wasn’t just another year. It truly was a standout year for games over the last decade. Yes, we’ve heard that sentiment before, but this time it felt different. This year brought a wave of incredible experiences, with something for everyone. From the smallest indie gems to blockbuster AAA titles, the gaming landscape was full of great titles.</p>



<p>Games like Helldivers 2, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, and STALKER 2 dominated conversations at various points throughout the year. But one game managed to capture the hearts of the Insider Gaming community above all others. That game, and the Insider Gaming Community’s 2024 Game of the Year, is Astro Bot. </p>



<p>In a tightly-contested vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>, the race came down to two favorites: Astro Bot and Balatro. In the end, Astro Bot edged out the poker-themed roguelike, claiming 37% of the vote compared to Balatro’s 33%.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-makes-astro-bot-so-special">What Makes Astro Bot So Special?</h3>



<p>This isn’t just another <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">3D platformer</a>; it’s a love letter to PlayStation’s legacy. With stunning visuals steeped in nostalgia, Astro Bot takes you on a journey through PlayStation’s storied history. Its level designs are masterfully varied, ensuring that no two stages ever feel the same.</p>



<p>From a gameplay perspective, it’s pure fun and, arguably, the most enjoyable 3D platforming experience on PlayStation since the early days of Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. The game is packed with inventive mechanics, each one thoughtfully designed to keep things fresh. Whether you’re wielding Aloy’s bow or transforming into a sponge to soak up water and grow in size, every moment feels like a perfect fit for the worlds Team Asobi created. Importantly, nothing is overused, so the game always feels engaging and never overstays its welcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-return-to-gaming-s-roots">A Return to Gaming’s Roots</h3>



<p>But what truly sets Astro Bot apart is the way it makes you feel. It’s a throwback to the golden age of gaming—a traditional 3D platformer without the clutter of microtransactions or overwhelming bloat. It’s just long enough to satisfy, but never so drawn out that it becomes a slog. Playing Astro Bot feels like revisiting the essence of what made so many of us fall in love with video games in the first place. Even the game’s soundtrack evokes a feeling of yesteryear while still feeling fresh and modern.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Astro Bot as the Game of the Year, or is there another 2024 standout that stole your heart? Let us know down below, and join the conversation in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

This new version of the trailer, which was originally streamed on Chinese video streaming service BiliBili and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLzVdNhcdtwUvWkDA-9_ZrBpzAcc0bDl/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, has a higher bitrate than the YouTube version, which</span>&nbsp;makes it easier to appreciate some of the visual's finer details.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the release of the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, but the anticipation for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games continues to become bigger by the day. Its release is expected by analysts to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch to date</a>, and its<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/"> release window will have an impact on the entire video game industry</a>, as other publishers are aiming to launch their games as far away from it as possible and are holding back setting release dates for them until Rockstar Games finally confirms if the game is indeed launching in late 2025, or if it will be delayed to 2026, which is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">definite possibility</a>, considering the game's scope.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Half-Life 3 has moved to its next round of playtesting, it has been claimed.</p>



<p>That’s according to Gabe Follower, who has a history of leaking similar information on previous Valve titles, most notably Deadlock last year.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JgtJPzbI&amp;ab_channel=GabeFollower" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gabe Follower</a>, his sources have revealed that HLX (Half-Life 3) started playtests for Family and Friends of Valve developers in the past few months. </p>



<p>While the information doesn’t give us much information into what Half-Life 3 entails, it does tell us that the project is now at a fundamental stage of development and could see the game delayed further if it does not resonate well with the new playtests. </p>



<p>Previously, Valve delayed Half Life Alyx, its VR game, for one year to re-write the story. Deadlock, Valve’s upcoming team-based multiplayer shooter, also saw several delays due to feedback during these sessions. </p>



<p>The playtests do tell us that Half-Life 3 could be nearing its announcement soon, though, presumably sometime during 2025. If not, well, it’s entirely possible that the game could leak online due to the game now being accessed by more people.</p>



<p>As for when Half-Life 3 will be released, it remains to be seen, but Gabe Follower’s claims suggest that the game is progressing well.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Half-Life 3? Let us know down below and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-cease-exclusive-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Remake series could cease to be a PlayStation console exclusive in 2025, judging from some recent statements.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://br.ign.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/134307/news/nao-podemos-ser-exclusivos-de-um-unico-console-diretor-de-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-diz-que-numeros-de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN Brazil</a> during The Game Awards 2024, Remake series producer Yoshinori Kitase commented on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sales and console exclusivity. While sales of the second entry in the series are deemed satisfactory despite the game not meeting profit expectations following launch, Kitase-san commented that it has become clear that modern games can no longer be exclusive to a single platform and that they need to be offered to as many players as possible.</p>
<p>Yoshinori Kitase isn't the only member of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series development team whose comments suggest the series could be coming to other platforms in the future. Speaking with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241216014/index_5.html#sqe_ham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> as part of their end-of-the-year developer roundup, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi stated that the team will continue to take on the challenge of bringing the series to as many fans as possible in 2025. As the second entry in the series is coming to PC in less than a month, it's evident how Hamaguchi-san is likely talking about other platforms as well, such as the Xbox Series X and S and the Nintendo Switch 2, which should be able to handle both games with some compromises in terms of visuals and performance if the leaked specs are real.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it won't take too long for the Final Fantasy VII Remake series to be released on other platforms, as the first two entries in the series are excellent games that deserve to be experienced by any JRPG fan. You can learn more about the first entry by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">my review</a> and about Rebirth by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/complete-rt-shader-1-6-promises-3x-faster-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Graphics modder NiceGuy has just updated his<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-and-complete-rt-shaders-get-major-updates-with-sky-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Complete RT</a> ReShade shader to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/complete-rt-1-6-118832379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 1.6</a>, claiming many improvements, such as up to three times faster performance.&nbsp;As shown in the video, running the Global Illumination mode at native resolution (100% on the slider) takes just 4ms versus the 13.5 ms of the previous Complete RT 1.5. This translates into much higher frame rates (71 FPS versus 49 FPS). Of course, this may vary depending on the game and the scene.</p>
<p>There's more, as the internal upscaler has received several updates. CompleteRT is now capable of dynamically adjusting the Global Illumination resolution with floating-point scales from 33% to 100%, and it can even automatically match the rendering resolution when using all the industry-standard upscalers from NVIDIA (DLSS), AMD (FSR), Intel XeSS, and even Epic's own Unreal Engine TSR. Additionally, this reportedly helps with performance, reduces flickering, and improves overall quality.</p>
<p>Complete RT's implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nvrtx-branch-has-been-updated-with-experimental-restir-gi-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> was also enhanced. NiceGuy says both performance and quality have received an upgrade, and the accuracy is now close to the ground truth image. Lastly, the new shader has better specular reflections, too, thanks to a fix for the flickering that used to appear when using low roughness values. The precision of the reflections and their performance was also improved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Complete RT 1.6 | Teaser Update: 3x faster RAY TRACING! better Upscaling &amp; ReSTIR GI, new NiceHancer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9gEk1j_j6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NiceGuy also announced a brand new shader called eLITE RT. This is meant to be a much lighter screen space ray traced GI shader that could potentially run even on low-end or handheld hardware. The modder says he spent months of research and development on this project, essentially swapping priorities compared to Complete RT. While the latter focuses on quality while still targeting solid performance, eLITE RT focuses on performance while trying to achieve good quality.</p>
<p>Both shaders are only available to his Patreon subscribers. While Complete RT is unlocked on the second tier, which costs $6 monthly, the new eLITE RT is currently only available for subscribers of the third tier, priced at $11.50 monthly. That's because it is still in beta and requires more testing and feedback; it will eventually be moved to the same tier of Complete RT once it's ready.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Our Path of Exile 2 Class Tier List in Early Access]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access.1071168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 has six classes available, with another six coming as the game progresses. There will be 12 classes and 36 ascendancies in due time, making it a genuinely expansive game with countless hours of playtime available. But for now, you’re limited to a few starting classes. Here’s the thing, though. They rock! At least in our opinion. </p>



<p>So we decided to rank them all with a Path of Exile 2 class tier list for Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-s-best-classes-ranked-this-is-totally-our-opinion">Path of Exile 2’s Best Classes Ranked (This is Totally Our Opinion!)</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Yes, you will have your own tier list, and we’d love to hear which classes you place in S-Tier in the comments below. Do you disagree with us? Let us know! We love discussing our favorite games, especially when you bring them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-classes">S-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>The <strong>Mercenary </strong>is the big new class available in Path of Exile 2, and after playing through the entire campaign with one, I can attest to its strength. You can turn the crossbow into a close-quarters shotgun and lob grenades with reckless abandon. It’s a fun, powerful class capable of downing most bosses in the game.</p>



<p>Following that, we have the <strong>Witch </strong>with its powerful summons and the <strong>Monk </strong>with its creative abilities and fast, hard-hitting martial arts capable of making quick work of most enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mercenary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-classes">A-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>You can solo the entirety of Path of Exile 2 with the <strong>Ranger</strong>, so long as you have the proper equipment. A powerful bow will take you far. As for the <strong>Sorceress</strong>, the right build and an occasional helping hand in defeating some of the more challenging bosses in the game, which you can ask for in the global chat, push both classes into A-Tier.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ranger</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong></li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-b-tier-classes">B-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>From firsthand experience, the <strong>Warrior</strong> has the potential to be potent against mobs and ranged bosses, but it’s a slow class to start with. If you have the patience to stick with the brute force of a club-wielding monster, you’ll find a powerful class capable of tanking enemies, but one that excels with a group, like a Sorceress or Ranger.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>No matter when you dive into Path of Exile 2, chances are you want to know about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-become-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game going free-to-play</a>, right? Then, you can finally convince your friends to play!</p>

<p>The biggest Nintendo Switch games arriving in 2025 are sure to occupy your free time, and we’ve handpicked the best exclusives and some interesting third-party titles to look out for.</p>



<p>My Nintendo Switch hasn’t seen as much action in 2024—dare I say, it’s gathered a bit of dust. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Peach Showtime</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> haven’t scratched the itch, and there seems to be a bigger emphasis on remakes and remasters. Talk of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> continues to intensify, and it feels like a necessary step to bring more impressive exclusives and power-sapping third-party games.</p>



<p>2025 is ignoring this notion for now though, because it has some juicy Nintendo Switch games lined up. Forgotten sequels and big franchise sequels are also lined up, so let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025">Nintendo Switch Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Nintendo Directs and other presentations are almost certain to deliver shock announcements. Expect surprises and shadow drops throughout 2025, but for now, these games we know are pretty much locked in for 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Darn those Space Pirates. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A torrid development period stunted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>‘s progress. With the success of Metroid Prime Remastered in the distance now, the Nintendo community is clamoring for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Its reintroduction and long-awaited gameplay debut in 2024 reminded everyone why it’s so hyped. Samus is back with her trusty weapons, battling more Metroids and Space Pirates, all to another funky soundtrack. This could be Nintendo’s biggest ace up its sleeve, so here’s hoping it meets its announced 2025 release window.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Pokémon is the gift that keeps giving. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is the follow-up to 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and it seems to be an entirely new story. The island of Hokkaido is replaced by a more populated and livelier Lumiose City. A single trailer is all we have, and even though it’s quite vague—we’re interested. I love Arceus, and it’s mostly what I’m looking for in a modern Pokémon game. But its sometimes empty and barren world—and lack of Trainer battles—left a gaping hole. Here’s hoping Pokemon Legends: Z-A can deliver, and bring an improved performance compared to the technical mishaps of Scarlet and Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzle galore. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> makes many of our fun 2025 lists—because Donkey Kong is fun. So much so, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a simple remaster, adding new content, but keeping the authentic feel of the Wii original. You’re assured of platforming paradise with more than a hint of a challenge. We’re ready for its bongo beats and banana stylings and it’s one of the first major games to hit the Switch in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A whole world to see. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles has been a tremendously successful franchise for Nintendo. So much so spin-offs have sprouted from the main franchise, and the Wiiu was treated to Xenoblade Chronicles X in 2015. Like Donkey Kong: Country Returns—and countless other Wii and WiiU games, Nintendo has wanted to bring X to the Switch and is finally doing so with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. It’s an intense, JRPG encouraging you to explore its vast world, do important work for the BLADE organization, and fight waves of human enemies and titanic wild foes.</p>



<h3 id="h-civilization-7">Civilization 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not partial to Civ games—or strategy titles in general—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is a massive third-party entry on this list, with the series <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-civilization-series-has-sold-33-million-copies-since-it-debuted-in-1991#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20there%20have%20been%2066%20versions%20of,were%20copies%20of%20Civilization%205%20plus%20the%20expansions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">estimated to have sold well over 30 million copies</a>. The traditional fare of world-building through different periods of human history is all here. You’re posed with events and decisions guaranteed to affect your world’s version of reality and history, and it’s important your thinking cap is on when deciding the fate of the human race!</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Another round of horror awaits. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Little Nightmares saga is not for the faint-hearted. It inspires a new type of unsettling horror that low-budget jumpscare titles can only dream of. Little Nightmares features a new story, fresh, poor unwitting children, and the acclaimed addition of co-op. The second character can be computer-controlled, or you can invite a friend along to lap up the terror with you. It’s an IP going from strength to strength, and I’m expecting bad dreams to abound as a direct result of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m hopeful of a Nintendo Switch 2 announcement in 2025, and if it happens, what games do you want to see? A new 3D Mario game? The next Zelda? Let us know your gaming desires.</p>

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Recettear</em> is the story of an item shop, the girl who lives in it, and the fairy who turned her life upside down. Recette Lemongrass finds herself in charge of an item shop built into her house, in order to pay back a loan her father took and then skipped out on—and Tear, her newfound fairy “companion,” won’t take no for an answer! As Recette, you have to decide how you’ll get your stock—either through playing the markets in town or going out into the wild with an adventuring friend and thrashing beasts until they give up the goodies—how much to sell things for, what the shop should look like, and how to best go about getting the money Tear needs to pay off the loan. If you can’t come up with the money… well, hope you like living in a cardboard box.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge all aspects of an item shop—from stock to interior design!</li><li>Explore randomized dungeons—never quite the same twice!</li><li>Multiple <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,974 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs to choose from when dungeon-diving—no two play the same!</li><li>Plenty to do after beating the game—challenge yourself with <a title="Genres > Survival [365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Mode or play to your heart’s delight in Endless Mode!</li><li>Engaging story, localized by Carpe Fulgur—get to know the people of Pensee!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>Lucasfilm</span><span>|</span><span><p>Harrison Ford (L), cinematographer Douglas Slocombe (C) and director Steven Spielberg (R) on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>There are loads of great things about <em>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</em>, loads of very immersive<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and funny things</a>, but one&nbsp; thing you notice before anything else—and this is obvious even from watching trailers, let alone playing the game is that it's visually breath-taking. I don't want to take anything away from the amazing animators and modellers and concept artists who worked on it, the whole game looks incredible, but for this blog in particular I wanted to talk about how <em>Great Circle</em> (and particularly its many, many cutscenes) has been framed and lit.</p><p>There are moments playing and watching this game when I've simply taken my hands off the keyboard and mouse and gasped. So many moments when what I'm seeing on the screen looks cinematic not in the over-used video game sense of the word, but in actual motion picture sense of the word.</p><p>There are of course good reasons for this! <em>Great Circle</em> is, if nothing else, a painstaking labour of love from a team who knows exactly what makes <em>Indiana Jones</em> tick. It's an adaptation that hasn't just slapped a license on a generic experience, it's been designed from the ground up to make you feel like you're spending hours in Dr. Jones' shoes. The game's music is the music you remember from the films, Troy Baker's voice acting is perfect and even stuff like the animation is a work of reverence, nailing Harrison Ford's mannerisms down to the most minute detail, from his smirks to his finger-wagging.</p><p>That love can also be found in the game's eye for the cinematic. Watching <em>Great Circle</em>--the framing, the colours, the lighting, the emphasis--looks just like watching an actual <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie, or at least it looks like watching the first three films, which all featured the cinematography of Douglas Slocombe, a legend in the field who was nominated for three Academy Awards across a career that saw him work on everything from <em>The Italian Job</em> to <em>Rollerball </em>to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> to <em>Close Encounters Of The Third Kind</em>.</p><p>It's the latter where Slocombe first met Steven Spielberg, and the director was so impressed that he brought Slocombe on to work on 1981's <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, a film that Spielberg thought he had very specific noir-like ideas for, but whose look ultimately gave way to something else when running into Slocombe's penchant for practical considerations and high contrast shooting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Beauty Of Indiana Jones" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zZaIvckiqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Spielberg recalled this transition in 2017,<a href="https://theasc.com/articles/flashback-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-directing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in a feature he wrote for American Cinematographer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I originally wanted a much moodier, almost neo-Brechtian style of light and shadow for this film. I wanted the film to resemble more, say The Informer — the film being more film noir than I eventually accomplished. But I found that the movie was beginning to paint itself out of the corner I put it in, by the kind of sketchy brightness which is Dougie's forte and I began to see what Dougie was doing. He was giving it a fuller look, not a flat look; he was giving it a very nice backlit look, but a very full backlit look and because of that he was getting amazing depth of field due to the number of lights he was using. In the dailies, of course, it looks very dark and moody and atmospheric, while on the set it looked very bright, but he was not shooting wide open, to say the least. He was stopping down. So between my original discussions with Dougie about film noir and subsequent results from our collaboration, and seeing a couple of days' dailies that looked kind of sketchy — very sketchy — perhaps film noir, and then seeing other scenes that were fatter and richer in contrast, I began to say, "Hey, this movie is much prettier in color than it is in black-and-white."</p><p>I believe that the photographic style of this movie happened by itself through an interesting compromise between what Dougie loves to do and what I wanted from him. We each came halfway and we found what will now be, hopefully, the continuing style of the Raiders saga.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The result was a trilogy with a visual style so distinctive that Slocombe was nominated for an Oscar in 19081 for his work on <em>Raiders</em>, and one so memorable that someone like me with only a passing knowledge of the films and the people who made them could look at <em>Great Circle's</em> cutscenes and think, boy, they sure do look like they're shot exactly the same as those movies they're based on. Just like the early films, <em>Great Circle</em> features a ton of heavy contrast, a lot of incredibly moody lighting relying on candles and sunlight, loads of thick shadows and plenty of very, very close shots of Indiana's face.</p><p><em>Raiders</em> went on to become Slocombe's most recognised work (<a href="https://britishcinematographer.co.uk/douglas-slocombe-obe-bsc-raiders-of-the-lost-arc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it cost him the use of one eye after a freak jeep accident!</a>) and while he's sadly no longer with us--<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/douglas-slocombe-obituary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he lived until the grand old age of 103, only passing away in 2016</a>--the fact he left behind such a legacy while being self-taught is incredible. How many other cinematographers do you even <em>know</em>, let alone could so quickly point to the visual signature they've left behind on modern pop culture?</p><p>It's impossible to play <em>Great Circle</em> and not see Machinegames' best attempts at building on that legacy. Just look at some of these shots! Most are from cutscenes where the inspiration can be most literally seen, but there are even moments during gameplay when some light pours through a mysterious tomb's door and you think, uh huh, this is <em>Indiana Jones</em> all right. When you're watching something like this and John Williams' score kicks in and Troy Baker is channelling Harrison Ford you realise this isn't just something cashing in on a beloved license, it genuinely understands every aspect of it and feels like a continuation that could have involved Spielberg and George Lucas themselves.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I've read reviews of this game that are almost critical of <em>Great Circle's </em>cutscenes; they wish this had been a movie and not a game, or that the cutscenes had focused less on action scenes and allowed the player more agency over them. I think Machinegames got the balance just right, because the cutscenes here don't feel like a lesser version of Indy's story, they feel like a thoughtful continuation of it, in ways infinitely preferable to sitting down and watching the last two dogshit movies.</p><p><em>Great Circle</em> is an adaptation so considerate and understanding of the source material that it didn't just stop at copying Indy's voice and hat, it made sure his mannerisms were correct,<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that his limitations were made clear</a>, that the music was perfect and that down to the most minute, oft-overlooked detail--like the lens through which we view the action and the cutscenes--it understood what made Indiana Jones <em>Indiana Jones</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
