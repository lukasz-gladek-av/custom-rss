Even with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">Switch 2 confirmed to be in the works</a>, it’s still worth picking up the original if you don’t already have one. Now through May 31st, there’s a great chance to scoop one up at a lower price than you’ll find at retail. </p><p>You could go with a refurbished unit of the handheld-only <strong>Switch Lite</strong>, for example, which is down to $160.99 ($39 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/nintendo-switch-lite-timmy-tommys-aloha-edition-grade-a-refurbished-1">Woot</a> for a light blue “Timmy and Tommy Aloha” model or $164.95 (about $35 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/nintendo-switch-lite-grade-a-refurbished">Woot</a> for one in coral pink. </p><p>If you anticipate wanting to play on a TV, you can pick up an <strong>original Nintendo Switch</strong> model with a dock and detachable Joy-Con controllers in refurbished condition for $239.99 ($60 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/nintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joycon-grade-a-refurbished-3">Woot</a>. You can also buy the updated LCD model that has improved battery life in new condition with aftermarket packaging for $259.99 ($40 off), also at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/nintendo-switch-v2-with-gray-joycons-new-brown-box">Woot</a>. Each purchase includes Woot’s 90-day limited warranty.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch might not get all of the same AAA gaming experiences that the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S do, but there’s a healthy mix of new releases in the pipeline. You’ll also get to explore an expansive back catalog, which features first-party blockbusters like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pok</em>é<em>mon Legends: Arceus</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>. </p><div><p>There are also tons of third-party titles, a horde of remakes and remasters like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch">newly released <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151970/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch-release-date">retro collections</a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592549/nintendo-switch-online-retro-subscription-game-boy-gba">classic titles from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, and N64</a> that are included as part of a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fswitch%2Fonline%2F">Switch Online membership</a> (starting at $3.99 a month or $19.99 a year).</p></div><div><p>Nintendo’s smaller, lighter 5.5-inch Switch makes it easier to play your collection of Switch games on the go. It can’t, however, connect to TVs or play games that require detachable Joy-Con controllers.</p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch offers a 6.2-inch touchscreen, three play styles, and a Wi-Fi connection, thus enabling multiplayer gaming (with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription).</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>More deals for the big holiday weekend</h3></p><div><ul><li>If you’re in the Philips Hue smart lighting ecosystem, the brand’s <strong>Play HDMI Sync Box</strong> could be a fun addition. Now down to a record-low $174.99 ($75 off) from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips-hue.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhue-play-hdmi-sync-box-%2F046677555221">Philips</a>, the box lets you plug in up to four HDMI sources, allowing your lights to match colors with the content you watch or respond to the beat of what you listen to. It supports 4K HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision content at refresh rates up to 60Hz, so it may not be the best fit for newer gaming consoles if you need to play up to 144Hz (though it does support the faster refresh rate if you play in 1440p). It does require the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips-hue.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhue-bridge%2F046677458478">Hue Bridge</a>, which adds another $59.99 to your purchase if you don’t already have one.</li><li><strong>Sony’s affordable WH-CH520 wireless headphones</strong> are down to around $38 (about $22 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1PRC4L?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmjNbMUEDnZ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WH-CH520-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-with-Microphone-Black%2F2247478998">Walmart</a>, matching their all-time low. The affordable on-ear headphones can’t exactly compare to a more substantial pair like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review">Sony’s WH-1000XM5</a> or even the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS1QCFHX?tag=theverge02-20">WH-CH720N</a>, but that’s to be expected considering the staggering cost difference. You’ll miss out on noise cancellation and some other advanced features, and they might not be quite as comfy as their more expensive siblings. However, the WH-CH520 should offer solid sound quality in a pinch, and the battery is rated to last up to an impressive 50 hours. You’ll also get Bluetooth multipoint for seamless multi-device switching, fast pairing with Google Find My Device support, and voice-activated Google Assistant and Siri.</li><li>There’s a rare sale going on for <strong>Adobe’s Creative Cloud Photography plan </strong>with 1TB of cloud storage.

<p>After arriving on Wednesday, Wuthering Waves was <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777">beset by issues</a> around player logins - with some players unable to log in at all, while others were forced to log back in whenever they relaunched the game on PC - and performance issues ranging from from lags and freezes to low frame rates and straight-up crashes. (Whether related to these specific complaints or not, our own James detailed his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-really-really-doesnt-want-to-run-on-steam-deck">extensive efforts to get the game to even boot on a Steam Deck</a>, to no avail.)</p>
<p>Kuro have raced to fix the problems by issuing a series of hotfixes that have so far sorted the login issues, along with promising that patches to address the performance troubles and complaints about the game’s localised text are also in the works.</p>
<p>Slightly longer-term, the studio have now offered a look at some other improvements on the way, which are more aimed at overall game experience than technical woes.</p>
<p>The list of future plans includes improvements to the game’s current system for skipping scenes, both increasing the number of in-game scenes that can be skipped during the game’s story and resigning the button in the UI to make it easier to find. While Kuro cites “technical constraints” as making full cutscenes unable to be skipped, the optimised system should still make it easier to whizz through the main quest outside of cinematics.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Rovers,<br>After yesterday's post, we have some new updates to share with you regarding our future plans for game improvements.<br>- We plan to make every type of story content skippable in future updates, giving you more control over your gameplay. Most of the story content will…</p>— Wuthering Waves (@Wuthering_Waves) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1794025519521972554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The other incoming change is to combat, with Kuro planning to “optimise the combat experience” by adding more visual responses for attacks, stopping objects in the environment blocking the view of battles and doing a better job of providing feedback on combat actions.</p>
<p>Those headline changes will join with other assorted optimisations, fixes and “new functions and gameplay elements” in the works, with better maps, NPC artwork and Echo transformations all mentioned as being somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>To apologise for the issues so far, Kuro will give players who are Union Level 2 or higher by July 3rd ten Radiant Tide items. That joins a second item, a Voucher of Reciprocal Tides, which will be available for the next year as sorry for “the unsatisfactory experience” of the Beginner's Choice Convene; the item gives you the chance to grab one 5-star Standard Resonator of your choice for free.</p>
<p>I can’t honestly pretend to know exactly what all that means, having not delved into Wuthering Waves properly myself yet, but free stuff is always nice, right?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-4-cheats-codes">The Sims 4</a> is fast approaching its 10th birthday this September, a fact that genuinely instilled me with the crushing sense of time marching relentlessly on when I checked its release date a moment ago. That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>The game’s developers over at EA are as aware of this as anyone, and they’re now looking to step up their efforts in blowing out some of the dust, oiling the gears and getting the wonderful interlocking machinery at the heart of the PC modern-classic (is 10 years old enough to justify as a classic? It feels apt here) to purr along smoothly again.</p>
<p>To do so, the devs have put together a whole new team to focus on tackling bugs, fixing technical troubles, improving performance and just generally improving the overall experience of playing, acknowledging that there are a number of outstanding problems that have “caused much frustration” for fans. In essence, the presence of the new team should mean more fixes for both big and small issues reported by the community - <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024">as tracked on the team’s ‘Laundry List’ of requests</a> - landing at a more regular clip than before.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Specifically, the team say that updates should now land every two months or so, starting with an update later this month that should include fixes for pairing nose rings and brow piercings, seasonal weed-growing, and an error relating to summoning a Grilled Cheese (cheese toastie, please), among many others. Ah, god bless The Sims. The game’s next patch will then look to optimise memory use to reduce crashes, up frame rates and generally boost responsiveness and performance, with patch notes that are probably a bit less entertaining to read.</p>
<p>The team’s announcement vows that “our team is more dedicated than ever to developing great The Sims 4 gameplay experiences into the foreseeable future” - the formation of this team certainly seems to speak to that, especially with not-officially-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-everything-we-know">aka Project Rene</a> still appearing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-rene-aka-the-sims-5-shows-prototype-lighting-animation-routines-in-latest-video">be a good ways off</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-series-reveal-reportedly-coming-soon-as-may-playstation-showcase-rumors-persist.880776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There have been a lot of quality first-party PlayStation 5 games, but perhaps the most underappreciated is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro’s Playroom</a>. Sure, it was just a relatively small-scale pack-in title, but Astro’s Playroom was a ton of fun and made better use of the Dualsense controller’s unique features than any game since.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to reliable leaker Billbil-kun</a>, a new entry in the Astro series, simply titled Astro Bot, is in the works at Team Asobi and will be revealed sometime within the next 15 days. Billbil-kun hints that the game may have multiple playable characters, including one that looks like a fennec fox, and may have multiple themed environments, including a desert-y level. Fingers crossed for a larger-scale game of similar quality as Astro’s Playroom.</p>
<p>While our leaker doesn’t explicitly state it, if seems likely the Astro Bot reveal will coincide with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new PlayStation Showcase rumored for May</a>. Jeff Grubb was the one that initially started the rumor, and he’s stuck to his guns since, and <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793156746976039017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shpeshal Nick</a> has since chimed in to say he’s heard the showcase will happen somewhere around May 28. Of course, take this all with a grain of salt for now, but it certainly seems like some sort of PlayStation show is coming, even if perhaps happens in early June instead of late May.</p>
<p>While Sony has stated they won’t be releasing any “major franchise” titles this fiscal year (which runs until the end of March 2025), that doesn’t mean big third-party exclusives and smaller, more experimental first-party titles might now be on the way. In addition to Astro Bot, we’ve already heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-firewalk-studios-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firewalk Studios’ new multiplayer shooter IP Concord may soon be fully revealed</a>, so it seems like the upcoming PlayStation Showcase may be a good one for those missing Sony’s quirkier, more original side.</p>
<p>What do you think? Excited for the possible return of Astro Bot? Personally, I still consider Astro’s Playroom one of my favorite PS5 exclusives, so I’m surprisingly hyped.</p>

Even better, it won’t take up 200 GB on your hard drive. </p><div data-video-id="196909" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Actor Alan Tudyk On Game Adaptations &amp; Voicing Hapless Halo Characters" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="196909,191130,195840" data-current="196909"><div><p>Actor Alan Tudyk On Game Adaptations &amp; Voicing Hapless Halo Characters</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196909/196909_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196909/196909_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196909/196909_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196909/196909_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22467.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>It’s practically impossible to talk about <em>XDefiant </em>without mentioning <em>Call of Duty</em>. The games share a lot in common and it’s clear that Ubisoft wants this new free-to-play shooter—out now on consoles and PC—to compete with Activision’s juggernaut military FPS.<br></p><p>Ubisoft isn’t the first publisher to try and take on the beast that is <em>Call of Duty</em>, but its approach isn’t just to be a carbon copy of modern <em>CoD</em> (but free). Instead, <em>XDefiant </em>strips back a lot of the digital bloat and annoying nonsense—like multiple game installs and extra modes—that have made <em>Call of Duty </em>into a hard-to-parse disaster for newcomers or returning players. This simplifying of the <em>CoD </em>formula applies to gameplay, too.<br></p><h2 id="h236"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast and deadly</strong></h2><p>Maps in <em>XDefiant </em>are smaller than a lot of modern <em>CoD </em>playgrounds and are built around objective-focused game modes. This helps funnel you into action and keeps <em>XDefiant </em>feeling fast and exciting.<br></p><p>Also helping to keep the speed up is how quickly you move in <em>XDefiant</em>. Pulling out your handgun makes you run like a world-class sprinter, and you can slide and hop around the map like a bunny being chased by a hungry wolf. Characters in <em>XDefiant</em> are extremely nimble and responsive, reminding me more of how<em> Call of Duty</em> played during the Xbox 360-era of the franchise. Time to kill is also a bit higher than in some other modern shooters, giving you a chance to escape or turn around to fight back.<br></p><p>Outside of combat, <em>XDefiant </em>sports a handful of modes, a dozen or so guns, some attachments, and abilities, and that’s it. You can create custom classes using characters from other Ubisoft games—like the rebels from <em>Far Cry 6</em> who specialize in healing, or <em>Splinter Cell</em> agents with invisible camo—but this process is pretty streamlined. </p><p>I didn’t feel overwhelmed by options, and while future updates and seasons will add more, <em>XDefiant</em> feels designed to be easy to hop into and have fun. And I appreciate that.<br></p><h2 id="h237"><a id=""></a><strong>Small is good</strong></h2><p>This may seem weird to note, but a big advantage <em>XDefiant </em>has over so many other modern multiplayer shooters is the digital footprint of the game. On my Xbox Series X, <em>XDefiant</em> takes up just over 30 GB of space, which isn’t tiny, sure, but compared to <em>Battlefield 2042</em> (90+ GB) and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/17zpvgo/is_it_normal_for_warzone_to_take_138_gb_on_xbox/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/17zpvgo/is_it_normal_for_warzone_to_take_138_gb_on_xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Call of Duty MW3/Warzon</em>e</a></span> (130+ GB), it’s pretty small. You likely won’t have to delete a few games just to install <em>XDefiant</em>, which is nice in 2024.</p><p>At this point, <em>XDefiant </em>has laid down a solid foundation for an online FPS. Combat feels snappy and fun, the maps are well made and look nice, and the game isn’t too big and feels focused on keeping players in the action and not in menus. What’s here is solid and I’m excited to play more.</p><figure id="" data-id="779580ae9108cd15aacdc008dd5f66da" data-recommend-id="image://779580ae9108cd15aacdc008dd5f66da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows a character from XDefiant wearing a gas mask.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, the key to <em>XDefiant’s </em>success is now up to Ubisoft and its developers. Today, games like this can’t just launch and be done. <em>XDefiant </em>will have to get fresh content at a regular pace—like new maps and characters—to have a chance against the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wasteland-fallout-magneto-1851499167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wasteland-fallout-magneto-1851499167"><em>Fortnite</em>s<em> </em>and <em>Call of Duty</em>s of the world</a></span>.<br></p><p>I can’t see into the future—if I could I’d not be writing about games for a living. My lack of clairvoyance means that I can’t tell you if a year from now <em>XDefiant </em>will be doing well and getting new content or if Ubisoft fails to keep the game active and it dies. </p><p>I hope that <em>XDefiant </em>has a long future ahead of it. The game is good and I’m happy to have a modern arena shooter back in my life that isn’t bogged down by battle royale nonsense, too many modes, or massive installs. But only time will tell if <em>XDefiant </em>succeeds, or if it joins so many other games that tried and failed to compete with <em>Call of Duty. </em><br></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With no real demand put upon me as a player, there was nothing for me to push back against, no enjoyable texture or sense of accomplishment, and so I moved on. Now, however, I’m in a different place, one where a pleasant, low-key journey through a vast and beautiful world sounds appealing, so I’m approaching it with a different mindset. I’m thinking of it more as a way to unwind after a long day at work like I might with a good book, rather than as a game I come to for challenges I can overcome. (I’m well aware that the game, with its tough dungeons and raids, has plenty of challenging encounters and opportunities for skillful play if that’s what you want. But it’s the quality of the story campaigns that I’ve heard so much about, so that’s primarily what I want to experience, at least to start.)</p><p><br>And so far, <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>is proving to be a lovely, pleasantly low-pressure experience. I log on sometime in the evenings, play a few main story quests (and whatever side quests I can gather along the way), and just enjoy being in Eorzea and seeing my marauder continue her journey to becoming the Warrior of Light. The world, with its elegant cities and vast countryside, is distinctive and fun to explore, and though I mostly tend to keep to myself, the community seems very pleasant and positive.

So far grimly unnoticed by the games press, this is a bloody brilliant <em>Zelda</em>-like, presented in monochrome chunky pixels, with a sublime journey delivered through new skills opening up new areas.</p><p>It’s monstrously clever about it all, encouraging widespread exploration to discover how your latest upgrade unlocks entire new dungeons where previously you thought there was only a plain wall, and boss fights are scrupulously fair. It’s wordless, but the game’s smattering of NPCs communicate in the simplest of image-based speech bubbles, letting me weave my own narrative and motivations for everything that’s going on.</p><p><br>And despite the <em>reasonably</em> small map, it’s enormous, multi-layered and bulging with secrets. It’s such a brilliantly refined delivery of the old-school <em>Zelda</em> format, streamlined to its purest excellence, and most importantly, has a hookshot <em>and</em> boomerang. Those are worth 20 percentage points each, ensuring an already great game scores at around the 124 percent mark. — John Walker  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-recommend-id="image://e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-recommend-id="image://e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Give it just one more chance to see if we work well together</p><p>Here I am again, wondering if I can put up with a FromSoft game of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s caliber. No, I’m not good at these kinds of games generally speaking. I’ve played various Soulslikes to mixed results (I <em>did</em> finish all of <em>The Surge</em>). But I do get curious from time to time. A friend of mine suggested I start with <em>Demon’s Souls</em> on PS5. That idea is enticing...but with the new <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC coming in a month, I feel a sense of urgency here.</p><p>Well, I haven’t learned my lesson, it would seem. I am presently redownloading <em>Elden Ring</em>. Am I going to continue with my old character I abandoned in 2022? Maybe?

But now May is nearly over and I am pretty sure I’ve played all the new releases I want to, so it’s time to get serious. </p><p><br>Thankfully, this weekend seems like the perfect time for me to do a marathon through the story.

So this time, for real, I am going to complete <em>Endwalker</em>. However, to be realistic I think I might just commit to beating the main story and leave the post-<em>Endwalker</em> patch content for another time. — Willa Rowe <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-recommend-id="image://96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eve stands next to her drone while waiting on an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eve stands next to her drone while waiting on an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-recommend-id="image://96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eve stands next to her drone while waiting on an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Explore the last remaining city of Xion</p><p><em>Stellar Blade</em> is everything I want out of a game right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-double-xp-weekend/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>To celebrate the successful launch of XDefiant, Ubisoft has rolled out a Double XP weekend – and it’s live now. From today through May 28, players can jump onto the free-to-play, multi-platform first-person shooter and rack up twice as much weapon XP as normal. That means you’ll unlock those all-important guns and their game-changing attachments much faster. </p>



<p>It was recently revealed that within just two hours of going live, XDefiant amassed more than one million players – a stunning result for a game that was delayed several times in a few months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-double-time">Double Time</h2>



<p>Ubisoft’s XDefiant was supposed to have been released towards the end of summer 2023, but it never materialised due to technical and regulatory issues. It would be pushed back a few more times before hitting the open market on May 21, launching to a positive reception and huge overnight growth. It topped streaming charts and became the talk of the town as players far and wide leapt in to experience this relatively unique shooter.</p>



<p>Now, those players can take advantage of Double XP – on weapons:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate launch week, we're offering Double XP on weapons! It all starts Friday at 10AM PT/ 1PM ET and continues through the weekend until Tuesday at 10AM PT/ 1PM ET. <a href="https://t.co/yiWv6yw8Ml">pic.twitter.com/yiWv6yw8Ml</a></p>— XDefiant (@PlayXDefiant) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1793771759214231701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>I’ve sunk a bit of time into XDefiant, and I’m extremely pleased with what’s on offer. It looks great on the surface, runs well, and the gunplay and movement mechanics are top-tier. There are plenty of characters to assume control of, with the game being based on a ‘factions’ operating model – but the twist here is that the factions are based on Ubisoft’s line-up of games, such as Splinter Cell, The Division, and Far Cry.</p>



<p>Are you going to take advantage of the Double XP weekend in XDefiant?</p>

<!-- cache hit 121:single/related:3fa573760bda8cdd29f4a10d474e4698 --><!-- empty -->
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">Asus' ROG Ally</a> was the first major-brand attempt to compete with Valve's Steam Deck. It was beefy and interesting, but it had three major flaws: It ran Windows on a little touchscreen, had unremarkable ergonomics, and its battery life was painful.</p>
<p>The Asus ROG (Republic of Gamers) Ally X, which has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vze62qJK1Sk">announced</a> and is due out June 2, seems to have had its specs leaked, and they indicate a fix for at least the battery life. Gaming site <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-x-specs-leaked-24gb-lpddr5x-7500-memory-and-massive-80-wh-battery">VideoCardz</a>, starting its leak reveal with "No more rumors," cites the ROG Ally X as having the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU as the prior ROG Ally, as well as the same 7-inch 1080p VRR screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate.
</p><figure><figcaption><p>VideoCardz' leaked image, seemingly from Asus marketing materials, with the ROG Ally X's specifications.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The battery and memory have changed substantially, though. An 80-watt-hour battery, up from 40, somehow adds just 70 grams of weight and about 5 mm of thickness to the sequel device. By increasing the RAM from 16GB to 24GB and making it LPDDR5, the ROG Ally X may be able to lend more of it to the GPU, upping performance somewhat without demanding a new chip or architecture. There is also a second USB-C port, with USB4 speeds, that should help quite a bit with docking, charging while playing with accessories, and, I would guess, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/3/">Linux hackery</a>.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>How does it feel? Only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on">Sean Hollister at The Verge knows</a>, outside of ASUS employees. The sequel has lost the weirdly sharp angles on the back, and more of your hand fits around the back, without the rear buttons being accidentally triggered so easily. The triggers and buttons all seem to have received some feedback-based upgrades to durability and feel.</p>
<p>If Asus sticks close to the $800 price point (that <a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1789672436918538420">was also leaked</a>), it could compete with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">Steam Deck OLED</a> on features and flash, if not library and polish. But as I've said before, perhaps somewhat defensively, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">bring on the flashier handheld PCs</a>.
</p><p>Expanding the viability of handheld PC gaming means more developers targeting these systems, in specs or just accessibility. More demand for new types of handhelds makes the whole field more interesting and competitive. Microsoft, which is keenly aware of this developing market and is contemplating a more cloud-based and less Xbox-centered gaming future, can only make Windows better on handhelds&nbsp;because the bar is pretty low right now.</p>
<p>All of that gives me more games to play on the couch while the rice is cooking, whether or not the device I'm holding has more and faster RAM and better USB-C ports than my gaming PC.</p>

Titled "Wrecked," Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 follows <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/08/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-begins-today-with-new-skins-locations-weapons-and-more">last season's Greek Gods-themed season</a> with a new battle pass, new weapons and skins, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the&nbsp;<strong>wasteland</strong>," an Epic Games <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/crash-the-party-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked">blog post</a> reads. "The 'Wasteland Warriors' have already called shotgun on owning the place (they did ride in with the sandstorm, after all). This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they've already established."&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'll break down those new locations and more below.&nbsp;</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="df53e7cc-25bb-482d-ba38-bfe516715028" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Let's start with the battle pass. It features some newly made characters by Epic Games, known as original skins within the Fortnite community, and some collaboration skins in the form of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic Fallout series and infamous X-Men villain, Magneto.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out all the skins in the battle pass below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="73b9cc0a-ae4a-4fe6-a343-e7a8a7bb8c7b" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>New Points of Interest</h4>

<p>One of the first new points of interest, or map locations, is <strong>Redline Rig</strong>. It's a Nitro refinery run by The Machinist, the Wasteland Warriors' master mechanic who is also available in the battle pass.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ec2edcc6-2f0b-4f74-a12c-128f6d77ddb5" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Also in the south of the island is&nbsp;<strong>Nitrodrome</strong>. Here, Ringmaster Scarr, who is available in the battle pass, runs the circus-like car spectacle known as the Nitrodrome.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="53db0164-b26f-4a23-be0a-4dac377e2ceb" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>From the Nitrodrome, you can easily reach&nbsp;<strong>Brutal Beachhead.&nbsp;</strong>Here, Megalo Don is the person in charge. He's the Wasteland Warriors' "master muscle," according to the blog post, and taking him on won't be easy.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fa00f8f1-e4a6-4c51-9db3-f8aa037a5af8" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Epic says there are other changes to locations on the map, though. For example, Snooty Steppes is now&nbsp;<strong>Sandy Steppes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Going Nitro</h4>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3e46ceab-4f57-47af-81f7-26035cc6e241" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Across the Island, you'll find <strong>Nitro Splash</strong> and <strong>Nitro Barrels</strong>, both from Redline Rig. Nitro Splash is a portable version of a Nitro container, which you can throw down to infuse you or your car with Nitro for a fiery boost. Nitro Barrels are Nitro containers that "Nitro-fy" on contact, and when you hit them, they'll fly away and explode on landing.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="85a68bda-4846-474b-990d-3e61e15c089b" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p><strong>Here's how Nitro works in Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 – Wrecked:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Vehicles</strong> that are Nitro-fied get a driving speed increase, explosive ramming power that deals damage and knockback, fuel consumption decrease, and a buff to attached attack mods.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Players</strong> that are Nitro-fied get a movement speed increase, explosive bashing power that deals damage and knockback (and it can bust through builds), a stamina&nbsp;consumption decrease, a reload speed increase, and fall damage immunity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h4>New Weapons And More</h4>

<p>One of the new additions to the Battle Royale fight are the <strong>Nitro Fists</strong>, which allow you to perform a three-punch combo, uppercut, or aerial punch that dashes you through the air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nitro Fists have four charges, and each charge recharges every eight seconds. The uppercut and aerial punch use one charge each, while the three-punch combo uses none. If you aerial punch the ground instead of the air, "the impact will be meteoric to surrounding enemies," Epic writes in the blog post.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Boom Bolt</strong>&nbsp;is a new fast-firing, moddable crossbow that fires explosive bolts. A few shots can take down a vehicle, Epic says.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c262e7f0-4682-45f6-bf08-ec958bb4f0da" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">

	<li>Combat Shotgun</li>

            <p>In a year already stacking up plates of delicious indie game dishes so fast they’re toppling over and crashing onto the floor, spilling splattered food over the carpet to be hoovered up by waiting dogs/cats/raccoons/mice, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> is one of the most generous helpings yet. The captivating, combat-free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a> is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Basso took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1cybe5t/we_are_billy_basso_and_dan_adelman_creator_of/">Nintendo Switch subreddit for an AMA</a> (well spotted, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/animal-well-developer-billy-basso-hints-at-a-new-game-that-will-be-in-the-same-universe-but-may-not-be-a-direct-sequel/">PC Gamer</a>), throwing up some fun tidbits about Animal Well’s development, plans for the future and - of course - a few teases of secrets yet to be fully uncovered.</p>
<p>Though some mysteries remain - with Basso refusing to comment on whether one particular item can be reached without using glitches, while teasing that other supposed secrets might be mere red herrings - the developer admitted that players had torn through the puzzles much quicker than he expected: “They have been solving them way faster then [sic] I was expecting. I am very flattered people care that much.”</p>
<p>In the case of the <span tabindex="0">time capsule</span> - one of the game’s most elaborate and difficult puzzles, which unlocks what some suspect to be its true ‘final’ ending - players were able to crack it in the first week. Basso expressed relief that the solution was found without being reverse-engineered by datamining the game’s files, saying: “I found it extremely impressive! [...] They just solved it legitimately way faster than I ever could have imagined.”</p>

 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While Animal Well is likely to keep players busy for a while still - even as some folks are now <a href="https://youtu.be/QQ7ULQaYv4E">speedrunning it in under four minutes</a> - Basso is looking ahead to what comes next. In terms of whether that might be a full Animal Well sequel, the developer simply isn’t sure yet - but the aim is for his next game to be set in the same creature-filled world, at least.</p>
<p>“There will never be any DLC for animal well. If I do work on something else related to it, it will be a new game,” Basso confirmed to one comment, clarifying that there might be updates for “minor bug fixes” and the like. He then expanded on the idea of a follow-up to another by revealing “I'm currently planning to make a game that will be in the same "universe" but may not be a direct sequel.” (“cannot say,” Basso replied bluntly to another question about a sequel.)</p>
<p>Whatever comes next might at least build on what lore can be found in the first game, with Basso saying he focused on gameplay and visuals as the “main priority” of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> - something that comes through in its minimalist storytelling and world-building - but teased that “there is lore that I had in mind while making the game, including some very specific details that the community hasn't pieced together yet”. Best get back to solving those puzzles, then!</p>
<p>Oh, if you’re wondering: Basso’s favourite item is the <span tabindex="0">slinky</span>, having found some of the puzzles designed around it among the most satisfying to design. A very fine choice, even if the <span tabindex="0">raising platforms room during the ghost dog chase</span> drove me to the point of needing to go outside, stare at nature and take a very long breath of fresh air before trying again.</p>

  <p id="p2tQpA">Rian Johnson, that sly devil, has done it again: He’s gone off and made another mystery in the series that began in 2019 with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/27/20985373/knives-out-review-rian-johnson-daniel-craig-chris-evans-jamie-lee-curtis-don-johnson-ana-de-armas"><em>Knives Out</em></a> and continued in 2022 with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23474865/glass-onion-review-knives-out-sequel-netflix-streaming"><em>Glass Onion</em></a>. The director has promised that Daniel Craig’s effete sleuth Benoit Blanc will return in a new whodunnit next year, and that it’s called <em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em>. But you know what? Don’t bother, Monsieur Blanc. We can solve this one right now. We have all the clues. </p>
<p id="1tpLZY">Consider: The announcement teaser, which shows no footage, but features the previous title cards in the lead-up to the reveal of the new film title. Leading us there is this little trinket, a magnifying glass with a knife’s blade instead of a handle. </p>

<p id="0sMY0R">Or is it… the weapon of <em>murder</em>?! Will the killer in <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> (Arnold Schwarzenegger, I have no doubt) use this to fry his victim (Richard Kind, very upsetting), in an elaborate death trap, like a cruel child scorching an ant? It’s more likely than you think! I bring your attention to exhibit B, Johnson’s X post about the new movie:</p>
<div id="L8wCc9">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love everything about whodunnits, but one of the things I love most is how malleable the genre is. There’s a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies.</p>— Rian Johnson (@rianjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/rianjohnson/status/1794004953700376950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="hR6chT">This makes my horrifying thesis plausible. Here, Johnson is signaling a tonal pivot for <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>, and the gothic typeface of its title card suggests it will be a <em>spooky</em> pivot. Richard Kind’s horrible, nightmare-inducing death will be preceded by a red herring, Schwarzenegger’s faked death at the hands of Gisele Bündchen, in her first feature film role since <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>. She, however, will believe she murdered Arnold accidentally, and spend the movie being haunted by various ghosts (played by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24091333/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-anime-inuyasha">Megan Thee Stallion</a>, Tig Notaro, and, controversially, an AI recreation of Eminem, which is confusing because they could’ve just asked). </p>
<p id="dytlkS">And Benoit Blanc, of course, will spend the entire film puzzling over a Ouija board and writing an original musical. We’ll think this is vital to solving the case, but in fact, he already knew the answer. It’s what they call a shaggy-dog story. Well played, Rian. </p>
<p id="4WuuUi">But if you still want to make this movie, I guess I’ll see it. <em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em> does not have a release date yet, but the teaser says it’ll come to Netflix in 2025.</p>

<p>A new Astro game is in development at Sony by Team Asobi, and an announcement is expected to come over the next two weeks.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reliable data miner billbil-kun</a>, he is of the relief that the game will simply be called “Astro Bot”. He adds that the official announcement of the new game “should be made within 15 days”.</p>



<p>“Among the other information we have obtained, it seems that part of the game will be playable in an&nbsp;environment located in the heart of a desert,” he said. “One of the new characters in this game would be a&nbsp;fennec in the form of a robot&nbsp;sharing some similarities with Astro.”</p>



<p>He adds that a release date and official platforms are currently unknown. However, he believes the game will be exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and not to PS VR2.</p>



<p>The last Astro Bot game, Astro’s Playroom, was released in 2020 and came pre-installed on every PlayStation 5. It was a game that served as a free tech demo, of sorts, for Sony’s new console and new DualSense controller.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade%E2%80%99s-latest-update-adds-boss-challenge-mode-and-new-outfits.880710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-boss-challenge-mode-out-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In the latest Stellar Blade patch – 1.003 – ShiftUp has added content that players have been waiting a good couple of weeks for, with Boss Challenge Mode spearheading the update. Stellar Blade was only released on April 26, but ShiftUp is eager to pump a little more content into the game – which is surprising, given the studio has already confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sales-pc-version/">it’s looking at a sequel</a> or a new title altogether.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fashion-darling">Fashion, Darling</h2>



<p>In patch 1.003, players can secure some new outfits and take advantage of some quality-of-life improvements, including tweaks to the game’s locking-on system and a persistent compass mechanic. That means that you won’t need to endlessly scan using Adam’s drone to keep track of where you are. </p>



<p>The cherry on the pie is the Boss Challenge Mode, which players have been eagerly awaiting since the game was released. Players are now free to arrange their presets and launch into desperate battles against the game’s nineteen boss characters. They’ll receive feedback once they’ve finished said fights, with the challenges looping and encouraging players to improve over time. </p>



<p>If you manage to defeat every boss in the game on Normal difficulty or higher, you’ll unlock an exclusive outfit. It’s kind of like every other outfit in Stellar Blade – we’ll leave it to you to figure out what that means.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade’s 1.003 patch is available to download now exclusively on PlayStation 5.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft is currently working on a fix for XDdefiant's hit detection, as the development team is aware players think that the function is working poorly.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/XDefiantPlay/status/1793784936224420080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1793990260260802899%7Ctwgr%5E01eb36e4886368d34abcf81965c16598a73e48ad%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-working-to-fix-xdefiants-busted-hit-registration" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter users were calling on</a> Ubisoft San Francisco to fix the hit detection in XDefiant, and the game's director, Mark Rubin, responded they it was something that the team was looking into. Hit detection is the game's ability to detect the accuracy of projectiles. In a first-person shooter game like XDefiant, hit detection would be applied to things like bullets.</p><p>XDefiant is Ubisoft's Call of Duty-like game, and Rubin had been a longtime Call of Duty executive. The game also tries to differentiate itself from Activision's popular shooter game by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">not implementing skill-based matchmaking</a>.</p><p>XDefiant launched this week on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

However, Ubisoft San Francisco is continually working on the the game in order to get it into its best shape as it's still in pre-season. XDefiant seems to have gotten off to a hot start, though, as it reportedly reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-launch-reportedly-hit-1-million-players-in-under-3-hours/1100-6523688/" data-ref-id="1100-6523688">1 million players</a> within its first three hours of release.</p>

They offer the first three chapters for free, but require you buy a subscription for the rest. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect from OP 1116 </h2> <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece</em> chapter 1115 revealed a ton of lore surrounding the world of One Piece. For those who haven’t caught up yet, <strong>read the chapter first to avoid the spoilers below. </strong></p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Chapter 1115 revealed that the world government once allied together with others to take down Joy Boy. And in one of the frames, it showcased the kings of the world standing up to fight Joyboy themselves. This helped characterize the previous rulers of the world while also highlighting Joyboy’s overwhelming presence. </p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">Dr. Vegapunk’s dying speech shocked the world, and his leftover versions of himself continued to help the Straw Hat escape. This chapter created speculation in the community regarding the history surrounding both Joyboy and the world around him. One fan theorized that Imu might be a manifestation of the combined souls of the original 20 kings. To find out more regarding this theory, check the Reddit link below. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="false">It’s very difficult to predict what Oda has planned next, but it doesn’t seem as if Vegapunk’s video message is quite done. In all likelihood, <em>One Piece</em> chapter 1116 will continue Vegapunk’s broadcast, while shining light on the Strawhat Crew’s activities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/stellar-blade-update-1003-boss-challenge-patch-notes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> update 1.003 is here, bringing with it a new Boss Challenge mode, some new Nano Suits and quality of life improvements to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> exclusive.</p>
<p>Boss Challenge will present you with all 19 bosses from the main game, though you need to have defeated them all in the story mode before you can face them again, and can do so at Hard difficulty after you’ve seen the end of the game.</p>


<p>You can take on the boss rush with either your own gear from the story, or with several presets, from the “minimum” through to a maximum preset with all skills and stats buffed. Then, at the end of a run you’ll see various stats like battle time, perfect parries and dodges, consumables and more.</p>
<p>Defeating all bosses in Boss Challenge will earn you the Neurolink Suit.</p>
<p>Speaking of suits, there’s two colour variants of another new Nano Suit. The White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi, will be available for all in this update.</p>


<p>Rounding out the update are some quality of life improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you switch to ranged attack mode and switch back while locked on to an enemy, you will automatically lock on to the enemy again.</li>
<li>An option to always show the compass in the HUD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stellar Blade is a good, solid action game from Shift Up, blending together high action a la Bayonetta and Nier Automata, and some great PS5 visuals. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/stellar-blade-review/">Stellar Blade review</a>, “Stellar Blade is a pretty enjoyable game to swing your hairband sword at, so long as you don’t mind the obvious sexualisation. There’s a few rough areas, but nothing to spoil things overall and there’s plenty of interesting story to uncover as you fight your way through giant monsters with circular saws for heads and weird tentacles for legs.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/praise-the-emperor-space-marine-2-wont-have-microtransactions.880683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive have confirmed that the upcoming shooter won't feature any kind of microtransactions or cash shop.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4192364930208269562" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the first post of a new Community Update series on Steam</a>, the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is intended to be "an experience tailor-crafted for the players", and so "all gameplay content and features will be free to all players".</p>

<p>There could well be paid DLC for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, but it'll be "cosmetic only", according to the devs, so you won't have to worry about players paying to unlock better weapons or gear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-ultramarine.jpg?itok=ARBx3tzA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-ultramarine.jpg?itok=OBnEtzcI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>won't feature any microtransactions whatsoever.</figcaption></figure><p>The post also provides a rundown for the three main gameplay modes in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, for which we received more details during yesterday's&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>Skulls event.</p>

<p>First up, the campaign will allow you to play as Lieutenant Titus as he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-shows-spectacular-tyranid-carnage-in-extensive-gameplay">slaughters hordes of Tyranid foes</a>. The campaign will also support co-op, with up to two friends being able to join you as additional Ultramarine warriors.</p>

<p>The second mode is Operations, a PvE-focused mode in which you'll play as a custom Space Marine. Six character classes will be available, and you'll work in a team alongside other players to "defeat various xeno abominations".</p>

<p>Finally, Eternal War is a player-versus-player mode that sees the forces of the Imperium doing battle with the legions of Chaos. Each faction will be represented by a team of six in Eternal War matches.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-killing-tyranids.jpg?itok=WluLdFrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-killing-tyranids.jpg?itok=yQ1ZDAU9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are gonna be a lot of dead Tyranids by the time you're through with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of the next few months, Focus and Saber will release new info including "many cool and diverse trailers", as well as plenty of screenshots and some short videos showcasing some of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s unique features.</p>

<p>All of this will happen in the lead-up to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003330" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/9n9pczwhvp2l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 9th.

<p>...and here’s a resplendent bullet-point breakdown of the 1.0 launch from publishers Hooded Horse, who are elsewhere notorious for inflicting feudal village-coddler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> upon the world. You know the old proverb: you can lead a Hooded Horse to communism, but you cannot make it seize the means of production. Yeah, I don’t really know where I’m going with that. It’s dialectics at a standstill, maybe. Perhaps we should allocate more resources to infrastructure, to get dialectics moving again.</p>
<blockquote><p>- New buildings to enrich the lives of citizens through entertainment and fitness, including the amphitheater, and a large stadium.</p>
<p>- Additional playgrounds for the younger generation to stay healthy.</p>
<p>- Brand new Western vehicles to expand the nation’s transit network.</p>
<p>- Revamped education system to maximize the potential reach of teachers.</p>
<p>- Graphical improvements to the electronics components factory, woodcutting post, sawmill, panels factory, and many more key buildings.</p>
<p>- Improved factory connection nodes to facilitate a better flow of resources across complex production chains.</p>
<p>- Plenty of other quality-of-life fixes and HUD tweaks.</p></blockquote>
<p>I only know about Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic thanks to Sin Vega, who has written some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-dont-krai-for-me-in-workers-and-resources">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-ostriv-workers-resources-and-where-town-builders-ought-to-go-next">glorious</a> things about it and the light it shines on other city-builders. It's been going down well on celebrated socialist platform Steam, and I see no reason why that won't continue once it hits the big 1.0.</p>

			<p>PS5 exclusive <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/stellar-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade</a> has dropped its first update since launch, and it serves up a hearty helping of new features, quality-of-life improvements, and fan service. The biggest addition is the new Boss Challenge mode, which developer Shift Up describes thusly…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFstellarblade13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“The Boss Challenge pits you against the 19 bosses from the base game. Hone your skills, outwit your enemies… and then brutalize them. Progression in the Boss Challenge requires battle data from bosses you’ve previously defeated. You can also fight bosses on Hard difficulty setting after you’ve seen the ending of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>You can either load up and use your own gear you’ve been using or choose one of several presets. Choose the minimum preset for a true challenge, which is extremely understated, or the maximum preset, which has all of your skills and stats buffed up, if you want to taunt the boss with some spectacular combat. After the challenge is over, your battle data is automatically analyzed. You’ll see metrics like battle time, number of perfect parries and dodges, consumable usage, and more. Test your skills and compare with your friends.”</em></p>
<p>Those who complete the boss rush, unlock the new Neurolink Suit. Another couple “Kunoichi” Nano Suits have also been added to the game. You can check those out below (the Neurolink Suit is the one with the red pants).</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing – when Stellar Blade launched, some players noticed that, <em>gasp</em>, minor changes had been made to some outfits following the game’s Day 1 patch. Suddenly, those who had been championing Stellar Blade as a return to games as they ought to be were raging about “censorship.” The game’s director stated these changes were just artistic tweaks, not censorship, which seems perfectly believable given the game shipped with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-skin-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Skin Suit”</a> that literally makes the main character Eve look nude. Shift Up clearly isn’t afraid of a little titillation. But regardless, this update also quietly adds another couple outfits that are essentially the original versions of the altered outfits (in fact, they seem to be even a bit <em>more </em>revealing). So, enjoy! But also, maybe leave Shift Up alone now?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFstellarblade12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Meanwhile, here are <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1793675715625533593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some other things included in the update 1.003</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed bugs such as unplayable sections, events not triggering, and trophies not being awarded.</em></li>
<li><em>Added an auto-lock-on option when exiting ranged mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Added option to always show the compass in HUD.</em></li>
<li><em>Slightly increased the time limit for puzzles.</em></li>
<li><em>Many other improvements have been made to the controls, balance, and more.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Stellar Blade can be played on PS5. Update 1.003 should be available to download now.</p>

In this article, I’d like to tell you a bit about our collaborative, community-driven approach to the development of our flagship franchise, Dying Light. I want to convey why this attitude is so important for us and why we think it’s the right way to go when it comes to our games. I’ll also spotlight the Community Ideas initiative, which is a perfect encapsulation of this strategy.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first Dying Light game was released back in 2015 as our second venture into the realm of open-world zombie IPs. We were very proud of its uniqueness—the core elements, such as the first-person perspective parkour, focus on melee weapons, and the day/night cycle that heavily influenced the gameplay, made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> really stand apart. The appreciation we got from the players back then and the community that started to form around the game gave us—the developers—a lot of confidence and let us spread our wings. Since then, we adopted the strategy of giving back to our players, we’re listening to their suggestions and feedback. We ended up supporting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for almost seven years after its release, building a massive community—the game currently has an overwhelmingly positive rating on Steam with 300,000 reviews, more appearing each day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we released the sequel in 2022, we knew from the very beginning that we wanted to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a good couple of years. We wanted the fans to have a say in how the world is shaped, to have their opinions taken into consideration when it comes to decisions regarding the direction of the brand itself and design decisions, both big and small.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We focused on the three main areas of cooperation with the community:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Social Media communication</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s start with the basics. Like every studio, we try to monitor the opinions of our players that they share online. Our Community Management Team reads and analyzes the feedback and investigates the player sentiment as well as the reception of updates and features that we regularly add to the game. Additionally, said team, together with our QA department, turns the players’ requests into tangible project tasks, recording them in Jira once a week, which are then properly groomed by producers and have their priorities assigned. This helps us work on the requests from our community on an ongoing basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community Council is a group of several dozen of the most dedicated, trusted players, community members and influencers with whom we meet once per quarter to talk about our plans for the evolution of the game and get their feedback. Those are the same people we invite to participate in the closed beta tests of the new in-game initiatives. Some of the features that benefited from this treatment—such as the addition of a physical parkour setting or the newly released Nightmare Difficulty—were broadly appreciated by the community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, however, I’d like to focus on what is, in our opinion, the most interesting endeavor we’ve attempted yet: the Community Ideas program. It’s a special means of getting feedback, where our players can submit requested features and elements they’d like to see added to our game. The ideas that are feasible to implement, based on the existing gameplay mechanics, can be found on the dedicated page of our community hub,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/goodies/community-ideas?state=1&amp;category=&amp;order=&amp;page=1&amp;limit=20&amp;query="> Pilgrim Outpost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Then, the players vote for their favorites to be included in the game. But don’t let this cursory outline fool you! The entire matter is quite complex, with a pretty extensive process that involves us checking each submitted idea.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The voting happens in stages and it’s important to note here that this timing is aligned with our release cycle, as we aim to update the game once every few months. Thanks to this scheduling, the ideas can be implemented fairly soon.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, several of the most popular ideas end up with the development team, where they’re further assessed. While evaluating them, we pay attention to their originality, feasibility, added value, whether a given feature would clash with other gameplay elements from a technical perspective, and so on. The ideas are divided into three categories:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The accepted ones land in our task lists, where we calculate what is needed to implement them and what’s the rough timeline for that. The rejected ideas are deemed unsuitable or ultimately too costly. It’s also worth mentioning that we not only notify the authors of the rejected ideas that we’re not moving forward with them, but we also try to give them the reason for the refusal whenever we can. It’s additional work, of course, but we don’t want to discourage our players by the lack of feedback from us. The third option is Backlog—it’s for the ideas that we like and want to take a closer look at, but their implementation is not immediately possible. It might come down to the insufficient amount of time and resources at a particular moment, or the fact that they would involve altering the game in a significant way—but we still like them and want them to happen at a later date. They’re benched for now.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We launched the second round of Community Ideas in mid-April, which means that the players can again submit their ideas and vote for the best ones. We received over 1500 new entries in a couple of days, so the interest has not waned. We also keep getting feedback concerning the process itself. At the community’s request, we implemented features such as a keyword search bar, extended categories filter, multiple language support, and entry translation powered by Google API. And we will keep upgrading the tool.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We consider this collaborative, community-driven approach to supporting our games to be a good strategy—as every developer cares about favorable reception as well as high community engagement. I think I can confidently claim that our method works. Since the introduction of the Community Ideas program, the player sentiment, expressed as positive comments and reviews, has risen. And </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—despite the fact that it’s an open-world AAA game—can still boast a sizable player base two years after it premiered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Undoubtedly, this type of approach comes with a multitude of challenges. The most substantial one is finding balance between applying the suggestions from the community and maintaining your own authorial vision of the game. The other obstacle is finding time and appropriate resources to be able to focus on implementing the community's ideas, yes, but first and foremost, on realizing our development plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical side alone—Pilgrim Outpost website maintenance, accumulating and cleaning up of the ideas themselves, not to mention managing the duplicates—is incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Regardless of whether you decide to launch a dedicated program, like our Community Ideas, or to follow a general strategy of community-driven development, you need to:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prepare a production pipeline that will be able to take on the incoming community requests;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make sure that you have appropriate resources at your disposal: people, time, money—all according to the model you’re working with;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interact with the players—launching such a program or a development strategy is a huge commitment on the part of the developer, so you need to be transparent in your actions and communicate the respective stages, decisions, etc.;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be consistent in your actions—nowadays, it’s extremely easy to lose the players’ trust and end up with a result that is entirely opposite to what you had in mind, so if you show your community that they are important, stick to it;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brace yourself for tough feedback.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This all may seem a bit daunting—and that’s a reasonable reaction. The entire process is a lot, but with good planning, cleverly allocated resources, and some flexibility, it’s entirely feasible. And the benefits are really worth it. On the one hand, you get a structured and regulated source of player feedback, and on the other, you give the community the means to influence the game’s development. Both sides benefit, and the game itself ends up getting better and better!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="176" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Hooded Horse and 3Division <a href="https://youtu.be/gswXkLcAFxA?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have announced</a> that the ridiculously intricate city builder, <em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em>, will be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-is-planning-to-exit-early-access-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving Early Access</a> on June 20, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">I’ve played a lot of city builders in my time, and <em>Workers &amp; Resources</em> is easily the most complicated. Not only do you need to build homes for your citizens and workplaces and industry to employ them, you also need to make sure that your supply and production chain is working as efficiently as possible.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="825" data-injectable="true">Supply chains are hardly anything new, but usually, there’s some abstract automation there. As long as you have your roads connected, normally, your products get where they need to go. For example, you might need to connect your factory to a cargo train. And then you need to ensure that the train is able to get where it needs to go without bumping into other trains. Then, on top of that, you need to connect its destination to the train so that whatever was produced gets to the next step in its journey.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">It takes a lot of trial and error to figure out how things work. A recent update added a “campaign,” which largely acts as an extended tutorial. Even with that, I kept making costly mistakes. This feels like the sort of game where it’s going to take a few attempts before you really understand enough to be successful.</p> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic - 1.0 Release Date Trailer | City Builder Tycoon Game" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gswXkLcAFxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">That said, the genre really needs something that really pushes the complexity. I love city builders that gloss over certain aspects in the effort to keep things accessible, but you need some place to go when you really want something to sink your teeth into.</p> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">The 1.0 release will include a number of upgrades to the current version. Here’s the bulleted list from the press release:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"> <li>New buildings to enrich the lives of citizens through entertainment and fitness, including the amphitheater, and a large stadium.</li> <li>Additional playgrounds for the younger generation to stay healthy.</li> <li>Brand new Western vehicles to expand the nation’s transit network.</li> <li>Revamped education system to maximize the potential reach of teachers.</li> <li>Graphical improvements to the electronics components factory, woodcutting post, sawmill, panels factory, and many more key buildings.</li> <li>Improved factory connection nodes to facilitate a better flow of resources across complex production chains.</li> <li>Plenty of other quality-of-life fixes and HUD tweaks.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Sounds awesome. I really need to take another crack at <em>Workers &amp; Resources</em>. I was starting to get all its systems organized in my head before something else got my attention. Something catastrophic, no doubt. The 1.0 release sounds like the absolute best time to try again.</p> <p data-characters="85" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false"><em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em> leaves Early Access for PC on June 20, 2024.</p>

 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Although this is the first ‘laundry list’ that has been released, <em>The Sims 4</em> hopes to issue a new laundry list roughly every two months, detailing the items they’re currently working on and aiming to fix. They do emphasise that not all of these things will be fixed before the next update, as some issues are more complex and require more time.</p> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">Here’s the full list of fixes the team is currently working on, according to the May 23 ‘laundry list’:</p>

 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Like I said, there’s no guarantee that all or any of these updates will be ready in time for the next update, but it’s nice to see that these issues are being worked on, especially those which have been an issue for a long time (I’m looking at you, trash cans!).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rabbit and Bear has released a new&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and it reveals the release months for the JRPG's three additional character-focused DLC chapters.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Eiyuden_JP/status/1793892378740469856" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account, Rabbit and Bear highlights the DLC that's already available, including the Pioneer Pack, the HQ Makeover Package, and the special Nowa Haniwa HQ statue.</p>

<p>More importantly, however, the roadmap reveals that&nbsp;the game's three extra DLC chapters, which will revolve around Marisa, Seign, and Markus respectively, will launch in successive months later this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap-proper.jpg?itok=Oe1VBmSn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap-proper.jpg?itok=N_pKeIEN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The roadmap is in Japanese, but the release months for each DLC pack are pretty clear: Marisa's chapter is slated for August, with Seign's landing in September and Markus' coming in October.</p>

<p>Since this is the Japanese roadmap, and it hasn't been released on any of the official English&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&nbsp;</em>social media channels, it's possible these are Japanese-only release windows.</p>

<p>However, given that the&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694110/Eiyuden_Chronicle_Hundred_Heroes__Season_Pass?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Season Pass page on Steam</a> lists a Q4 release date for all of these packs, the Western release dates aren't likely to be far behind, even if they are different.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the three additional DLC episodes will be free to Kickstarter backers, but if you didn't back the game and you still want to play them, you'll be able to buy each episode separately or all three as part of the Season Pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap-fire.jpg?itok=nzIuhB2I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap-fire.jpg?itok=0JdJ8rN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&nbsp;</em>story episodes are on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</em>, it's the spiritual successor to the cult classic&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series of JRPGs.</p>

<p>Created by many of the folks behind the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series, including director Yoshitaka Murayama (who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-and-eiyuden-chronicle-creator-yoshitaka-murayama-has-passed-away">sadly passed away earlier this year</a>), the RPG boasts many similar features to its inspiration, including a host of heroes to recruit, minigames to play, and more.</p>
