            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Blizzard Entertainment began emailing its users one-month PC Game Pass trial codes (only usable on new accounts). I got one myself, and there are many other reports <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1e5920i/blizzard_has_started_sending_out_pc_game_pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on places like Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the offer is that it is set to expire on July 24. You have a week to redeem your code. Why July 24, though? Well, recent rumors have suggested a new wave of Activision Blizzard games might be about to be added to the subscription service.</p>
<p>Chief among them is, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</a>. Call of Duty fans have been looking forward to the massive first-person shooter franchise being added to Game Pass, and the new Modern Warfare III season drops on July 24. Microsoft might be trying to get more new users in ahead of the game's arrival on the subscription service.</p>
<p>In addition to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> rumors that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro: Reignited Trilogy, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 will soon join Game Pass. However, these are all Activision titles and the promotion email came specifically from Blizzard. As such, it's not far-fetched to imagine some Blizzard games might be part of this new wave following <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV's example</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Remasters like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-ii-resurrected-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo II: Resurrected</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warcraft-iii-reforged-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warcraft III: Reforged</a> come to mind, as well as classics like Starcraft and Diablo III, not to mention perks for Overwatch 2. Then there's the long-standing dream of World of Warcraft joining Game Pass, although that's hard to imagine coming to fruition, given that the monthly subscription price of Blizzard's MMORPG is higher than PC Game Pass ($14.99 versus $11.99). Perhaps they could offer a discount.</p>
<p>Adding a good chunk of the extraordinary Activision Blizzard portfolio would surely go a long way toward convincing consumers that Game Pass is still convenient even after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> latest price increase.</a> As a reminder, the Ultimate tier will cost $19.99, up from $16.99; the PC tier will be raised to $11.99 from $9.99, and the console tier will be unavailable to new users, replaced by a more limited Standard tier priced at $14.99.</p>
<p>According to analysts, Game Pass users should anticipate <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-users-should-expect-more-price-bumps-in-the-future-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more hikes in the future</a>.</p>

It's a major upgrade over the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-s-review">Xbox Series S</a>, which is only capable of 1440p output on select titles. </p><p>Now's as good a chance as any to pick up a new Xbox with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amazon-prime-day-sales-and-deals">Amazon Prime Day</a> running through Wednesday night and other retailers with their own competing sales. As part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-sale-prime-day-2024">Best Buy's Black Friday in July sale</a>, you can save $50 off a new Xbox Series X console. Not only that, but you will also get a free $50 Best Buy gift card with your purchase, which you can use to score a new game or controller. </p><h2>Xbox Series X + $50 Best Buy Gift Card for $449</h2><div id="204354" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>FREE $50 BEST BUY GIFT CARD WITH PURCHASE</p></div><p><h3>Microsoft - Xbox Series X 1TB Console - Black</h3></p></div>Immediately upon purchase, the gift card will be emailed to you alongside your receipt. Since Best Buy's sale is open to everyone, you won't need to be a My Best Buy member to score this gift card. <p>The Xbox Series X is a great console overall for any game you'd like to play. With Game Pass Ultimate – grab a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-43-off-for-prime-day-stock-up-now-and-avoid-the-price-hike">three-month subscription for 43% off for Prime Day</a> – you can even stream games over the cloud and pick up where you left off, even if you're not home.</p><h2>What We Said In Our Review</h2><p>Xbox Series X is an excellent console that offers the most power available in the console space currently. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-review">In our review</a>, we said the following about the Series X: "No matter what current games you throw at it, your loading times will be drastically cut, your framerates will be smoother, and your resolutions will be higher. This bold and minimalistically designed box is quiet, compact for both the power it packs and especially how it compares to the PS5, capable, and loaded with convenience features like instantly resuming and cycling between any of your recently played games."
</p><h3>Is It Worth Buying At This Price?</h3><p>If you are currently a Game Pass subscriber or plan to subscribe to the service, Xbox Series X is a great choice. You'll get hundreds of games instantly to play through, with the best performance available in the Xbox ecosystem. Plus, with the 4K Disc drive, you can play any <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-part-two-deal-prime-day-2024">4K Blu-rays</a> with ease.</p><p>However, if you're in no rush to purchase a new console, you'll likely find far better deals later in the year for Black Friday, especially as Xbox plans to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">three new console variants</a>. It's likely that the current Xbox Series X will be discounted alongside these releases to push more Xbox consoles into the market.</p><p>For more Xbox deals, be sure to check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-prime-day-2024">best Xbox deals of Prime Day 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2024 1:39 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Selected as the first game in the collaboration campaign by North American crowdfunding site <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gameround/chrono-sword-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and the global game testing platform Game Round.Inc in 2020, it raised over seventy thousand dollars to successfully reach its funding goal.</p><p>Developer 21c.Ducks has submitted <em>Chrono Sword</em> to a number of game shows in Korea and abroad, where it was praised and awarded by a number of these for its gameplay. The developer then used this as a chance to refine the gameplay and level design within the game.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_899380"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> isn’t another 3D rendered game like many of the Souls-like <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,243 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> released these days, instead rendered in an isometric pixel art style for this unique Souls-like. Since 21c.Ducks announced the game, they’ve shown a heart and soul commitment to elevating the game’s storyline and the features that make it a Soulslike action RPG.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Chrono Sword</em> spans a vast land splayed out in three dimensions, all rendered in its pixel art style. Once inside, players will embark on a “journey through time,” able to venture between the past, present, and future, switching between maps seamlessly with no loading screens.</p><p>In addition, the game features a variety of systems that incorporate the heavy enemy and player hits common to the Souls-like genre, but with the action made faster and more intense. Details of the enhancements made to <em>Chrono Sword</em> will be revealed at a later date.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Today, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1813287523780641094" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a brand new</a> dynamic background for download, and it's based on the iconic "Blades" format first introduced with the Xbox 360.</p><p>The interface shows the green and grey colors that made this design so memorable back in 2005. However, it's only a dynamic background and you can't actually flip through anything. In order to change your background, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the Xbox button in the middle of the controller to bring up the menu</li><li>Scroll over to Profile &amp; System and click Settings. Under the General tab, click on Personalization, then go to My Background then to Dynamic Backgrounds.</li><li>Under the Featured Tab, choose Xbox 360 Blades</li></ul><p>This move seems like a final acknowledgement of the Xbox 360 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-360-store-is-closing-but-dont-get-too-worried/1100-6516956/" data-ref-id="1100-6516956">before its storefront closes down for good on July 29</a>. While you'll still be able to buy and download Xbox 360 content that's backwards compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S through their respective digital storefronts, anything that can only be found through the Xbox 360 Marketplace will be gone after that date.</p><p>The Xbox 360 era is arguably Microsoft's most notable, as the Xbox brand really came into prominence when the console was first released in 2005. It's so iconic, in fact, that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-build-an-xbox-360-out-of-1342-mega-bloks/1100-6517575/" data-ref-id="1100-6517575">there's a $150 buildable replica of the Xbox 360 from Mega</a>.</p>

When our aspirations get bigger than our morality, humankind creates a machine that decides humans should no longer exist. How do we battle this? By going back in time to make sure it never happens at all. </p><p id="terminator-6-film-collection-blu-ra"><h2 data-toc-title="Terminator 6-Film Collection [Blu-ra">44% off Terminator 6-Film Collection [Blu-Ray]</h2></p><div catalogid="856498fb-89eb-4cea-be3e-879f23594e26" id="203405"><div id="203405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Terminator 6-Film Collection [Blu-ray]</h3></p></div><p>Terminator has been a staple in the Sci-Fi genre since its explosion on the big screen in 1984 as a Sci-Fi horror, all the way through to its most recent additions. Though there are only 6 feature-length Terminator films, there was also the hit TV series <em>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>, and a brand new Netflix anime series coming out this year to catch up on. Check out our reviews of the 6 films below:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-terminator"><em>The Terminator Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-2-judgment-day"><em>Terminator 2: Judgement Day Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-3-rise-of-the-machines"><em>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-salvation"><em>Terminator Salvation Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-genesys"><em>Terminator Genisys Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-6"><em>Terminator: Dark Fate Review</em></a><em></em></li></ul><h2>Where to Stream Online</h2><p>Below you will find links to stream almost all 6 Terminator movies online. For the moment, 5 of the Terminator movies are available to stream on various platforms online. Some of those streaming platforms are fuboTV, Peacock TV, Prime Video, Paramount+, Max, MGM+, Roku, Tubi, and TBS. 5 of the Terminator movies (<strong>excluding Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</strong>) are also available to rent or buy on Amazon or YouTube. </p><h3>Best Order to Watch in</h3><p>Since there is an element of time travel included in the canon of the Terminator movie series, the events can become a bit muddled; that's why watching them in order of release date is probably fine to do with this series.

Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service could soon expand to include access to Switch versions of the company's games if a now-reverted recent update to its website is anything to go by.

<p>
A full list of games available to GTA+ members can be found on the Rockstar's website, with subscribers currently able to access titles across a range of platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, the iOS App Store, and Google Play.

<p>
However, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1812959219680768485">TezFunz2 on X</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rockstars-gta-subscription-service-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">VGC</a>) a recent update to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-plus/benefits">Rockstar's website</a> added Switch versions to the list of Games Included With GTA+, prompting speculation the company might soon make it possible for GTA+ subscribers to play titles on Nintendo's platform as part of their membership.
</p>
<p>
While Switch's library of Rockstar games is limited, LA Noire, Gand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, and Red Dead Redemption have all been ported to the console, making for a reasonable chunk of on-the-go action Rockstar could wield as additional incentive to tempt players toward GTA+.
</p>
<p>
Time will tell if Switch's recent inclusion on Rockstar's GTA+ Benefits page is a sign of things to come or merely meaningless placeholder art inadvertently let loose upon the world, but I've asked the company for comment, just in case it has something to say.
</p>
<p>
Beyond potential new GTA+ offerings, Rockstar has its hands full elsewhere. The studio and publisher Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">recently confirmed</a> the long-awaited <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is launching in autumn next year.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The rocket-assisted sidearm archetype, a pistol that literally shoots rockets, is one of the best gun types in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, and with the launch of Act 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-the-final-shape-episode-echo-season-pass-gear-and-exotics/2900-5451/" data-ref-id="2900-5451">Episode: Echoes</a>, we're now up to three of these powerful, explosive-launching pistols in the game. While you'll still want to get a crafted god roll of The Call from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>'s new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler, the newly released Aberrant Action is another gun you should be chasing. It too is craftable, and since it's a Solar gun, it carries some extremely useful perks that will help you in high-level PVE content.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How To Get Aberrant Action</h2><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action is part of the Episode loot pool, so you'll need to complete Episode activities to earn it. That means heading into Breach Executable, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-enigma-protocol-guide-how-to-unlock-and-complete-the-episode-activity/1100-6524267/" data-ref-id="1100-6524267">Enigma Protocol</a>, or the newly released Nessus Battlegrounds missions in hopes of receiving Aberrant Action as a random reward. It seems more likely that you'll get them from the Battlegrounds playlist, probably because it and Aberrant Action are releasing together.</p><p dir="ltr">You're guaranteed at least one Aberrant Action for completing the story quests of the first week of Act 2, as well as Corrasion, the episode's new pulse rifle. You can also get Aberrant Action from Failsafe in the HELM when you turn in Echoes engrams, and eventually, you'll be able to focus those engrams to get Aberrant Action specifically--although, you can't unlock that ability in the first week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335557"></a><figcaption>Aberrant Action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Heal Clip  <ul><li dir="ltr">Reloading shortly after a final blow grants Cure to you and nearby allies.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Incandescent  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a target spreads scorch to nearby enemies. More powerful combatants and Guardians spread scorch in a larger radius.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action is a bit of a weaker option when compared to The Call and Indebted Kindness, the rocket-assisted sidearm you can get from the Spire of the Watcher dungeon. It might not wallop enemies quite as well as those other guns, but it makes up for that weakness with Solar build synergy.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a utility player that'll slot right in with your Solar builds thanks to the combination of Heal Clip and Incandescent, which work extremely well with Solar abilities, especially those reliant on scorch. Incandescent sets nearby enemies on fire when you get a kill, and Heal Clip heals you and nearby allies when you reload after a kill. In concert with other build elements that burn enemies and heal you, Aberrant Action is a great fit.</p><p dir="ltr">There are actually a few other good combinations for Aberrant Action, as well, if you find you want a version that's a little less dependent on a Solar use-case. Beacon Rounds, a new perk from The Final Shape, feels great, giving your sidearm rockets tracking once you get a kill with them. It's a great perk for dealing with enemies on the far side of an arena and can make up for the slower speed of rockets when compared to bullets from traditional guns.</p><p dir="ltr">Demolitionist is also pretty good, since you'll use your rocket-assisted sidearm to blow up and clear out lots of smaller enemies, which will boost your grenade up-time overall, and Reverberation boosts the size of your rocket explosions, which can help increase the overall utility of Aberrant Action for clearing weak enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Heal Clip / Beacon Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Heal Clip: Reloading shortly after a final blow grants Cure to you and nearby allies.</li><li dir="ltr">Beacon Rounds: Final blows with this weapon grant your projectiles tracking. Dealing further damage extends the duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Harmony / Golden Tricorn  <ul><li dir="ltr">Harmony: Final blows with other weapons improve this weapon's damage and performance for a short duration.</li><li dir="ltr">Golden Tricorn: Final blows with this weapon grant bonus damage. While this buff is active, grenade or melee kills of the same damage type greatly increase its damage and duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action isn't much of a PvP gun, so unless you love it, don't lean into that aspect of it. There are better rocket-assisted sidearms for the job, and generally, they're not well-suited to taking down Guardians anyway. If you do go with Aberrant Action in the Crucible, put your emphasis on boosting damage and the gun's Velocity stat, as it'll make those rockets harder to dodge.</p><p dir="ltr">For perks, your combo will depend on how you play in the Crucible. Heal Clip can help you get through dangerous situations with a boost of health after you use the gun to land a kill, making it a handy clean-up weapon in dual scenarios. Beacon Rounds, on the other hand, can pair well with Harmony, where you're going after more opponents after racking up a kill with another weapon, giving you a damage boost and, potentially, tracking on your rockets. More aggressive players will likely want the Beacon Rounds / Harmony combo, but really, there's not much in the way of perk synergy that will help you withstand fights with multiple enemies here.</p>

        <p>As 360 digital store closures looms.</p>

            <p>
With the closure of Microsoft's Xbox 360 digital store looming, the company has announced a final batch of heavy discounts on earlier-gen titles, as well as the release of a new Xbox Series X/S dynamic background, inspired by the Xbox 360's much-loved "blades" dashboard design.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">announced the impending closure of its Xbox 360 digital store</a> last August, revealing it would no longer be possible to purchase games, DLC, or other entertainment content via the Xbox 360 console or web-based Xbox 360 Marketplace from 29th July this year.
</p>
<p>
It did, however, confirm previously purchased Xbox 360 games and DLC would remain downloadable and playable - including via backward compatibility on modern consoles - even after the store's closure. And since then, it's been working with third-party publisher to offer heavy price reductions on its digital Xbox 360 catalogue.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
To that end, today brings a third and final batch of Xbox 360 Marketplace discounts ahead of its closure later this month, and a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-360-price-reductions-available-now/">full list of reduced games</a> can be found on Microsoft's website.
</p>
<p>
And if that's not enough nostalgia for you, Microsoft has also released the aforementioned Xbox 360-inspired dynamic background for Xbox Series X/S, enabling users of a certain age to stare misty eyed into the middle distance as they fondly recall a time those now-stationary Blades could be manipulated with affectionate gusto.

To grab the new background, hit the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide, then navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalisation &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds. There, you'll find the Xbox 360 Blades design either under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds, and you can download it by hitting the A button.
</p>
<p>
And finally, if you're eager to advertise your old-school predilections to the world, Microsoft has <a href="https://gear.xbox.com/collections/the-heritage-collection">re-released the Xbox 360 Heritage Collection</a> - featuring a selection of 360-inspired t-shirts and pullover hoodie - on its Gear Shop for a limited time.

		<p>Dead by Daylight’s 2v8 multiplayer mode will be coming next week as a time limited event. 2v8 will be available from 25th July until 8th August.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | 2v8 Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2v8 does exactly what it says on the tin, doubling the player count in the game with two killers teaming up to hunt down eight survivors.</p>
<p>The long-awaited game mode won’t stick around for very long, but Behaviour has put plenty of work into trying to rebalance the game around the increased player count. There’s a new super-sized map, as well as gameplay adjustments to rebalance the action. This means there’s&nbsp;a class-like system instead of Perks and Cages instead of Hooks.</p>
<p>In other Dead by Daylight news, cross-progression is coming to the game on 22nd July! Progression, inventory, paid currency and DLC can all be shared between all platforms, with the sole exception of Nintendo Switch not sharing currency or DLC. <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/28143341034644-Cross-Progression-Release-FAQ">Head here for Behaviour’s FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>We have have Lara Croft of the Tomb Raider franchise entering The Fog as the latest game franchise crossover and guest Survivor.</p>

And it seems players agree that these aren’t great versions of these games, as data shows that these ports are likely flopping hard on iOS. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported on July 16 by <em>MobileGamer.biz</em></a></span>, data seems to indicate that<em> RE7'</em>s iOS port, which launched on July 2, has only made Capcom around $28,000 via 2,000 people paying for the full game after downloading the free demo. </p><p>Other AAA iPhone ports have also failed to find much success on the App Store. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/those-assassins-creed-resident-evil-and-death-stranding-ports-have-bombed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/those-assassins-creed-resident-evil-and-death-stranding-ports-have-bombed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As previously reported by the outlet in June</a></span>, data indicates that after a month only 3,000 people had purchased <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>, even though its free trial version had been downloaded over 120,000 times. </p><p>2023's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake</a></span> did a <em>bit </em>better after six months on the market. It was downloaded 357,000 times with data indicating that around 7,000 people paid the $30 to unlock the full game. <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, on the other hand, did horribly on iOS. In about the same amount of time, only around 5,700 people paid $15 to play <em>Village </em>on their iPhone or iPad. </p><h2 id="h211729"><a id=""></a>Why AAA games are flopping on iPhone</h2><p>So what’s happening here? Well, I think the higher price points for these AAA ports are scaring away a lot of mobile players who are used to free games. But I think the bigger issue is that these aren’t the kind of games people want to play on their phones in 2024. I love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a></span>. It’s a wonderful return to the stealth-focused gameplay and smaller worlds of older <em>AC</em> games, while still feeling modern and fun to play. Good shit! But I have zero desire to play that game on a tiny iPhone with a cumbersome controller attached or via terrible touchscreen buttons. </p><p>These AAA games were designed to be played for hours and hours, often in a comfy chair or couch, with a controller or keyboard and a big screen. And that’s just not the experience you get with a phone. The best mobile games are pick-up-and-play. Things you can open up, have a bit of fun with, and then drop a few seconds later because your bus arrived or your game finished installing on Xbox. </p><p> iPhones will for sure get more powerful and be able to run even more AAA games at high framerates and resolutions in the future. That’s a fact. But I’m not sold on any of these games finding success on the App Store because they just aren’t what most people want to play on their mobile devices. </p><p>So now the question is, with Capcom and other publishers not making money on these ports, how long before Apple stops (probably, this hasn’t been confirmed) funding them and all these AAA games stop arriving on iOS? How long before Apple tosses in the towel on gaming once more? We shall see...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> single player horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-casting-of-frank-stone">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> will launch on 3rd September, Behaviour Interactive and developer Supermassive Games have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Murder Mill Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6FODK6lwtM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from the makers of The Dark Pictures Anthology series, The Casting of Frank Stone is an intriguing collaboration with one of the most popular and enduring multiplayer horror games out there.</p>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone steps back to the summer of 1980, with four friends intent on making an iconic example of horror cinema. Instead they set loose a dormant horror into the real world. Your choices while playing this branching narrative will change how their relationships develop, and ultimately their fates while recording their shoot of Murder Mill.</p>
<p>As expected from Supermassive, the game will weave together this branching narrative with environmental puzzles, hunting for clues and Quick Time Events.</p>

<p>Coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, there will be two versions of the game: the standard edition at $39.99, and the deluxe edition at $49.99. This grants instant access to the Cutting Room Floor feature that lets you backtrack to key story points, and eight alternate costumes.</p>
<p>Pre-ordering either version will also unlock rewards in Dead by Daylight:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Frank Stone Mask” cosmetic for The Trapper (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>“Frank Stone” badge and banner (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>Three Rellik doll charms (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>“Murder Mill” shirt cosmetic for all Original Survivors</li>
<li>“Murder Mill” badge and banner</li>
<li>Two million Bloodpoints</li>
</ul>

Right now, you can scoop up a number of excellent first-party Nintendo Switch games for $39.99 each. Most of them are available in both physical and digital formats at that price.
