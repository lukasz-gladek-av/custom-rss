It’s a public service announcement that let’s players know that there's a small issue with update 1.6, and a fix is on the way.

            <p>
New York Times tech staff have begun strike action in protest of alleged unfair labour practices, and are asking people not to play the Times' games - which include the likes of Wordle and Connections - in order to "honour the digital picket line".
</p>
<p>
The strike, which started today after "multiple rounds of intense bargaining" with management failed to reach an agreement, has been organised by The Times Tech Guild, a union covering 600 workers responsible for the creation and maintainance of the technology powering the New York Times' website and games.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://x.com/nyguild/status/1853418971585729013">statement</a> shared by the NewsGuild of New York - the labour union representing over 6,000 workers at news organisation in the area - the Times Tech Guild had raised a number of key concerns with management prior to today's strike. These include remote/hybrid work protections, "just cause" job protections (which the Times' newsroom is said to have had for "decades"), subcontracting limits, and pay equity/fair pay.

<p>
Times management are accused of engaging in "numerous labour law violations" during the bargaining process, including the implementation of a return-to-office mandate without bargaining, and the intimidation of staff through "interrogations about their strike intentions".
</p>
<p>
As a result, the NewsGuild of New York has filed unfair labour practice charges against the Times covering "numerous" violations of labour law, and work stoppage began at 12.01am ET on Monday with Tech Guild members picketing outside its Eighth Avenue entrance. Additionally, its newsroom union has pledged not to do struck work, as per their contract.
</p><p>
The Times Tech Guild's strike action is set to continue daily from 9am to 6pm if no progress is made during negotiations - threatening to impact the Times' US election coverage this week - and the union is asking readers to "honour the digital picket line and not play popular NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections as well as not use the NYT Cooking app."
</p>
<p>
"Our union members and bargaining committee have done everything to avoid this ULP strike," Tech Guild unit chair Kathy Zhang said in the statement. "But management is more willing to risk our election coverage than they are to agree to a fair deal with its workers. They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labour on the picket line. Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract across the line."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/474209/new-york-times-strike-wordle-connections">response provided to Polygon</a>, New York Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said, "We look forward to continuing to work with the Tech Guild to reach a fair contract that takes into account that they are already among the highest paid individual contributors in the Company and journalism is our top priority.
</p>
<p>
"We're in one of the most consequential periods of coverage for our readers and have robust plans in place to ensure that we are able to fulfil our mission and serve our readers. While we respect the union's right to engage in protected actions, we're disappointed that colleagues would strike at this time, which is both unnecessary and at odds with our mission."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/czech-release-of-mass-effect-board-game-will-remove-squadmate-pronouns<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Czech Republic version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em> board game</a> will be changed. A representative of Asmodee has stated that the licensed board game will be released in the region with squadmates' pronouns removed, possibly as a capitulation to bad-faith culture war advocates.</p>



<p>The changes to the Czech Republic Mass Effect board game were revealed on the website <a href="https://www.zatrolene-hry.cz/spolecenska-hra/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-16040/diskuse/kritika-40147/?pg=2">Zatrolene-hry</a>. In the comments section, Asmodee Czech Republic's Brand Manager, Michal, stated the following:</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-announcement-post.jpg?itok=6xRggQAD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-announcement-post.jpg?itok=EcJ_OZTp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The subject in question regards the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game including personal pronouns for each playable squad member in the top corner of their character sheets.</p>

<p>At first this decision appears to be purely linguistic. The Czech language isn't the same as English as it uses grammatical gender with its nouns; and that's before local colloquialisms and cultural affectations are taken into account.</p>

<p>But the section in parentheses, saying they will argue with the publisher that they don't want pronouns put into the game, frames the act as confrontational.</p>

<p>It is a position strongly associated with a rise of entitled fandom-grifting culture war advocates. Ones that have been pushing back against the inclusion of gender expression terms in any creative work, claiming it is pushing back against a "woke agenda."</p>

<p>In fact, these advocates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">review-bombed</a> the game and harrassed the lead designer, Eric Lang, into deleting several social media posts.</p>

<p>Another user on the site asked Michal why Asmodee CZ is making this change. Was it being done to mollify a certain audience? A declaration of censorship or alteration to the original designers' vision?</p>

<p>Michal's answer wasn't exactly mindful. He stated that just as thousands of works have released in most recent years without pronouns,<em> Mass Effect</em> will be no different. Furthermore, their removal would have zero issues since "Liara is a female looking character, why would there be anything written under her?"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-response_0.jpg?itok=78Vo3kUx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-response_0.jpg?itok=JTQZOr84 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This example is dubious at best since in the world of <em>Mass Effect</em>, Liara comes from a monogendered alien race which, while feminine presenting, have diverse gender expression supported by the lore; hence her (She/They) pronouns in the board game.</p>

<p>Additional commenters spoke out on Michal's reasoning, citing the culture war harassment mentioned above alongside ongoing progressive trends. In response, Michal stated the decision to remove pronouns from the game happened before these issues came to light, saying the decision was practical and not political.</p>

<p>However, Michal's statements are undercut by additional posts and responses seen as aggressive. Responses that were deleted by the site's moderators.</p>

<p>While crude and full of discourse, it seems Asmodee CZ has made a notable decision on altering their release of the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game. A change that has, regardless of reason, has been altered from the creator's original vision.</p>

Is the Joker Arthur? Is the Joker another personality (his shadow)? Who exactly is Arthur?

Or was it Arthur? This question is constantly raised to Lee and even to the people of Gotham City within the film. We live in an age of mass production of ‘poetic justice’ heroes, a battle between good and evil. Lately, many spin-off films with a focus on the villains have been made. Can villains be superheroes too? Is this question posed on the big screen as a DC movie, too avant-garde? Was it the Joker that audiences around the world loved? Was it Arthur? This is where the reviews have diverged.”</p><p>Kojima suggests that over the next “10 or 20 years” the <em>Joker 2</em>'s “reputation” will change as well as future superhero flicks. </p><p>“It may take some time for it to become a true ‘folie à deux.’ But there is no doubt that everyone in the audience loved Joaquin and Gaga in this film,” concluded Kojima. Will someone check back in on this post in 10 years and ping me to see if people love <em>Joker 2</em> by then? Cool, thanks! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whenever you’re excited about an upcoming game, especially one as unique and eclectic as Slitterhead, you want to check out the game’s system requirements beforehand. It’s wise to prepare, though you’re unlikely to upgrade your system for a single game. But hey, you can temper your expectations. Here’s a look at the Slitterhead system requirements before launch!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-run-slitterhead-s-system-requirements-successfully">Can You Run Slitterhead’s System Requirements Successfully?</h2>



<p>While most of Slitterhead’s PC system requirements don’t appear overly challenging for most gaming computers nowadays, the processor on the recommended requirements side of the spectrum may throw a wrench in the works for many players. Do you think your system can handle the upcoming horror game?</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-8700K / AMD Ryzen 5 2600X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-slitterhead">When Can You Play Slitterhead?</h2>



<p>If you’re eager to get your hands on the latest horror game from one of the minds behind the original Silent Hill, then you’re in luck because Slitterhead is nearly out in the world. The horror game officially launches on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on <strong>November 8</strong>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> players will receive several in-game items as "compensation" for September's troubled launched, which developer KT Racing has acknowledged was marred by "technical and server difficulties" resulting in customer "dissatisfaction".
</p>
<p>
Anyone that played Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown prior to its first major patch on 30th September will automatically receive two unique items in their inventories, both coinciding with Season 2's launch sometime after 18th December.
</p>
<p>
The first of these is a custom-built Adventurer edition of the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe, "fully equipped for the island's off-road roads". Eligible players will also receive a pack of five stickers that can be used to customise their cars.

<p>
Before their arrival, however, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is set to receive a second major patch, currently scheduled to launch on 5th November. This primarily features graphical enhancements for PS5, but there's also talk of optimisations for Xbox Series X/S and PC, alongside network upgrades, improved peripheral compatibility, and numerous bug fixes - as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1249970/announcements/detail/4505380324428942358">detailed on Steam</a>, where the game is still rated Mostly Negative.

<p>
Eurogamer contributor Mike Channell detailed Solar Crown's technical woes when he reviewed it in September, finding them severe enough that the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review-tech-issues-mar-the-return-of-the-original-name-in-open-world-racers">received two stars out of five</a>. "Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown's only hope is that it can keep its technical niggles at bay," Mike wrote, "and that its novel, lovingly crafted recreation of Hong Kong Island is enough to claw its way to cult favourite status among genre fans and digital tourists."

<p>In our Harold Halibut review, Dom said, <em>“Harold Halibut looks great, like one of Aardman’s finest, only as a video game. Unfortunately, it’s the game part that underwhelms, offering a distinctly tedious narrative adventure that is a chore to play.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios announced that the first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream will air tomorrow at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET <a href="http://twitch.tv/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> from Kuttenberg, one of the two main cities featured in the game. During the stream, the developers will hold a special live Q&amp;A session, during which they will reveal more information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the studio has announced a four-part live-action video series starring Tom McKay and Luke Dale, who play Henry of Skalitz (the main character) and his noble friend Hans Capon. The debut episode set in Kutná Hora will go live on Thursday, November 7, at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET on the developer's <a href="http://youtube.com/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is now set to launch on February 11, 2025. When the game was first unveiled earlier this year, the goal was to release it before the end of 2024. However, a short delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. That's where we had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima, who was all too happy to dive into the game's features for our readers.</p>
<p>By the way, Warhorse also announced today a major milestone for the first installment. It was only this February that Kingdom Come Deliverance <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-passes-6-million-sales-on-its-6th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> six million units sold on its sixth anniversary; nine months later, it has surpassed 8 million units. It's likely due to major discounts ahead of the sequel, but it's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the developers published a blog post <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/4514388158400430393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> where Senior Game Designer Ondřej Bittner talked about the inner workings of survival in the game.</p>
<p><em>The game has survival elements to it because you have to eat and you have to sleep. But that’s for the immersion. It's not hard to be rested and well fed and so on. The food spoils over time, so if you’re going somewhere far away it’s good to have dried fruit or dried meat jerky because it lasts longer. You can be vulnerable when you’re asleep. You can be robbed, or you can be attacked, depending on the circumstances. We even have it in the executioner’s historical records that someone might rob a house, get drunk, and then pass out on the bed - the perfect crime…</em></p>
<p><em>But generally, if you’re found somewhere you’re not supposed to be, you’ll be woken up. Or if someone’s looking for you because you did something wrong and they find you asleep, they’ll wake you up. You’ll need to pay your fine, or you’ll be arrested, whipped, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Overall, the design philosophy is said to differ from the average game. Rather than asking players to focus on tasks, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will encourage players to pay attention to their surroundings.</p>

While I’m sure there are plenty of games that folks already have their eyes on, there’s always a bunch of smaller games that inevitably fly under the radar. I’m here to correct that for you. </p><p>To that end, Xbox is currently hosting a sale on titles published through the ID@Xbox brand, which benefits independent developers and publishers trying to get their own games out there. One such publisher is Annapurna Interactive, which accidentally wound up taking up most of this list. Whoops! Anyways, here’s just a few of the best games available on that sale, <strong>which concludes on November 14. </strong><br></p></div></div><div><p>The last few years have brought with them a veritable bounty of wonderful puzzle games, and few of them are as good as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cocoon-review-puzzle-steam-switch-limbo-inside-1850883069&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cocoon-review-puzzle-steam-switch-limbo-inside-1850883069"><em>Cocoon</em></a></span>. An entirely wordless game, <em>Cocoon</em>—developed by a team that previously worked on games such as <em>Inside</em>—follows a bug-like protagonist’s odyssey through several different worlds within worlds, divining how to interact with distinctly alien structures and technologies to commune with while perhaps overthrowing some hostile force. <em><strong>Cocoon </strong></em><strong>is currently $12.49 and is well worth that price of admission. </strong><br></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170"><em>Ashen</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of the best indie attempts at a <em>Souls </em>game. It is restrained and quiet. It is elegant and magical. It is all these things and simultaneously thoughtful and somber. But more than any of that, it is about home. It accomplishes so much while remaining a visual feast with striking minimalist graphics art direction. <strong>You can play the game solo or cooperatively, and I really do encourage you to grab a partner and dive into </strong><em><strong>Ashen</strong></em><strong>, which will run you about $10 right now.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>The best people in your life believe that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654"><em>Outer Wilds</em></a></span><em> </em>is the best game of 2019. How can they be wrong? This space-faring adventure posits a simple but intriguing mystery: What waits for us at the center of the universe? The game fully delivers on that promise (and then some), but the best part of the game is the journey it’ll take you on. The solar system of <em>Outer Wilds </em>is teeming with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-haunting-discoveries-of-outer-wilds-1837299985&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-haunting-discoveries-of-outer-wilds-1837299985">mysteries</a></span> and as you bounce from planet to planet in search of answers, you’ll learn of what a rich tapestry you belong to—even as the whole system implodes in a supernova every 22 minutes. It is simply one of the most heartfelt stories I’ve ever experienced, wrapped up in one of the most astounding puzzle games I’ve ever played too. <strong>I’d hate to give too much away about <em>Outer Wilds</em>, so instead you should just pick it up while it’s discounted to $15 and thank me later.</strong></p></div><div><p>A lot of the reason for my love of <em>Thirsty Suitors </em>is that, as the title suggests, I too was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/thirsty-suitors/ive-got-a-huge-crush-on-jala-from-thirsty-suitors&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/thirsty-suitors/ive-got-a-huge-crush-on-jala-from-thirsty-suitors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">down bad for the main character</a></span>, Jala, the brown (specifically South Asian) alternative skater girl of my dreams. She is hilarious, hot, and most importantly, a colossal failure just like me. She too struggles with her place in two different worlds, that of her family and their cultural upbringing and the drastically different world that she was raised in outside of her home. She’s one of the most relatable protagonists I’ve encountered. And the way that she does psychic turn-based battles against her exes and overbearing family is aspirational. <strong>If you’re looking for a short RPG with a lot of fun banter, generational trauma, and some of the best style around, it’s hard to go wrong with <em>Thirsty Suitor</em>, which is available for $18 right now. </strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-remains-of-edith-finch-the-kotaku-review-1794562388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-remains-of-edith-finch-the-kotaku-review-1794562388"><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em></a></span><em> </em>is, effectively, a short story anthology in video game form. As the titular character, you return to the immense home of the Finch family, who has supposedly been cursed, and explore what remains of them around the house. Along the way, Edith literally trips and falls headfirst into the distinctly styled tragedies of her family members, which are all rendered as unique vignettes with their own mechanics. It’s a game so good you’ll tear through it in a single evening, but the night that you spend with <em>What Remains of Edith Finch </em>will stick with you for years after you’re done with it. <strong>You can have your own fateful night with </strong><em><strong>What Remains of Edith Finch </strong></em><strong>by picking it up for $5 while it’s on sale. </strong></p></div><div><p>Demagog Studio is a small team making narrative games about the collapse of the world as we know it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golf-club-wasteland-is-a-post-apocalyptic-golf-platform-1847058499&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golf-club-wasteland-is-a-post-apocalyptic-golf-platform-1847058499"><em>Golf Club Nostalgia</em></a></span>, despite the name, is exactly one of those titles and is in fact the team’s first effort. In it, you play golf among the remains of the world following an ecological collapse. In the time since, Earth has been abandoned by the rich, who’ve fled to Mars, and you only come back to Earth to play one final game of golf and discover what the hell happened.The premise sounds pretty far-fetched, but the more that our way of life is eroded by greed, the more realistic a vision of our future it appears to be. <strong>You can bear witness to the existential horror of <em>Golf Club Nostalgia</em> for yourself for just $2. </strong></p></div><div><p>Here’s the greatest endorsement I can give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a></span>, a rhythm action game from 2019: I do not skip any of the tracks that emerge on my shuffle all these years later. At times, I even live with a song or two as if I’m listening to them for the first time, enthralled by the propulsive set pieces of the game they’re wrapped in. “Parallel Universes” is just one of my favorite songs in any game ever, but it’s surrounded by bangers like “Begin Again” and “Night Drift.” I can’t even begin to write about what “A Place I Don’t Know” means to me without welling up.<br></p><p><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts </em>is like an interactive pop album. If that doesn’t sell you on the game in which you ride motorcycles, cars, flying swords, and even a dragon through neon-soaked fantasy environments, well then hopefully <em>this </em>sentence did. <strong>You can pick up </strong><em><strong>Sayonara Wild Hearts </strong></em><strong>for just $7.79 and you won’t regret it.</strong><br></p><hr><p>There’s a lot of different experiences to choose from here. If I had to narrow it down to make it easier for you all, <em>Outer Wilds </em>is one of my all-time favorite games. It features a stirring narrative, a wonderful central mystery, a score that’ll bring you to tears, and best of all, a horror-themed expansion that came out a few years later, in case you’re still in the mood for some scares. <em>Outer Wilds </em>has got it all.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I'm going to post most of it here because it's important you read each unhinged line:</p><blockquote><div><p>At long last, I am ready to talk about what I'm doing next: I am working on driving a "once in a generation" inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</p><p>I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster, and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams.&nbsp;</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Verdu then moved onto some staffing and internal policy stuff before closing with:</p><blockquote><div><p>GenAI is that next challenge. I don't think I've been this excited about an opportunity in this industry since the 90s, when we saw a new game launch every few months that redefined what was possible. It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months.</p><p>I can't believe how lucky I am to be alive when a wave this big is about to hit the game industry. Many view this technology with fear, but I am a game-maker at heart and I see its potential to unlock all of us, to create mind-blowing new experiences for players, to lift us to new heights. Yes, we'll have to adapt and change, but when have we failed to meet that challenge as an industry?</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I dunno man, the games industry seems utterly incapable of<a href="https://aftermath.site/layoffs-are-the-vibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> meeting any of the challenges it's currently facing</a>? Let alone a "wave this big" that he <em>thinks</em> is made of money and great games but will actually just be more layoffs and machine-generated slop?</p><p>Also great work trumpeting this just days after closing down a whole studio, including three of its very experienced leaders. It didn't "enable" shit for them!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In front of thousands of fans in Times Square, with most of the sprawling screens displaying his face, Snoop Dogg provided a twist on one of hip-hop’s iconic lines. “It ain’t nothin’ but a gangsta party,” he chanted. “It ain’t nothin’ but a <em>Fortnite </em>gangsta party.”&nbsp;The moment was part of a concert that also featured Ice Spice, all performed live in New York while being broadcast as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285464/fortnite-remix-the-prelude-event-how-to-watch">an in-game event for anyone logged in to the game</a>. The battle royale has had plenty of concerts and events in recent years, but the Snoop collaboration is part of a plan to more deeply integrate music into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24065901/fortnite-metaverse-disney-epic-partnership">the budding metaverse</a>.</p><p>“This is a partnership,” Snoop said during an interview after the show. “Most games just want one song and you don’t even see the artist. So for them to let us be a part of the game, and that community, it’s deep.”</p><p>In the past, <em>Fortnite</em>’s big musical moments have largely been singular virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>. But over the years, music has steadily permeated the game to the point that Snoop’s Times Square performance was just a kickoff point for a monthlong event.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s current season, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">dubbed Chapter 2 Remix</a>, debuted this weekend, rewinding the clock with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole">a version of the battle royale map from several years ago</a>. But there’s a twist — hence the “remix” in the title. Each week, the game will change slightly, themed around a different artist. Snoop is up first. You can enlist him as a companion, visit a heavily guarded Dogg Pound compound, or rock out as his tracks play on the radio as you drive around the island.</p><p>If you boot up <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, the rhythm game developed by <em>Rock Band</em> studio Harmonix, he’s the new headlining act, which means you can buy his songs to play along to, unlock Snoop-themed guitars and drum sets, and buy a crip walk emote that plays “Drop It Like It’s Hot.” Snoop will be followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD, with future updates introducing elements like <a href="https://x.com/andredotuasset/status/1853219859741475322?t=EH9BlSHw3u3Xp4yw0XECiA">a gun that spits Eminem lyrics</a>.</p><p>According to Nate Nanzer, head of global partnerships at <em>Fortnite</em> developer Epic, there have been two key points in the evolution of music in the game that led to this point. The first was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott’s “Astronomical” concert</a>, which showed the scale possible with these kinds of virtual events, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count">an audience topping 12 million</a>. “After we did Travis Scott we had everybody coming to us saying ‘Hey, I want to do that,’” says Nanzer.</p><p>The second was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">the launch of <em>Fortnite Festival</em> last year</a>. Like the battle royale mode, <em>Festival</em> has seasons, each “headlined” by a different artist, which, to date, has included stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079009/lady-gaga-comes-to-fortnite-tomorrow">Lady Gaga</a>. “If you look at all of the things we did prior, they tended to be more one-off,” says Nanzer. “We’d do an event, and then months or even years would go by before we did something else. What <em>Festival</em> did was give us this venue to be able to celebrate music more regularly.</p><p>For Snoop’s son Cordell Broadus, there was one particular moment that convinced him Snoop should be in <em>Fortnite</em>. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/21/23034095/fortnite-wu-tang-clan-gear">a collaboration with the Wu-Tang Clan</a> featured an in-game glider that would play the chorus to “C.R.E.A.M” as players flew down to the battle royale island. “I kept saying: ‘I gotta put his music in there,’” he explains. “Because every time I play<em> Fortnite</em> that’s what I hear. So a lot of the inspiration came from seeing them doing it, and seeing that <em>Fortnite</em>’s not afraid to really deal with hardcore hip-hop.”</p><p>That feeling grew stronger as the more ambitious virtual concerts continued to make waves. “We’re real competitive,” says Broadus. “So we’re competing with Travis Scott. What he did with <em>Fortnite </em>was huge, and I feel like we topped that tonight. But we’ll let the people decide.” (Snoop was quick to clarify that “I didn’t say that, he said that.”)</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> collaborations that get headlines — and a prime Friday night spot in Times Square — feature huge artists. But part of turning the game into a viable venue for music, according to Nanzer, is integrating it in multiple ways so that all kinds of artists can be featured. In addition to virtual concerts and headlining <em>Festival</em>, there are the emotes, in-game radio stations, and individual tracks you can buy to play in <em>Festival</em>.</p><div><p>Not all of these ideas have worked out. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike">Epic tried to create a virtual tour stop for artists in 2020</a>, going so far as to build out a studio space in Los Angeles, and the effort has largely fizzled out. But as the company continues to try to push <em>Fortnite</em> beyond its battle royale roots, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">a concentrated focus on community-made games and experiences</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">a still-mysterious virtual world built with Disney</a>, music is another important tool to make the game more than just another live-service shooter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">an increasingly difficult space to compete in</a>. That’s true at various scales, from Snoop in New York to an indie band getting its first airtime on a <em>Fortnite</em> radio station.</p></div><p>“We want to work with the biggest artists in the world,” says Nanzer, “but we also want to figure out if we can break artists in <em>Fortnite</em>.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Then there are the more nitty gritty details like how magic is getting brought in or what exactly happened in the final scene of season one.

We have no idea! Season one didn’t really wrap up any of the larger conflicts at play in the world of <em>Arcane</em>. Instead, it left things on the precipice of all out war. To that end, Jinx launched a rocket directly into the chambers of Piltover’s ruling council. That leaves a lot of major players from season one with a big question mark over their heads. Jayce, Mel, and Caitlyn’s mother Cassandra are all within the council at the time. Trailers for season two have kept the fallout of this attack underwraps but Caitlyn appears on the warpath, so it is likely her mom was a casualty of the attack. Whatever the death toll is revealed to be, you can be sure this battle will be the match that lights the powder keg of season two.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central conflict around which all of <em>Arcane </em>revolves is the growing tension between the cities of Piltover and Zaun. The former is a thriving city full of wealth and technology and home to people like Caitlyn and Jayce. The latter is an undercity beneath it that is a relative slum in comparison to the grandeur of Piltover. Due to the constant pollution of Zaun it has become the home of the poor and disenfranchised, which also means crime runs rampant. As a result, Piltover heavily polices the area and has created a major class divide. This is where Vi and Jinx grew up.</p><p>Season one saw these class tensions come to a head in a huge skirmish on the streets of Zaun that ended with the death of de facto leader and crime lord Silco. Season two teasers tell us that the production of the drug Shimmer is still occuring in Zaun, even without Silco, so Caitlyn and a group of Enforcers are coming in to put an end to it all. I’m sure nothing bad will happen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>Arcane </em>is a tale of two cities, it is even more a tale of two sisters. Vi and Powder (who grows up to be Jinx during the events of season one) are the heart of the show. Act one of season one focused on the pair’s upbringing in Zaun, which ended in their separation with Vi thinking Powder was dead and Powder being taken under the wing of Silco. The rest of the season revolved around Vi’s attempt to save her sister (now going by the name Jinx) from the influence of Silco.</p><p>That didn’t end up working out and by season one’s end Vi had come to terms with the idea that Jinx is no longer her sister. Season two positions their final confrontation as the main event, with Vi even admitting her sister is gone and that only Jinx remains. Along with Caitlyn, she’s ready to take down Jinx no matter what. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At the start of season one Caitlyn is shown to be a Piltover citizen whose heart is in the right place, even if she doesn’t understand the realities of the world. As a rookie enforcer she wants to uphold justice and the law, but quickly finds after teaming up with Vi and falling into the city’s larger conflict that no side is without blood on its hands. Vi opens her up to the humanity of Zaun’s inhabitants, while betrayals from crooked enforcers above her show her that maybe this isn’t all black and white. Even after the final skirmish of season one, Caitlyn seems like a person who truly wants to change the relationship between Zaun and Piltover to change for the betterment of both sides.</p><p>Of course if her mom is dead that changes things. Season two already looks to put Caitlyn on the warpath, but grief may be blinding her temporarily. With the council attacked, Caitlyn seems to be something of a leader for the city now, and Jinx has fallen into a similar role in Zaun. Maybe the two will still find a way to overcome the cycles of violence their cities have been stuck in for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mel’s mother played a relatively small part in <em>Arcane </em>season one, but that will likely change in the final season.

Specifically she wants in on weaponized Hextech, the technology Jayce invented. With the council potentially out of the way, Ambessa is in a great position to grab control of Piltover, which would only mean bad things for the relationship between it and Zaun.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>League of Legends</em> is full of magic wielders, but <em>Arcane </em>has almost none in its first season.

<p>There was a lot about Star Wars Outlaws that I thoroughly enjoyed, but its combat wasn’t one of them. I cheesed the system whenever possible, using stealth or outright taking a long route around enemies to avoid combat. It felt awkward, clunky, and barebones. Apparently, that will all change with Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4, which aims to improve the game’s feel and approach, specifically combat, and embrace player-choice-driven gameplay, allowing you to tackle encounters and missions more freely. It’s a welcome change that we hope will entice returning players.</p>



<p>This reveal stems from a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent official blog post</a> by the Star Wars Outlaws team, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-full-release-star-wars-outlaws-get-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner</a>, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty. For now, let’s focus on the gameplay enhancements coming in title update 1.4, namely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long—Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4 launches alongside the game on Steam on <strong>November 21</strong>.</p>

<p>The popular video game, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, which was released back in 2019, just had images leaked online of it being tested on PSN (PlayStation Network). Since its release, the game has been a staple within the PC and Xbox community but has never seen the light of day on a PlayStation console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-being-tested-on-psn">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Being Tested on PSN</h2>



<p>The original Age of Empires II was first released back in 1999. For its 20th anniversary, the game got the Definitive Edition just back in 2019. Xbox and PC gamers were lucky enough to indulge in this classic, but it was never brought over to PlayStation. In fact, no Age of Empires game has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</p>



<p>However, leaked images online show that PSN subscribers could soon be getting the title brought over to their respective consoles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak first surfaced when Reddit user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/draconis90/">u/draconis90</a>, posted the image above on Reddit, which shows two players playing the game on PlayStation. </p>



<p>However, the user also states that this could just be a graphics bug.</p>



<p>Still, not too long ago, Tom Warren, a Senior Editor at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, leaked that the game could be getting a PlayStation release in the early months of 2025. Still, no known information has been released since except for the leaked image above.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-this-all-mean">What Does This All Mean?</h2>



<p>So, what does all of this mean? Will Age of Empires fans finally be getting a title on PlayStation? Or is it simply just a bug that appeared? </p>



<p>While many are speculating on whether or not this image is real, there have been zero other gamers to emerge and claim they have seen the same glitch happen in their game.</p>



<p>Tell us your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>I wasn’t among the countless who positively despised Star Wars Outlaws upon its release. Sure, it wasn’t the best open-world game, but it certainly wasn’t the worst. It was missing something, and apparently, Ubisoft feels the same, as its latest blog post for the game announces not only Title Update 1.4 but also the fact that Star Wars Outlaws has a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official blog post</a> on the Star Wars Outlaws site, Ubisoft said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Outlaws,</em></p>



<p><em>I’m very excited to be stepping into the role of Creative Director on Star Wars Outlaws and to be working with the incredibly passionate team here at Massive Entertainment along with our talented co-development studios around the world and Lucasfilm Games. I would like to personally thank you, our community, for your positive response to the game. We see and love all the fan arts, comments, and videos you’ve created around the game, and it continues to provide joy and inspiration to the team. We truly hope you’re enjoying your journey across the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix thus far.</em></p>



<p><em>I also want to take the time to say that we hear not only your positive feedback, but your constructive feedback as well. Thank you for sharing with us and helping us make the game even better. Today, I want to share with you the next priority areas we are looking to address to ensure that Star Wars Outlaws is the best experience possible for you.</em></p>



<p><em>From before launch and continuing into post-launch, we have been gathering data from and listening to you. This takes place not only formally through our analytics, user tests, reviews and media feedback, our Star Wars Outlaws Bug Reporter, crash reports, and other mechanisms, but also informally when we see your YouTube videos and Reddit, Discord or other social media posts. We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you’re enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>



<p><em>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us. And if you’re new to the game, there’s never been a better time to experience the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix!</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’re unsure what’s coming in the next Star Wars Outlaws update. According to the post, the community has highly requested fixes and features, and there are likely plenty of quality-of-life tweaks, but there’s no telling just yet. The team promises to share more about Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.4 on social media later, but it’s scheduled to hit on November 21st, so we expect to hear more soon!</p>

<p>By now, you’ve undoubtedly heard about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-says-star-wars-outlaws-performance-contributed-to-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did you know Star Wars Outlaws’ performance directly contributed to Ubisoft’s decision</a>? It’s true, and Insider Gaming reported on the matter recently!</p>

Although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>players quickly took to this year’s Call of Duty</u></a> when its release date arrived a few weeks back, many have made it clear that there are more than a few kinks left to deal with. Today’s update is one of the beefiest yet, as it tackles common issues and more while promising to provide even more specific fixes in the future.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/wccfcallofdutyblackops63-1724866203623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Update Address Flashbang and Spawn Complaints</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One tool that players of every skill level can’t seem to stand is the flashbang, which has been called out for the lengthy affect it has on players’ screens. On smaller maps like Nuketown, of which there are a few of in Black Ops 6, the flashbang leaves Operators unable to see their screen for long portions of each match. Post update, players will notice that the duration of the effect has been reduced by 20%. Whether it calms complaints remains to be seen, but it’s clear Treyarch is at least listening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other common talking points the team sought to address with today’s patch include the spawn system and Recon Combat Specialty. The former is often a point of contention in any Call of Duty entry, so it should be nice to hear that spawn logic has been tuned across “several” Multiplayer maps in Black Ops 6.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Spawn tuning will be an ongoing process of taking in data, reviewing gameplay and making measured adjustments in the live environment," a developer note says. "Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recon, meanwhile, has left many concerned thanks to its ability to allow players to see through walls for a short time after respawning. The Perk combination bonus has now had its duration reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5, with Treyarch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>promising to reduce it even further</u></a> ahead of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the highlights for those looking for a less frustrating Multiplayer experience, but a number of weapon balance adjustments found their way into the November 4 Black Ops 6 update, too. Assault rifles like the XM4 and Model L received nerfs to their long-range damage, while more than a few SMGs had their range buffed. Most of the new Black Ops 6 patch focuses on tweaking Multiplayer, but Zombies players will notice that GobbleGum names should now properly update when players switch between tier tabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s update follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-1-patch-fixes-troublesome-black-screen-glitch-and-other-issues"><u>a November 1 patch</u></a> that squashed a number of bugs and exploits across the Multiplayer and Zombies modes. Although today’s fix fleshes out the experience even more, the team will surely polish the FPS further in the coming days and weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched October 25 and will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>begin its first season of content on November 14</u></a>.

We gave Multiplayer an 8/10, saying, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 plays it safe but is otherwise exactly what Call of Duty multiplayer should be: fast, fun, and a little on the ridiculous side.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything else revealed in today’s patch, you can see the list of all the changes below.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> version 1.6 launched for PC in March, but console and mobile players were told they'd have to wait for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-stardew-valley-1-6-update/2900-5177/#11" data-ref-id="2900-5177">enormous free update</a> to land on their platform of choice. Stardew Valley developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone paused all work on his next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, to focus on getting Stardew Valley's final major update out on all platforms, and months later, the 1.6.9 update is now available for all players.</p><p>The 1.6.9 update includes a number of useful features, like the ability to put legendary-tier fish in ponds and a couple of new ways for players to to rescue items they've accidentally lost. The update also includes bug fixes, balance tweaks, and new gameplay features.</p><p>As far as the new stuff goes, the Stardew Valley 1.6.9 update adds the following features to the game:</p><ul><li>If you lose an item that can’t be found again, check the Secret Woods for a new NPC who can get it back... for a price. </li><li>Players can now put legendary fish in fish ponds. Only one fish can fit in each pond. Ponds with legendary fish will produce legendary fish roe. Each legendary fish turns the pond's water a different color.</li><li>Players can now place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture.</li><li>Items dropped in water will now float for a brief time, so players can collect them if they're quick (or if they have a magnet ring).</li><li>Sam and Shane's work portraits will now appear inside JojaMartas long as they're working there.</li><li>Some dialogue has been slightly tweaked.</li><li>New Easter eggs have been added to the game.</li><li>Hidden cheat commands have been added (on platforms where a save edit is possible).</li></ul><p>Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-dev-finally-finishes-playing-the-game-says-1-6-update-is-coming-to-console-next-week/1100-6527481/" data-ref-id="1100-6527481">confirmed the update's release date</a> in a post on the Stardew Valley forums back in September. The 1.6.9 update contains content than the original 1.6 update lacked, including quality-of-life changes like pine trees providing extra lumber, weeds no longer preventing fruit trees from growing, and the addition of new items to certain in-game shops.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that the update <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853506548250869801" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">isn't yet working for PlayStation users in Europe</a>. Additionally, it seems to have caused a bug resulting in <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">disappearing chickens</a> for new players using the Meadowlands farm. Barone acknowledged both issues on Twitter, and confirmed that he's currently working to fix them.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look at the full 1.6.9 patch notes, or check them out via <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official website</a>.</p><h2>Stardew Valley 1.6.9 patch notes</h2><h3>New content &amp; features</h3><ul><li>If you lost an item that can’t be found again, a <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods#Lost_Items_Shop" rel="nofollow ">new friend appears in the secret woods</a> who can get it back (for a price).</li><li>You can now put legendary fish in fish ponds.

                <p dir="ltr">A new update arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on November 4, and the patch notes include several major changes. This includes nerfs to the overpowered flashbangs and the Recon Combat Speciality bonus. The game's snaking movement has also been reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the patch notes, Treyarch says there's been "enough snaking," and the movement is now nerfed. Snaking is an exploit where a player rapidly switches between the prone and crouch positions while stationed behind a cover, making themselves harder to hit. However, that movement will be slower and less impactful with the update adjusting the stance-change cooldowns to reduce effectiveness of repeated snaking motion.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also adjusts the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/controversial-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-x-ray-vision-perk-is-in-treyarch-crosshairs/1100-6527561/">frustrating Recon Combat Speciality</a> bonus, which previously gave players too much information. Now, the Recon bonus will only provide users with limited-time wall hacks for 1.5 seconds instead of 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update has nerfed the game's powerful flashbangs, reducing the equipment's screen effect duration by 20%. The update only changes how powerful flashbangs are, but it doesn't mention the current XP exploit that lets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xp-farming-trick-turns-you-into-a-terrible-teammate/1100-6527534/">players toss flashbangs for extra points</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A few weapons received tuning with the new update. This includes slight nerfs to damage and the range of popular assault rifles, such as the XM4, Ames 85, and Model L. All weapons in the submachine class were buffed with higher damage ranges, which Treyarch says is meant to make the guns more effective during mid-range fights.</p><p dir="ltr">The popular Nuketown map was added to the game in a 24/7 playlist on November 1, but now the new update makes the map available to play in private matches.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/">Call of Duty Season 1</a> arrives on November 14. The big update will integrate Black Ops 6's content and game mechanics into Warzone.

Every day we monitor both player feedback and game data to keep tabs on how the weapon meta is evolving and prepare for a comprehensive tuning pass in Season 01.</p><p>We have seen the discussions about the relative balance of Assault Rifles and Submachine Guns, and we are making some early, general changes to adjust their effective ranges. For ARs, we are pulling in minimum damage ranges and lessening the impact of headshots at close range. SMGs are receiving damage range increases to improve their mid-range effectiveness.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assault Rifle Adjustments</h2><h3 dir="ltr">XM4</h3><p dir="ltr">XM4 Damage Adjustments</p><p dir="ltr">Maximum Damage</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Pre-Patch: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Post-Patch: 21</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Maximum Damage Range</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Pre-patch: 0 -

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the first-ever dev update released by the Star Wars Outlaws team, they decided to use it to bring in these dev updates to provide insights from the developers while they continue adding new content to Star Wars Outlaws to improve the game further. The first major announcement made in this dev update was that Drew Rechner is now the Creative Director for Star Wars Outlaws. On the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft website</a>, he wrote a big announcement, talking about the team's plans to fix up Star Wars Outlaws and what they can do to continue to improve it.</p>
<p>"Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we've focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns, such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-3-improves-stealth-and-enemy-ai/">particularly around stealth</a>, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we're looking to improve the game even further," says Rachner.</p>
<p>They plan to continue to improve the combat, where they want to add "more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision." They also want to focus more on the stealth aspect of the game, something that has been highly controversial for those who have been getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws. Since the beginning, the stealth has been a huge issue for gamers, as it started off with the stealth missions being too challenging, with players getting caught immediately. Since then, they have worked to update the stealth mechanic and try to make it a smoother experience for those playing Star Wars Outlaws. They are now continuing to improve it by working on the readability and consistency of enemy detection.</p>
<p>Their third key area of focus is working on the character controls to make finding cover and utilizing it more reliable, as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. While these are just three key areas they're planning on focusing on, they have said that there will be more added in the next Title Update 1.4, which will be released on November 21. Along with this update, Star Wars Outlaws will finally be on Steam, as well as the first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</p>
<p>It's said by both Rachner and the team that the Title Update 1.4 will be the "biggest update yet," so players can only hope that this update doesn't break things further and actually improves the experience of this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">controversial title</a>.</p>

The big news is that on November 9, players on Steam will be able to finally play the highly-anticipated<em> Halo 2</em> Earth City demo. </p><p> “The response to the demo at E3 [2003] was electric, and nearly every <em>Halo </em>fan remembers that demo and where they were when they were first blinded by its majesty,” said <em>Halo </em>community director Brian Jarrard. “Best of all, none of us ever would have expected that 20+ years later, a group of passionate community modders would bring this demo to life as a full-fledged mission.” </p><p>According to the blog post, many technical issues kept this demo “locked away for many years.” However, thanks to a lot of hard work by many people (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-2-master-chief-collection-steam-pc-mod-cut-content-1851688832&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-2-master-chief-collection-steam-pc-mod-cut-content-1851688832">including community modders</a></span>), the original assets and files for the Earth City demo were recovered. But getting the old content working in newer versions of the <em>Halo </em>engine was very tricky. </p><p>The main community member who helped lead the charge for getting the Earth City demo finished and playable in the <em>Master Chief Collection </em>was Steven “General_101" Garcia. According to the post, he was a “one-man army” and helped improve the demo’s art, scripts, and more. Then other modders, including Ludus, Neo Te Aika, Sean T, xScruffyDaSasquatchx, and Killzone, hopped in to finish up the level and make it play like the original E3 demo. </p><p>The remastered <em>Halo 2</em> E3 Demo arrives November 9 as a free mod on Steam Workshop for PC players. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
