            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Black folks are loud. We laugh loud, we love loud, we protest loud. But when we really want to show our approval, we get quiet first. When we laugh at something funny, like <em>really</em> laugh, it sounds like a thin wheeze before sound bursts forth like a storm. And within seconds of starting <em>South of Midnight</em>, as I walked around the protagonist Hazel’s home and seeing a piece of art that was an obvious and deliberate homage to the painter Annie Lee’s <a href="https://umojafinearts.com/products/blue-monday"><em>Blue Monday</em></a>, I wordlessly put my Steam Deck down and took a quiet lap around my living room before I started <em>shouting</em>.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is the latest title from Compulsion Games, a Canadian studio best known for making <em>We Happy Few</em>. It follows Hazel, a young woman who must rescue her mother after a hurricane sweeps their home away. Along her journey, she comes into her powers as a Weaver, or guardians who can see the strands that connect all life in what’s known as the Grand Tapestry and can repair it when those strands get knotted by pain and trauma.</p><p>The game is an action platformer. Hazel progresses by using her Weaver abilities to heal the blighted landscape and defeat enemies called haints – a Southern term used to describe ghosts or monsters. She’s aided on her quest by Crouton, her childhood stuffed toy come to life by powerful magic. He can take over enemies’ bodies, cause them to fight on Hazel’s side, and can squeeze into places she’s too big to reach.</p><p>I love when a piece of media talks to me as a Black person. A TV show, cartoon, or even a video game will have tiny visual references or phrases that are like a secret code. I see or hear them and know a Black person left this for me to find. What made me <em>holler</em> about South of Midnight was that its writers went for the deep cuts. They put in the kind of stuff you only know about if at least three of your four grandparents were American Black. Back in the day, <em>everyone </em>on both sides of my family had Annie Lee artwork in the house. If it wasn’t <em>Blue Monday</em>, it was <a href="https://www.blackartdepot.com/products/sixty-pounds-annie-lee?srsltid=AfmBOoq-gD85AlAumSQDqKc7Y5R7xG67e6D_Rr_NbhWJvg6UbVjmfHg-"><em>Sixty Pounds</em></a> — which my mother had hanging above the window in our kitchen.</p><div><p>What made me <em>holler</em> about South of Midnight was that its writers went for the deep cuts.</p></div><p>That kind of acknowledgement is everywhere in the game. It’s in the way Hazel and her mother, Lacey, speak to each other, the words they use, and their intonation. Hazel mutters something disrespectful, and her mother immediately calls her out: “I thought you was grown.” It’s in the way Catfish, the magical and overly large catfish who guides Hazel on her quest, reminds me of my two <em>very</em> country uncles. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/617373/south-of-midnight-preview-interview-ahmed-best">Earlier this year when I spoke to Ahmed Best</a>, the voice and motion capture director for the game, he talked about how he wanted to ensure every aspect came across as authentic — right down to the way folks stood. I saw that come through in the way Hazel fans herself <em>just so</em> to keep the Mississippi heat at bay. Instead of standing straight up, she tilts her head to the side as she waves her hand the exact same way Memphis-born aunties do. </p><p>The details were so small, but they accumulated in my heart like the waters behind a levee. Every time I discovered something new — like noticing one of the game’s chapter titles referenced Zora Neale Hurston’s novel <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> — the emotion would burst forth as a flood of tears. </p><p>And it’s not just the narrative that pays homage to Black and Southern tradition and culture; the gameplay does, too. Instead of <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/yellow-paint-in-video-games-needs-to-stop">the much (and unfairly) maligned yellow paint</a> used to denote a climbable surface, <em>South of Midnight</em> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haint_blue">a very specific shade of blue</a> — the color Black people in the South would use to paint their porches to keep evil spirits away. There was a moment when I saw blue butterflies hovering over a cliff surrounded by water that kills Hazel if she touches it. Knowing the game uses blue to show you where you can safely go, I took a leap of faith over the edge and found a secret power-up. The game spoke to me using the language of my ancestors, and I heard it. Once again, I hollered.</p><p>As much as<em> South of Midnight</em> made me yell, its combat did make me groan a little bit. Every combat encounter follows the same extremely basic formula. Enemies show up in an arena, you kill them, heal the wound causing the enemies to appear, repeat ad nauseam with particular emphasis on the nausea part. It’s so formulaic that combat feels vestigial, like it was put there as an afterthought to give players something else to do. Hazel’s abilities don’t feel particularly fun or interesting to use, and, honestly, the game doesn’t even need combat at all. The storytelling is so strong that <em>South of Midnight</em> would be just as compelling as a purely narrative experience with some light platforming action. </p><div><p>Honestly, the game doesn’t even need combat at all</p></div><p>In a lot of cases, in order for Black media to get widespread attention or critical acclaim, it must be centered on luridly depicting trauma. The opposite isn’t all that great either, wherein a piece of Black media overcorrects and completely refuses to acknowledge traumatic realities that inform our existence. <em>South of Midnight</em> deftly straddles those two schools of thought in a pointed way that I’ve never seen before.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> sees me. It gets me. Its creators wanted to craft a love letter to a culture not often depicted in video games, and they did exactly that. At a time when my government is trying to do everything in its power to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/jackie-robinson-army-history-dei-military-department-defense-rcna197067">erase my people</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trump-executive-order-to-force-changes-at-smithsonian-institution-targeting-funding-for-programs-with-improper-ideology">their history</a>, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-park-service-restores-harriet-tubman-feature-webpage/story?id=120605884">their contributions to the US</a>, I cannot overstate the power that lies in being seen — especially coming from a place like video games, which is often violently hostile if it bothers to acknowledge folks like me at all.</p><p>This game came out right on time, right in the moment when a narrative like this was needed the most. <em>South of Midnight</em> is a loving and worshipful praise song of the culture and people it depicts that made it hard for me to stay quiet for long.</p><p><sub><em>South of Midnight </em>is out now on Xbox, Xbox Game Pass, and Windows PC.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Previously £54.95, that's a massive £15 saving for a critically well-received RPG that will take you at least 40 to 60 hours just to complete the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been distracted by all the other huge games that have come out in the last few months— like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii"> Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, just to name a few—this is the perfect chance to return to the Kingdom of Bohemia with a massive bargain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few other UK retailers who have followed suit, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4YjL?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Argos</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxBkA?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Currys,</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGJ4q?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smyths</a> bringing the price down to £39.99. TGC is still the cheapest by 4p, but if stock runs out on PS5, we'd recommend going to Currys next since it does free next day delivery and is also the Day One Edition, containing the pre-order bonus quest— "The Lion's Crest". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Argos can do free shipping as well, but only if you collect from a store or place an online order over £100, otherwise costing you at least an extra £3.95 for home delivery. Plus, while Argos is selling the Day One Edition on Xbox Series X, it's only selling the standard version without the bonus quest on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Smyths is only selling the standard version on both platforms, neither without the pre-order bonus quest. That said, it still makes a better price than those currently at other retailers. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on PS5 at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EmgV?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon UK</a>, for example, currently costs £57.77 at the lowest. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YWB8?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ShopTo</a> has cut its prices on the game slightly, but not as much, only going as low as £47.85 for the game on Xbox Series X|S. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can get Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for as low as £38.49 on PC through sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR3OP1?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CDKeys</a>, deals like The Games Collection's are the cheapest ways to play the game on console. KCD2 is still priced much higher on each system's digital platforms—£59.99 on both the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Games Store</a>. If you have either console with a disc drive, The Game Collection, Currys, or Smyths are your best options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

                <p>EA Sports hasn't even officially announced College Football 26, but now more details about the game have emerged from an unexpected source. The home improvement chain Lowe's has <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/press-releases/game-lowes-appear-multiple-ea-sports-titles-first-time-04-11-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> a collaboration with EA Sports to feature its branding in CFB 26, along with the newest EA Sports FC and Madden NFL titles.</p><p>Lowe's branding will appear in these games "across multiple gameplay experiences," the retailer said. For CFB 26, Lowe's branding will show up on the broadcast overlay for the Stadium Pulse feature. This feature aims to replicate the pressure of playing an away game by making certain gameplay elements more difficult for a short period of time. Lowe's said this draws "meaningful parallels to the passion homeowners feel when enhancing their own spaces with Lowe's."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475053" data-ratio="0.56259259259259" data-width="2700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475053"></a><figcaption>A render of the Lowe's interactive gaming experience that's going on a road trip.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg"></figure><p>In EA Sports FC and Madden NFL, Lowe's branding will show up in the popular Ultimate Team modes.</p><p>The partnership extends to real life as well, as Lowe's is debuting an "On the Road" interactive gaming experience as part of a nationwide tour for the college football and NFL seasons. More details about this are coming later this year.</p><p>Lowe's said the idea with all of this is to help reach people who might be considering a home project and remind them to shop at Lowe's instead of a competitor.</p><p>"This is such an immersive and unexpected way to introduce ourselves to the next generation of home improvers," Lowe's marketing boss Jen Wilson said.</p><p>CFB 26 has big shoes to fill, as 2024's CFB 25 was the year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 best-selling game in the US</a>, only beaten by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. There was more than a decade of pent-up demand for the game following the last entry in 2013, so it'll be interesting to see how CFB 26 fares by comparison. </p>

Shin-Shibuya will be retired from the ranked play mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 also includes the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-season-2-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-6463/">Flower of Krakoa battle pass</a>, which features several heroes all glammed up for Emma Frost's big gala event. Squirrel Girl also gets a cool punk-themed "Nut Rocker" costume, and Spider-Man has the "Spider-Oni" skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 2 adds a gifting feature to the game. Players can now gift all those fun cosmetics to their friends.</p><p dir="ltr">The big update makes changes for console platforms to include several sensitivity adjustments. These new options should make aiming and movement easier to customize to a player's preference. This includes additional deadzone settings for both triggers and thumbsticks.</p><p dir="ltr">On the PC side, players can now try an "experimental feature" called the Switch Shader Compilation Mode. The developer describes this as a way to potentially make Marvel Rivals run smoother by compiling shaders only when launching Marvel Rivals for the first time after an update to either the game or graphics driver. This is designed to significantly reduce memory usage and minimize in-game stuttering, but the developer warns that additional stutters can happen depending on the power of the player's PC hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">A few map improvements are included for Season 2. This update corrects terrain issues that could previously cause characters to become stuck or clip through odd locations. It also addresses several sound issues on various maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Several hero adjustments are also detailed in the patch notes. This includes Iron Fist's Floating Fumble, which could sometimes cause the hero to end up floating indefinitely. Another fixes Captain America's Shield Bounce, as the hero previously couldn't ricochet enemy projectiles while moving backward. Now, Cap can send projectiles flying no matter which way he is moving.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire list of hero improvements can be found in the patch notes below, as <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250401/41548_1223996.html" rel="nofollow ">shared by the developer</a>.</p><h2>Marvel Rivals Version 20250411 Patch Notes</h2><h2>1.

A dazzling new costume for reaching Gold — Emma Frost - Golden Diamond, along with new Crests of Honor for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and Top 500.</p><p>3.

(If you have previously completed at least one valid competitive match, you can still join Competitive in Season 2.0 even if you are below level 15.)</p><p>4. Pick/ban will now come into play starting from Gold III rather than Diamond tier.</p><p>5. When a team includes players from Eternity or One Above All, only solo or duo queuing will be allowed.</p><p>6. Currently, the score you earn per Competitive match is determined by both the outcome and your individual performance.

This feature can significantly reduce memory usage and minimize in-game stuttering. —Especially on systems with 16 GB of RAM or less.</p><p>However, if you're using a CPU with less threads in combination with AMD FSR3 Frame Generation, you may notice occasional additional stutters with this feature enabled.</p><p>*Please note: This is an experimental feature. If you encounter any issues during use, our support team is standing by ready to assist.</p><p>2. We've added support for AMD FSR 4, using an AI-accelerated upscaling algorithm to deliver image quality improvements over AMD FSR 3.1.

No more wobbly views for our heroes—everyone deserves to enjoy their epic returns in all their heroic glory!</p><p>⦁ Namor's Super Soldier Shenanigans: In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Super-Soldier Factory, Namor's Ultimate Ability could occasionally fail to deal damage when targeting the raising pillars.

<p>The director of Chainsaw Man is working on a new roguelite horror game on Roblox called The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/534957/article/chainsaw-man-director-reveals-his-next-project-is-a-roblox-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, The Inn’s official <a href="https://x.com/TheInnRoblox/status/1909996710543421643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) revealed the upcoming Roblox game with a new trailer recently, informing players that Ryu Nakayama, the director of Chainsaw Man, is directing the title. Nakayama is known for his work on projects like Jujutsu Kaisen, Yatterman Night, and more. Nakayama hasn’t worked on a game before The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Inn’s trailer starts with the players stepping into a traditional Japanese inn, which seems inviting from the outside but dreadful from the inside. We see some rooms engulfed in flames, supernatural beings popping up in jump scares, blood splattered everywhere, and other horror elements. No release date or window was provided for the game. </p>



<p>On the Chainsaw Man Director’s personal <a href="https://x.com/r_nkym_/status/1910016940346859949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account, Nakayama revealed that he is working on the Roblox Horror Game in collaboration with Mayflower. It is his “first time working on a game” and has been a “challenging and exciting” experience. The director added that even though he knows that Roblox is a popular platform in North America,&nbsp; he is “deliberately trying to give it a stronger Japanese feel” (as translated by Google on X).&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild and its DLC will set players back $90 for its Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>That’s according to the mathmagician wizard out there (not really), who have calculated that whichever way you try to get the game and its DLC on the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s going to be $90.</p>



<p>That’s because Nintendo are notoriously bad for not discounting its games, no matter how old they are.</p>



<h2 id="h-90-quick-maths">$90, Quick Maths</h2>



<p>I first spotted these amazing calculations by Paul Tassi at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/04/11/nintendo-says-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-is-90-with-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, but basically, $90 is the number you get to no matter how you try and play the game on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For those looking to buy the game outright, it will set you back $70, plus the $20 DLC taking you to $90. For those looking to upgrade from the original Nintendo Switch version, you’ll still have to buy the game for $60 and need to buy the “enhanced” edition for an additional $10. Add on the $20 for the DLC and you’re at the $90 price point once again.</p>



<p>The news likely adds even more frustration to what has been a disastrous reveal for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s $450 console price point (which could still increase in the US following all the tariff shenanigans) has been a constant cause for debate in the community. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Nintendo Switch 2 Games Will Cost Up To $98 For Physical Games When Converted From Euros</a></strong></p>



<p>Admittingly, though, it’s a console that’s still going to fly off the shelves, but I’m personally finding Nintendo’s greed here a little hard to stomach, especially given the current economic climate. It seems like whichever way we look at it, more expensive games are going to be hitting us sooner rather than later. </p>



<p>What do you think about the current pricing structure from Nintendo? Will you be buying Zelda for $90?

From there, those looking to play together on different platforms will need to add each other's Larian account name to their in-game friend's list. Players will then be able to create a cross-play multiplayer lobby and invite people accordingly. One interesting wrinkle noted by Larian is that if the person hosting the lobby is playing on PC and joined by those playing on consoles or Mac, the lobby host will need to have less than 100 mods installed and only include mods accepted on consoles and Mac.</p><p dir="ltr">The real draw of the update, however, is the new subclasses. The full list of additions can be found below.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> on PC got its <a href="https://support.nixxes.com/hc/en-us/articles/26565118695837-The-Last-of-Us-Part-II-Remastered-PC-Patch-1-1">second patch</a> from developer Nixxes. This update addresses crashing issues that players reported, an audio issue players had while watching the Grounded documentary, fixes for the sliders in the display menu, and more.</p>
<p>However, it does not address the autosave issues that players have reported to Nixxes, which Nixxes says it is still working to fix. For now, Nixxes suggests players try a workaround if they do run into the issue and a potential explanation as to why the problem is occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>"<em>Our investigation shows that issues can occur when OneDrive or similar cloud services block the save file from being written,</em>" Nixxes wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1910698603439444167">post on X</a>. "<em>As a workaround, we suggest that you pause OneDrive while playing the game: Right-click the OneDrive icon in the Windows taskbar, click the gear icon and Pause sync.</em>"</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered arrived on PC right at the beginning of April, and in just over a week, Nixxes has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-hotfix/">two patches</a> for the game, addressing the big issues players were immediately reporting. At the pace Nixxes is working at, it likely won't take them too much longer to work out a fix for the autosave issue.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">dug into the PC port</a> for The Last of Us Part II Remastered when it arrived a little more than a week ago, and even without these patches, at the time he wrote that The Last of Us Part II Remastered "<em>is one of the best games ever made in its genre, and it is absolutely unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I. As such, it is hard not to recommend, even though it's an entirely straightforward, albeit not problematic, port</em>."</p>

Elsewhere, there’s photo mode, cross-play, and Xbox Series S split screen. Check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-due-out-in-2025-adds-12-new-subclasses-and-loads-more"><u>Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 8 patch notes</u></a> for more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 new subclasses:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bard - College of Glamour</strong><br>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast <strong>Mantle of Inspiration</strong> to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves <strong>Charmed</strong>. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with <strong>Mantle of Majesty</strong>. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barbarian - Path of Giants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the <strong>Giant’s Rage</strong> passive that grants both strength and size - allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cleric - Death Domain</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves - from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes <strong>Toll The Dead</strong>, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom - a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Druid - Circle of Stars</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three <strong>Starry Forms</strong> for their power - the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy - the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you'll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with <strong>Righteous Clarity</strong>, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with <strong>Divine Allegiance</strong>, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fighter - Arcane Archer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Monk - Drunken Master</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using <strong>Intoxicating Strike</strong>, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters' other abilities, like <strong>Sobering Realisation</strong> - which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The <strong>Cloud of Jellyfish</strong> deals extra lightning damage - potentially shocking your enemy. <strong>The Flurry of Moths</strong> deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The <strong>Legion of Bees</strong> deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogue - Swashbuckler</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to <strong>Blind</strong> them. Flick your weapon at a target to <strong>Disarm</strong> them. Or use your new <strong>Fancy Footwork</strong> passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer <strong>Superior Darkvision</strong>, as well as the ability to <strong>Shadow Walk</strong> between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed <strong>Hound of Ill Omen</strong> to harass your foes, and use <strong>Strength of the Grave</strong> to prevent you from being downed - ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warlock - Hexblade</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wizard - Bladesinging</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8, as Larian has signalled, is the final major update for the game and draws a line under what has been a remarkable time for the developer. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur’s Gate 3 launched to critical acclaim</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed">enormous commercial success</a> back in 2023, and has continued to sell strongly throughout 2024 and into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian shocked the gaming world by confirming its intention to leave Baldur’s Gate 3 and Dungeons &amp; Dragons behind to work on a brand new game, which it teased at various points before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable">announcing a media blackout to focus on the new mystery project</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">D&amp;D owner Hasbro. however, has teased plans to continue with the series. Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference last month, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Larian will celebrate the release of Patch 8 with a Twitch livestream in which senior systems designer, Ross Stephens, will run through the changes and additions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> publisher and developer Rebellion has announced that their new post-apocalyptic adventure in the British countryside has attracted more than <strong>2 million players</strong> within the game's first month.</p>
<p>Rebellion also shared a few in-game statistics about how players have been interacting with Atomfall, like the fact that players have killed more than 5.9 million enemies with cricket bats, ordered over 250,000 pints of beer, drunk 500,000 cups of tea and died from rat swarms more than 420,000 times. Rebellion also pointed out that 'tin of meat' is players' preferred in-game food choice, with more than 14.1 million tins of meat being consumed so far.</p>
<p>In the game's opening weekend, Atomfall surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/">1.5 million players</a>, so it's not surprising that it went well past 2 million within its first month of launch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It should also be pointed out that part of Atomfall reaching the audience it has is due in part to the game being available on Xbox Game Pass from day one. Still, even considering its inclusion in Microsoft's subscription service, 2 million players in weeks for a brand-new game is still an incredible feat.</p>
<p>Just one year ago, at the time of writing, there were no Fallout-esque games that took the adventure across the pond to the United Kingdom. Now, with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> last July and Atomfall, we have two of them. This brings up an interesting point as to whether we'll start to see the same kind of post-nuclear apocalypse setting happening outside the United States more often.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">review</a> of Atomfall, we said, "<em>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, and encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</em></p>
