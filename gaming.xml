                <p>Actor Jack Black had a role in 2020's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, and he's coming back in Pro Skater 3 + 4 to reprise that character and pull double duty by voicing another one as well.</p><p>Black will play Officer "Dick <em>and </em>Dick's UK-born twin, Constable Richard.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced through its Nintendo Today app that The Legend of Zelda movie will no longer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-will-arrive-in-cinemas-in-march-2027/">arrive in cinemas in March 2027</a>. Instead, a brand new release date of May 7th, 2027 has been given. The only reason that has been given is that this delay is due to production reasons, and no further information has been provided apart from that.</p>



<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>There are no details of any cast announcements for The Legend of Zelda movie, nor is there any details of what story this movie will have. We do not know if the movie will adapt one of the games or be an original plot, introducing new elements to The Legend of Zelda lore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rob Yescombe, the writer behind films like Outside the Wire and Jackpot!, and games like <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a> and The Invisible Hours, has secured the rights for The Invisible Hours after developer Tequila Works was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/">shuttered and auctioned off the rights to their IP</a>.</p>
<p>Yescombe secured the rights to The Invisible Hours in the auction, and now plans to remaster the VR game, presumably for modern headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and PS VR2, and develop a screen adaptation of it, though it's unclear if he intends to make a film or TV show of the game.</p>
<p>"<em>I adored making The Invisible Hours</em>," Yescombe said in a press release. "<em>Truly, the best creative experience of my life. Fans still reach out to me, even after all this time - they love it as much as I do. The VR hardware market has grown massively since 2017 - multiple millions of units - making The Invisible Hours a prime candidate to remaster for a new generation</em>."</p>
<p>Yescombe is currently trying to find partners to help him bring The Invisible Hours back, which, if he's successful in doing so, would be a happier ending compared to the one Tequila Works and all of the studios' titles currently have, which is the one where they were all sold at auction.</p>
<p>While he's right that the player base of VR owners is bigger than it was in 2017 when the game was first shown and in 2018 when it launched, it's still not the booming market that many developers have believed it could be. In 2025, VR has been a year away from being the next big thing for more than a decade at this point.</p>
<p>We'll see if Yescombe can find a partner and/or studio to remaster The Invisible Hours. Or at the very least, a studio willing to work on the screen adaptation, which could potentially be the more lucrative option for the murder mystery.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You airdropped in with the <em>Warmachine</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-gravediggers-command-starter-and-battlegroup-box-review" rel="nofollow">Gravediggers Command Starter and Battlegroup Box</a>, but the enemy has dug in harder than you thought, and you call for reinforcements. Steamforged Games has answered those calls, and the Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansions are ready for deployment.&nbsp;In&nbsp;this article,&nbsp;we'll have a look at what both boxes contain and how they fit into the Command Starter and Battlegroup Box.</p>

<p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases began with a brand-new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=JJvrSvU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=Wf9h_BqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When the Trenchers go to war, they don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>Airdrops Requested!</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction, and can trace their history back to the early days of <em>Warmachine</em> in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original <em>Warmachine</em> and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=bFIAVlEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=_v3MY3Up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Core Expansion includes a whole host of new units to add somre new tricks to your army.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Core Expansion Set includes a force that can be played out of the box, but you will have to make some choices on force construction, unlike the Gravediggers Command Starter Set, which will get you straight into the game. But if you're looking for a larger force, or you already have the command starter and want to expand, then the Core Expansion will suit you well.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Core Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Major Grant Vargus (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Lieutenant Stella Barron (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers A (Unit)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers B (Unit)</li>
	<li>Trollkin Express Sniper (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Heavy Machine Gun Crew (Solo)</li>
	<li>Mantlet (Light Airdrop / Defense)</li>
	<li>Gun Mages (Unit)</li>
	<li>Blocker (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Skirmisher (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>Leading the box from the front is Major Vargus, who has Fleet and Evasive to allow them to get to the front quickly and attack with their powerful Balefire Cannon with D3+1 shots. They also give other Cohort units in their battlegroup Fleet, which lets them spend 1 focus point to add 2 speed that turn. Their feat also gives nearby friendly units +3 armor, allowing you to set up a gunline in the face of the enemy and hamper the power of their return fire. Vargus is backed up by Lieutenant Barron, who, once per turn, can use their Battle Plan ability to give a friendly model a bonus from a choice of 3, like Sneak, which gives a nearby unit with concealment, stealth.</p>

<p>The box comes with 3 units, 2 units of 5 Rangers, and a unit of 3 Gun Mages. The Gun Mages can deploy further forward than normal at the start of the game, and come armed with Magelock Pistols, which can fire 3 different types of ammo, giving them either +3 range, an additional dice on attack (then discarding the lowest), or an Electro Leap, which can damage another enemy nearby to their target. The Rangers come in units of 5, and each has 3 heavy rifles and 2 machine gun-armed Rangers. The Rangers can dig in to give their unit concealment and combine their attacks for brutal strikes against resistant enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-3.jpg?itok=fRety-eZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-3.jpg?itok=a7KUfxRb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Heavy Machine Gun Crew from the the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Core Expansion can really hammer down on your opponents units.</figcaption></figure><p>The box also includes a Heavy Machine Gun Crew, who can forward deploy and always have cover due to their reinforcement rule. They can make a free attack once per turn if an enemy comes within 8 inches, and their weapon's tracer round attack ignores stealth, and lights up enemies,s making them easier for your other units to hit. A Trollkin Express Sniper is also included and can only be attached to a Ranger unit. The Trollkin ignores concealment and cover when making attacks, and when targeting warjacks, they can pick the damage column when they hit. They also give the unit their attached to a once per game&nbsp;Cautious Advance ability, where the unit makes a full advance, digs in, and then performs combat actions.</p>

<p>The box completes with airdrop units and has 2 of the 3 Heavy Airdrop warjacks (with the third, the Raider, in the Auxiliary Expansion), and the Light Airdrop Manlet. These units can arrive as part of the Heavy and Light Airdrop command cards, and appear 1 inch away from the unit playing the command card. The warjacks in this set can come in under the control of Vargus (who doesn't have a Warjack in this set, but can use one from other sets), or under the control of Stella, the Rangers, or Gun Mages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-4.jpg?itok=wuRHM26G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-4.jpg?itok=xUiv-mhu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion offers some specialized units to your force and rounds off the airrop command card options.</figcaption></figure><h2>Warmachine Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set, like the Core Expansion detailed above, can be used by itself with some choices out of the box or combined with the Command Starter (or any other Gravedigger set). This expansion adds more specialized units and completes the options for the Light and Heavy airdrop command cards (if you've picked up with Command, Battlegroup, and Core sets, you will have all of the airdrop options).</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Colonel Allison Jakes (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Commandos (Unit)</li>
	<li>Commando Officer (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Captain Argo Brock (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Beaker (Character Heavy Warjack)</li>
	<li>Raider (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Fuel Canister (Light Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>The Auxiliary Expansion Set is commanded by Colonel Jakes, the highest-ranking Gravedigger available. Jakes likes to synergize with multiple units, using abilities like Butcher's Bill, which allows you to advance 3 inches and attack with a nearby unit, if one of your units was damaged that turn. This combines with the Synergy spell, which provides a cumulative bonus (capping at +3) on melee attacks and melee damage to each subsequent model hitting a unit. Backing up Jakes is the warjack Breaker, with an empowered arc node, which reduces the cost of spells channeled through it by one. Breaker is extremely durable, removing an additional damage when the repair action is used on it, along with the ability to spend a focus point once per turn to remove D3 damage, further boosted by being resistant to corrosion, electricity, and fire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-5_0.jpg?itok=v_mGOoZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-5_0.jpg?itok=9JI42k0i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Commandos from the&nbsp;The <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion can punish enemy troops and cover themselves with smoke to avoid return fire.</figcaption></figure><p>The included solo is Captain Argo Brock, who once per turn can boost a nearby unit's next melee attack by +2 damage, or stand up all knocked-down friendly units within 10 inches. Their rate of fire D3 chain gun is effective against medium and large models, and they can draw fire from nearby friendly units with their Shield Guard ability. The Commandos in this set are a unit of 3 Grunts and 2 Support Troopers, and also come with the Command Attached, Commando Officer. As you would imagine, the Commandos can forward deploy, and they can also deploy in any of our control phases after the first turn with their Ambush ability. When attacking, if they hit and fail to damage, they always deal 1 damage, and they can drop a smoke template as an action to avoid return fire. If the unit has the Officer attached, they get access to the Mission Objective ability once per game, which gives all members of this unit +2 to hit and damage a chosen unit for the rest of the turn.</p>

<p>The Auxiliary Expansion closes with a Raider warjack, that is the third type that can be deployed using the Heavy Airdrop command card (along with the Blocker and Skirmisher from the Core Expansion) and the Fuel Canister from the Light Airdrop command card, which can be deployed instead of the other Light Airdrop options from the other Gravedigger sets.</p>

<h2>Warmachine Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansion Sets Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>If you're just starting out in your <em>Warmachine</em>&nbsp;or Gravediggers journey, then I do encourage you to start with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which gives a solid impression of the faction and a good core for starting out. After that, adding in either the Battlegroup Box for extra warjacks, or the Core or Auxiliary Expansion sets adds some real flair for what the faction can do. The Core Expansion Set adds a lot of unit options, empowering your gunline, whereas the Auxiliary Expansion adds some synergies with Jakes and the sneaky options of the Commandos. If you are serious about the Gravediggers, then you will want to purchase all 4 boxes, which will give you access to everything currently released for the Gravediggers (except the massive Boom Boom McCoy warcaster), which will give you a lot of army creation options, especially for your light and heavy airdrops.</p>

<p>The standout units from the Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansions Set for me are the Commandos and Rangers. I love how they capture the airborne nature of the real-world units, but beyond that, the Rangers Trollkin Express Sniper is a lot of fun (for you, not your opponent).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has announced a new strategic partnership. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently rebranded</a> tabletop publisher has signed a deal with Maestro Media, which will provide the company with extensive tabletop game distribution in English-speaking territories.</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Maestro Media Distribution Agreement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Maestro Media has agreed to an exclusive distribution partnership with Asmodee. Under this agreement, effective immediately, Asmodee will be the exclusive distributor of all English-language versions of Maestro Media's products across the United States, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maestro-media-the-binding-of-isaac-four-souls-box-artwork.jpg?itok=KtzkvfT5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maestro-media-the-binding-of-isaac-four-souls-box-artwork.jpg?itok=9eYsCUj6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This distribution is in keeping with Asmodee's renewed company strategy. As part of their new "Inspired by Players" label, the tabletop giant is pushing forward with bringing high-quality tabletop games to players worldwide. It's an apt label considering their recent announcements of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan Sixth Edition</em></a> and the acquisition of the co-op zombie franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a> from CMON.</p>

<p>This strategy aligns with Maestro Media's recent activities. The company, founded in 2015, has earned a reputation of bringing various established IPs into the tabletop space.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of 2025, despite it still feeling a smidge like it's in early access. The choice to transform the fantasy of playing football (soccer for the American folks!) from the traditionally tactical experience seen in most other football games into more of a high-action, mechanically complex throwdown with an emphasis on pulling off acrobatic plays and heroic saves is very cool. It's led to incredibly rewarding moments and crushing defeats, and riding the wave of those two extremes is a big reason why I enjoy games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>. It's also why I love Blue Lock, a manga/anime often cited in comparison to Rematch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did see A LOT of players referencing Blue Lock, more than we expected, actually!" Rematch creative director Pierre Tarno told me via email. "We didn't really know it was so popular--it wasn't a major inspiration for the game, though internally some of us do enjoy both manga and anime!"</p><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Blue Lock is about 300 Japanese high school football players getting locked away in a black site training facility overseen by the mysterious mastermind Jinpachi Ego. Ego tells the group they'll be put through a series of trials, all in hopes of honing one of them into the world's best striker--someone so egotistical that they'd sacrifice Japan's irresponsible emphasis on teamwork to selfishly score goals no matter what and lead the Japan national team to victory. The other 299 failures will never be allowed to play on any Japan team again, ending their football careers in the country.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621"></a><figcaption>When Rematch was first announced, I remember immediately thinking it looked like Blue Lock.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A lot (and I do mean, <em>a lot</em>) of what you can do in Rematch is similar to what characters do in Blue Lock (who themselves are written to emulate the flashiest, most well-remembered traits of famous football players, turned up to 11). Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGDAX9Qty4E">Meguru Bachira</a>, you can master dribbling and fast step-overs to cut through the defense single-handed, only passing the ball to teammates who challenge your imagination of what you can do. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW1jQQkZU9I">Seishirō Nagi</a>, you can pull off skillful ball takedowns and utilize misdirection, ball control, and acrobatic flair to become a goal-scoring genius. And like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6RXxjPpts">Shōei Barō</a>, you can intercept passes meant for teammates (or outright take the ball from them while they're trying to dribble), scoring the goal yourself to steal the show as the match's heel. The opening cinematic of Rematch might highlight the opposite values, but the <em>mechanics </em>of the game allow you to play with ego.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the rules and setting of Rematch emulate Blue Lock--one of the earliest (and fan-favorite) arcs focuses on 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 match-ups where every player is trying to score, there are no off-sides, and the high-tech facility that all the players are contained in verges on futuristic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622"></a><figcaption>Pass? When the goal is right there? I don't think so.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A quick search for "Rematch Blue Lock" will reveal a ton of clips on TikTok and YouTube of people emulating the manga/anime by doing something really cool solo and not passing the ball to their teammates, even when the entire defense collapses upon them. And I can't count the number of times I've been up against or playing alongside someone who has used the character creator to make their player incredibly pale-skinned with short, stark-white hair and a black uniform sporting number 11 (like Nagi), or to give their tan-skinned player dark, medium-length hair with dyed yellow tips and a blue uniform with number 8 (like Bachira).</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, not every person playing Rematch is doing so because they like Blue Lock. I'm sure most of them are like Richard Wakeling, who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rematch-review-unbelievable-tekkers/1900-6418378/">reviewed Rematch for GameSpot</a>, and came to Rematch because they loved playing the sport in real life (or are just fans of Sloclap's work!). But there is clearly a not-insignificant portion of the playerbase that is jumping into Rematch to embrace their egotistical Blue Lock fantasies and play the hero of the match who scores all the cool goals or pulls off clip-worthy dribbling.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623"></a><figcaption>A lot of people in Rematch think they're Nagi.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite all those clear parallels, Rematch is not developer Sloclap's attempt to emulate Blue Lock. It's not the team's attempt to emulate really any singular story centered around football.</p><p dir="ltr">"The setting and art direction really came from the pillars of the game, rather than from specific pieces of media," Tarno said. "Rematch is a game about the joy of playing football with your friends, about how individual talent is necessary but never sufficient, and at the end of the day, it’s the collective that matters. The focus on teamplay and positive sportsmanship is what drove our choices on setting and art direction: a colorful, positive vision of the future."</p><p dir="ltr">Sloclap is hoping Rematch has a positive future itself, and the team is already working on updates to the game beyond the soon-to-come cross-play.</p><p dir="ltr">"Emergent strategies and mechanics started appearing [during the beta], but they consolidated during launch week," Tarno said. "Most of them are valid and should not be removed, but one exploit we'll be removing is the 'dolphin jump,' in which players exploit the outfield dive to move faster even when they've run out of stamina. We're considering advanced ways that could be used to optimize movement speed and stamina usage, but this one looks really weird and will be removed!"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624"></a><figcaption>The goalkeeper deserves more options to stop the multitude of shots that strikers can take.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much like other online multiplayer games that came before it, Rematch is evolving as more players jump in, and Sloclap has noted that its vision of Rematch may change to match players' expectations. That probably doesn't mean a Blue Lock crossover is coming (but we live in a post-Fortnite world, so who knows), but other aspects of the game are changing to reflect a shift in focus--such as the way 5v5 has ceased to be the "standard" mode, despite Sloclap setting it up to be the default way to play ranked matches.</p><p dir="ltr">"The initial vision we had for the game was a 5v5 experience, which features more tactical configurations, more challenge in making precise passes, and [more development of] your vision of the game dynamics," Tarno said. "The 3v3 game mode is very popular, however, and we're seeing a lot of players requesting a 3v3 ranked queue, so it's really a matter of taste for players."</p><p dir="ltr">On that, I agree with the herd. I know Sloclap wants 5v5 to be the experience for Rematch, but the game feels a lot more tactical and strategic when played on the tighter 3v3 and 4v4 fields, and it's easier for the player who's keeper/sweeper to call out the action, stay engaged, and feel useful on the smaller field.</p><p>Maybe just give the keeper the ability to pull off a last-ditch shachihoko fish kick to save the ball like Blue Lock's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GmwocGtH14">Gin Gagamaru</a>? That would be cool!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The third-person PvPvE dungeon crawler RPG Dungeon Stalkers is now hosting its final beta test ahead of its launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468730/Dungeon_Stalkers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. Interested fans can simply join the playtest by requesting access via the store page.</p>
<p>This final beta, which will close on Tuesday, July 1st at 6:59 PM Pacific Time, includes the following improvements over previous test phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>New stalkers Liyan and Shinobu added (total 9 stalkers available)</li>
<li>Light extraction rule (no item loss upon death) implemented for quick match and PvE mode</li>
<li>New rune system that allows stalker growth</li>
<li>New Camp system that allows item crafting and upgrade</li>
<li>Stalker ultimates have been improved</li>
<li>Running is now available for a more enjoyable game experience</li>
<li>Kill camera and report system added</li>
</ul>
<p>In Dungeon Stalkers, players choose one of the nine playable characters, each with their own story, personality, and skills, and descend into the Witch's cursed dungeon. They can enter alone or with trusted companions in teams of up to three. As they explore, gather loot, and fight off corrupted monsters and rival Stalkers, their ultimate goal is to escape alive. But no two runs are alike due to the Witch's Curse system, which alters the dungeon conditions dynamically with each session, changing the odds and the challenges.</p>
<p>As characters take damage, this is visually represented by degraded armor, which enemy players can spot, adding tension and strategic depth as well as influencing how and when players engage in PvP combat. Two modes are available: a more casual PvE experience focused on fun or a hardcore, competitive PvPvE dungeon run.</p>

                <p>After getting hit with a delay that bumped its launch out of 2024, Little Nightmares 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-launches-in-october-preorders-come-with-remaster-of-original-game/1100-6532696/" data-ref-id="1100-6532696">finally has an official release date</a>: October 10. The standard edition has been available to preorder since 2023, but now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3,B0FDTN2KQS,B0FDR7G47V,B0FDR9641P,B0FDR8H4LN,B0CGCBSQ3Q,B0CGCHWKH1,B0CGCR6BVZ&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans have four editions to choose from</a>, including the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon-exclusive Mirror Edition</a></strong>. The $110 edition of Little Nightmares 3 is bound to be a popular pick, as it comes with an assortment of collectibles that are likely to appeal to franchise's dedicated fanbase. Amazon-exclusive editions of games tend to be hot commodities in general, and this one looks pretty awesome and reasonably priced. Little Nightmares 3 will be available on Switch 2, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC at launch.</p><p>Physical editions are only available in the US on Switch 2, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X. That said, Little Nightmares 3 has a compelling preorder promotion that's only available to those who buy the digital edition.</p><hr><h2>Little Nightmares 3 Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>If you preorder a digital copy of Little Nightmares 3 for PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, you’ll get instant early access to Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition ahead of its October release. This offer isn't available on Switch or Switch 2. PS4 and Xbox One players can take advantage of this offer, but since the Enhanced Edition is only available on current-gen consoles, you won't be able to play it until you upgrade to PS5 or Series X|S. </p><p>It's worth noting that you won't necessarily miss out on the free Enhanced Edition if you preorder a physical copy. Bandai Namco is offering the Enhanced Edition as a free upgrade to owners of the original when it launches alongside Little Nightmares 3 on October 10. So you'll be missing out on early access, not the game itself.</p><p>All physical and digital edition preorders come with the Dark Six Costumes Set to customize the appearance of the game's two protagonists.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521433-littlenightmares3mirroredition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521433" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521433-littlenightmares3mirroredition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521433"></a><figcaption>Little Nightmares 3: Mirror Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521433-littlenightmares3mirroredition.jpg"></figure><div title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3749" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Little Nightmares 3 Mirror Edition | Amazon Exclusive</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$110 | Releases October 10</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon-exclusive Mirror Edition</a> costs $110 and includes all of the digital content found in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDTN2KQS,B0FDR7G47V,B0FDR9641P,B0FDR8H4LN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 Deluxe Edition</a> as well as a handful of collectibles.

She also finds a quirky yet brilliant sidekick to sheepishly help her optimize her Ironheart suit, with an interesting twist. After meeting McGillicuddy (Alden Ehrenreich) and visiting his shady bunker full of black market weapons, Riri gets him to confess that his name is actually Ezekiel Stane. And he has a Ziploc bag full of the ashes of Obadiah Stane—his father!</p><p>Those who have been MCU fans since it began with the first <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404"><em>Iron Man</em> movie</a></span> in 2008 will remember Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) as the ruthless Stark Industries executive who orchestrated Tony’s kidnapping in Afghanistan and horrifyingly pulled the arc reactor out of the Stark Industries founder’s chest. In the show, Ezekiel says he is 36 years old, which would make him roughly 17 when his father was killed by Iron Man. That’s still young enough for him to have developed the sort of trauma that’ll turn someone into the type to hoard weapons of mass destruction as a “hobby.”</p><p>Interestingly enough, Ezekiel tells Riri that he and his father weren’t close (hence the Ziploc bag urn) and references his father’s nefarious Iron Monger alter ego. However, in <em>Iron Man</em>, it’s never publicly revealed that Obadiah was the Iron Monger, which could suggest Ezekiel either had intimate knowledge of his father’s crimes from being involved, or that he was told about them later in life. Either way, <em>Ironheart </em>adds a cool expansion to the MCU history books—without making that the central appeal of an already great show. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ironheart-iron-man-obidiah-stane-ezekiel-stane-disney-1851785091]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Like the first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has several Easter eggs waiting to be discovered, and one of the best is tied to your birthday. If you happen to be celebrating another spin around the sun, the game will pick up on this and the next time you decide to take a break, you'll be greeted with a heartwarming scene that features the main cast. Just don't get too excited about the birthday cake, as it's about to suffer a terrible fate in this short celebration.

Sure, they're playing characters inside of a video game, but it still <em>technically</em> counts. It shouldn't be too surprising to see an Easter egg like this in Death Stranding 2, and with the game out this week, players will likely be unearthing a few more secrets in the weeks to come.</p><p>Death Stranding had its fair share of them, with some of the highlights being references to game director Hideo Kojima's work on the Metal Gear Solid series, nods to classic literature, and plenty of cameos.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157011/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>No matter how much I learn about the workings of computers, it will always be Tron in there. Little programs, running around on the Grid, trying to keep the whole system from falling apart. So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a> felt right up my street. It does a great job of visually replicating that digital world and there is a great idea at its core. Unfortunately, the gameplay didn’t quite live up to the premise. By the end, I was left feeling like the program needed more time to compile.</p>
<p>Tron: Catalyst starts strong – we are introduced to a courier program named Exo who, due to a package exploding in her hands, begins glitching. Her glitches cause her to relive loops of time over and over, a power she uses to escape from prison and uncover a conspiracy surrounding the approaching reset of the Grid. There are competing factions trying to preserve or destroy the Grid; Core seeks to control the Grid with brute force while Automata seek to impart free will to all programs.</p>
<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157008/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a great set up and it immediately got me hooked on the story Tron: Catalyst was telling, with perhaps the best implementation of time travel mechanics I’ve seen (and you’re talking to a guy with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> tattoo), with Exo able to relive loops over and over to get the right outcome. It isn’t just a case of “you ran out of hit points so you restart the loop” either – there are points where it is necessary to restart a loop of your own free will to get a new outcome after you’ve gotten new information.</p>
<p>There are some fun characters to interact with throughout. Most have voice acting and their cutscenes play out through static images with text beneath them. It all feels a bit basic and some of the dialogue is a bit stiff, but it does the job of moving the plot forward. In the second half of the game, when the timeline opens up and you can do more to manipulate outcomes to your advantage, you get to not just interact with these people but truly help them, which is where Tron: Catalyst finally comes to life. Because they let me get to know everyone in the first half of the game, I was extra motivated to help them when I finally got the chance.</p>
<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157015/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem comes down to the gameplay. Unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_identity">Tron: Identity</a>, Catalyst is a top-down isometric action game, so you’ll spend a lot of time fighting other programs to get where you need to go. Combat is relatively tame. You can attack, block, or dodge. Eventually, you get the ability to replicate the code of other programs, which can give you stronger attacks or greater speed. It isn’t exactly necessary – you can get through the whole game just by hitting everything in your base form – so it doesn't really inject much depth into an already shallow system.</p>
<p>Combat is never terribly difficult, but it becomes significantly easier once you unlock the ability to inflict massive damage on a parry, to the point where even some bosses go down in one hit. The rest of the skill tree feels unnecessary once you’ve powered up your parry ability. It feels unbalanced and highlights my biggest complaint about the game – outside of the story, everything feels unfinished and half-baked. You really shouldn’t be able to hit one button to win most fights.</p>
<p>This is especially true of the vehicle sections in Tron: Catalyst. Early on you get access to a light cycle, the iconic vehicle from the <strong>Tron</strong> films. This should have been a highlight, but it never handles well. It floats in a way that doesn’t make sense, especially given that light cycles in the films travel in straight lines and handle with sharp, 90-degree turns. It is even worse during the light jet segment, where the controls will suddenly reverse if you turn too far in one direction. This part of the game was the one that took me the most time to finish. It left me shouting in frustration. This is Tron, after all. I should be <em>loving</em> the light cycle, not dreading every time I load it up.</p>
<figure><a title="TRON: Catalyst Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157013/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, I found myself unimpressed with Tron: Catalyst. Even with the bright neon lights replicating the feel of the original Tron movie, there were points where the visuals were too dark to see where I was going, causing me to get stuck behind walls or by stairs. The problem was worse in handheld mode, but it didn’t happen enough to be anything other than a minor annoyance. Just another example where Tron: Catalyst felt unpolished. The true sin the developers committed was not letting me adjust the camera angle. It gave the game a static feeling that I wanted to rebel against.</p>
<p>So, the combat is lackluster and the vehicle portions just feel wrong. Yet, I can’t bring myself to pan this game completely. This is a case of a developer not finding the right genre for the game they want to make. If Tron: Catalyst had been a visual novel with the ability to flip between chapters as you restart loops, it could have been great because there is greatness in here. The narrative is good and the time-travel concept is honestly one of the best I’ve seen, but neither gets the chance to shine. Instead, they are wrapped up in a shallow combat system, frustrating vehicle sections, and bland visuals.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tron: Catalyst isn’t a terrible game, but it is definitely in the wrong genre. Its engaging setting and excellent time-travel mechanics carried me far beyond the point where I got bored of the shallow combat system and frustrating vehicle sections. Despite the visuals and story feeling very Tron, it doesn’t capture the same feel of the movies. Honestly, if you can’t make a light cycle fun to ride, you have no place making a Tron game.</p></section>

Just completing hunts can provide more than you need. If they don’t, selling Trade-In Materials will yield a hell of a boost in funds.

Everything from ores and ingredients to weapons and armor can be traded for Zenny.</p><p>While there are certainly a lot of options, <strong>I would prioritize selling any low-rank armor you made and ingredients that you have a ridiculous amount of</strong>. Weapons can always be upgraded to higher rarities. Special items and materials you forage can be given to Item Traders for other rare assets. Even monster parts can be used to smelt ores if you don’t have any applicable weapons or armors to forge. Remember not to sell everything just because you can–plenty of stuff has other uses with the many mechanics of this game!</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zenny-trade-in-material-1851785064]]></content:encoded>

In print, readers will spot their presence in playful author blurbs tucked inside volumes or the prefaces of their new chapters in weekly magazines like <em>Shonen Jump</em>, where artists like Eiichiro Oda write bite-sized anecdotes about their week, accompanied by a quirky caricature of themselves. However, when the spotlight of their work demands more exposure—be it a fan event or a press interview tied to their anime—many mangaka go to impressive lengths to conceal their faces.</p><p>Contrary to the fame-forward culture of Western “auteurs,” where directors gladly bask in the limelight during press tours, many mangaka choose to keep a low profile for a simple reason: they like their privacy. Between <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jujutsu-kaisen-leaks-271-manga-spoiler-culture-2000503868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic fandom backlash</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/racists-are-trying-to-make-dan-da-dan-the-latest-front-in-their-culture-war-2000536054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culture war dogpiling</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-thousand-death-threats-against-a-popular-anime-creato-631792221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online threats over creative choices</a>, and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-09/woman-arrested-for-threatening-one-piece-creator-oda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death threats</a>, keeping their face out of public view isn’t vanity, it’s protection. When the industry already <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blurs the line between work life and private life</a>, that boundary becomes essential.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ChnkvDUQqv4?feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s also amusing</a> when a creator like <em>Nier: Automata</em> director Yoko Taro’s career, which has leaned into anonymity, leads to improvising a new disguise after he <a href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-mask-nier-automata-emil-lost-anime-expo-2023-1850603039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost his titular mask at Anime Expo 2023</a>. Who doesn’t love a good disguise? In the spirit of that, here’s my top five favorite mangaka disguises. Honorable mention goes to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/witch-hat-ateliers-creator-shares-her-inspirations-and-aspirations-for-its-anime-2000514254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Witch Hat Atelier</em> creator Kamome Shirahama</a>, who, during a virtual interview for her anime adaptation, sent over a headshot so absurdly charming it had me doubled over laughing.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kamome Shirahama/KODANSHA/ Witch Hat Atelier Committee</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Dandadan’s Yukinobu Tatsu</h2><p>As a creator who got his start as an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-mans-influence-can-already-be-felt-beyond-its-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assistant to mangaka like <em>Chainsaw Man</em> creator Tatsuki Fujimoto’s <em>Fire Punch</em></a> and fellow assistant <a href="https://kotaku.com/hell-s-paradise-manga-shonen-jump-seinen-yuji-kaku-horr-1848618482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuji Kaku’s <em>Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku</em></a>, <a href="https://dandadan.fandom.com/wiki/Yukinobu_Tatsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yukinobu Tatsu</a>’s series <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dandadan</em></a> quickly strapped a rocket to his back, propelling him into the mainstream. Instead of opting for one of his characters to digitally stand in for himself, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rr_asBvOB8&amp;t=1667s&amp;pp=0gcJCdAJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujimoto does with Pochita</a>, Tatsu’s disguise is both puzzling and provocative. It’s just a mask with eggs and sausages on its face. I’ve no clue what compelled him to make a <em>Purge</em>-adjacent breakfast mask his visage, but I can’t fault him for choosing a disguise that gets me in the mood for a Denny’s Grand Slam whenever I see him make a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vizmedia/video/7426415811906112811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video appearance to promote <em>Dandadan</em>’s anime</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fullmetal Alchemist’s Hiromu Arakawa</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Interview with Hiromu Arakawa, author of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (2017) [EngSub]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2z9RqAtAM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiromu_Arakawa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hiromu Arakawa</a> is, without exaggeration, one of the greatest mangaka to ever do it. She’s the mind behind <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>, a series whose anime adaptation is often considered the gold standard thanks to its tight plotting, emotionally resonant characters (especially its women), sharp political themes, and side-splitting moments of levity. Despite being a goat, Arakawa, ever the unapologetic farm girl, fully leans into her roots in the most charming way possible: disguising herself as a bespectacled cow. Whether it’s her author’s headshot or her face superimposed in video interviews, she always appears as a bookish bovine. It’s funny, it’s adorable, and it makes her long-running milk agenda in <em>FMA</em>—where she insists Ed could’ve outgrown his short king phase with a proper calcium intake—all the more iconic.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gege Akutami&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="【公式】漫道コバヤシ#74 漫画大賞2020グランプリ 芥見下々『呪術廻戦』-蒼-" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoE6ptLsfaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before the <a href="https://aftermath.site/jujutsu-kaisen-magneto-xavier-gojo-geto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a> fandom went full nutso mode over how the story wrapped up—raging about character deaths, narrative choices, and backseat quarterbacking over how they would’ve written it—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gege_Akutami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gege Akutami</a> was already well acquainted with the dark side of success. Few modern mangaka have endured the level of fan backlash Akutami has, all for creating one of today’s most popular shonen series.&nbsp;</p><p>Long before the firestorm, though, Akutami leaned into anonymity early in the most on-brand way possible: showing up to interviews in full <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Kokichi_Muta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mechamaru</a> cosplay. Akutami’s disguise isn’t just clever, it’s a perfect meta nod. The cyborg character remotely operates the automaton from the safe refuge of his hidden base. Not even his allies know what his real face looks like. Akutami also gets bonus points for his commitment to the disguise. That papier-mache mech head looks sweaty and uncomfortable to sit in for any period of time.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Apothecary Diaries’ Natsu Hyuga&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Apothecary Diaries Special - ANIME MANGA EXPLOSION _ NHK WORLD-JAPAN_1_RESOLUTION" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uxG4DmJq_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Like Akutami, <a href="https://aftermath.site/apothecary-diaries-frog-scene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Apothecary Diaries</em></a> light novel author<a href="https://kusuriya.fandom.com/wiki/Natsu_Hy%C5%ABga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Natsu Hyuga</a> takes a full-body approach to her public appearance disguise. Instead of taking on the appearance of one of her characters, Hyuga’s disguise goes the route of an anthropomorphic mascot with Uririn, a wild boar piglet who waddles around whenever she’s making a public appearance. Though judging by her social media, her disguise might as well be how she walks through life, because her Twitter account is <a href="https://x.com/NaMelanza/status/1923319036324008173/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">littered with candid images of her in disguise</a> lounging on sofas, <a href="https://x.com/NaMelanza/status/1913236149583372422/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imbibing</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/NaMelanza/status/1894446566876090590/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Beastars’ Paru Itagaki</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Paru Itagaki Interview [OTAQUEST CONNECT]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wD_D2CrHG0o?start=130&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Just when you think being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/d69ch8/keisuke_itagaki_creator_of_grappler_baki_paru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the daughter of <em>Baki The Grappler</em> author Keisuke Itagaki</a> couldn’t make you any cooler, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/beastars-caps-off-netflixs-fall-anime-season-in-spectacular-fashion-2000535938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beastars</em></a><em> </em>creator Paru Itagaki ups the ante with a chicken head.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/july-2025%E2%80%99s-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-diablo-4-as-ps-plus-celebrates-15th-anniversary.1228248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for July 2025, as well as detailing some of what will happen to mark and celebrate the 15th anniversary of the subscription service, which launched in a very different guise all the way back in 2010.</p>
<p>Let’s not mess about, though. PS Plus this month includes Diablo 4, and two other games, which are…</p>


<p><span>What are the PS Plus July 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>
<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Jusant</strong> | PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/"><strong>Diablo IV</strong></a> is the headline act here, with Blizzard’s latest action RPG title looking to completely overhaul how it taps into online features, building more of a live game to compliment the moreish loot hunting. There’s been a bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/03/diablo-iv-season-of-loot-reborn-review/">seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/">expansion</a> content added to the game since launch in 2023, but at the time Gamoc said, “Diablo IV is almost shockingly refined, with an absorbing story and addictive gameplay. The shift to always online and connected play might turn some away, and the level scaling can make combat a little same-y, but on the whole, this is still Diablo at its best. It plays very well, offers tonnes of options for tailoring your character and acquiring that all important hunt for better and better loot will keep you coming back for more.”</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/15/king-of-fighters-xv-15-review/"><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong></a> revived the long-running fighting game series, back in 2022. SNK’s storied series had gone pretty quiet through the previous decade, but came back with a hefty punch. Dom said in our review, “King of Fighters XV marks an excellent return for the series, modernising it at nearly every turn. While we await a story that’ll finally do justice to the characterful roster, it stakes a claim to SNK’s past with an eye firmly on the future.”</p>

<p>Alas, we have no review of Jusant to draw upon, but Don’t Nod’s climbing game was certainly fascinating to see developed and released. It’s both an action-puzzle climbing game where you try to clamber up the side of a huge tower, but it’s also a meditative journey because of this, with secrets from a lost civilisation to uncover.</p>
<h2>What’s happening for the PS Plus 15th Anniversary?</h2>
<p>Sony has pulled together a bunch of new game trials for PS Plus Premium members, some special offers, exclusive Valorant content, and PS Tournaments. Oh, and a free weekend!</p>

			<p>The FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/06/ftc-sends-126-million-refunds-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items-reopens-claims?utm_source=govdelivery">announced today</a> that it will send refunds to players who made unwanted purchases in Fortnite, with the refunds totaling over $126 million. The agency will also reopen the process for players and their parents or guardians to make claims for further compensation from now until <strong>July 9, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This latest batch of refunds is a follow-up from the 629,344 refunds issued in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-users-refunds-are-being-issued-by-the-ftc-following-settlement-of-fortnite-case/">December 2024</a> over what the FTC described as "<em>deceptive</em>" practices from Epic that led to players making unwanted purchases in the first place.</p>
<p>While the agency disclosed the average refund amount in December to be $114 per person, it does not disclose what the average refund will be this time around, perhaps due to the fact that there's still time for people to submit claims. Beginning today, however, either through PayPal or a check, the FTC will begin delivering <strong>969,173</strong> refunds.</p>
<p>If you selected to receive a check on your claim form, the FTC recommends you cash it within 90 days. PayPal recipients should redeem their refund within 30 days.</p>
<p>Including today's batch of refunds, the FTC has now provided players with more than <strong>$200 million</strong> as part of the FTC's punitive action against Epic Games.</p>
<p>This claims process began in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-announces-claims-process-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items">September 2023</a> and is part of the $245 million Epic was fined for its practices regarding microtransactions in Fortnite. The first claims process lasted from September 2023 to January 2024, though if you missed that window, you now have an extra two weeks to get your cut of the refunds from Epic Games.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/691964/remedy-entertainment-profile-alan-wake-control-fbc-firebreak</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-is-in-control.1228242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In the quiet city of Espoo, a short drive west from Helsinki in Finland, is an unassuming building that’s home to one of the most confounding studios in games. Remedy Entertainment is known for getting <em>weird</em>. It started with the meta horror of <em>Alan Wake</em>, and has since expanded with <em>Control</em>, a game that turns a bureaucratic government office into a sinister and unsettling battleground. Their worlds merge the surreal and the mundane — which is not a bad description of Remedy itself. </p><p>On the day I visited, the studio’s energy was relaxed and subdued — in true Finnish style, there are even multiple onsite saunas — and frankly a little boring, especially for a creative team known for the likes of the mind-bending <a href="https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ashtray_Maze">Ashtray Maze</a> or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxs_HYw_mLk">Old Gods of Asgard</a>” musical. But that contrast is also one of the keys to Remedy’s recent success.</p><p>In the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, the video game industry has experienced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">studio closures</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">persistent layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/685322/how-ea-killed-the-dragon-age">corporate meddling</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">ill-fated games that were canceled soon after launch</a>. Exceptions like Remedy have been rare. Over the past decade, the studio has been implementing a plan to help it compete with bigger, better-funded developers and publishers, steadily inching its way from a work-for-hire studio to one in charge of its own destiny. As the industry has shifted toward live-service hits like <em>Fortnite</em> and blockbusters like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, Remedy has taken big swings with ambitious and delightfully strange narrative titles.</p><p>Now it’s trying to expand even further with its first multiplayer — and self-published — game in <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. The stakes are high: it’s the perfect example of Remedy’s new way of working and a proof of concept for its larger, more expansive future. It’s also a strange experience, marrying the surreal tone of <em>Control</em> with co-op play that bucks the latest online gaming trends. But to hear it from the Finnish developer, it only gets to take swings like <em>Firebreak</em> because it nailed all of the boring stuff first.</p><p>“We are this building,” explains creative director Mikael Kasurinen. “This is it; this is us. We aren’t owned by anybody else, and I think that realization brings that culture of taking more responsibility. There is nothing above us that will save the day if things go wrong. It’s all on us.”</p><p>This wasn’t the case for much of the studio’s existence. Founded in 1995, Remedy’s first release was a combat racing game called <em>Death Rally</em>. A few years later, the studio garnered widespread acclaim with 2001’s <em>Max Payne</em>, a hard-boiled noir with action ripped out of a John Woo movie. After a sequel, Remedy expanded in new directions with the survival horror game <em>Alan Wake</em> and sci-fi game / TV show hybrid <em>Quantum Break</em>.</p><p>Despite its modest success, though, the studio found itself stuck in a cycle of working from game to game. It didn’t own any of its creations — instead, they were the property of publishers like Rockstar and Microsoft — and, with the exception of the rapid 18-month development of <em>Max Payne 2</em>, Remedy was only putting out new games every five years or so. That half-decade cycle meant that if any game failed, so did the company.</p><p>This put Remedy in a precarious position, and it’s something Tero Virtala realized right away when he took over as CEO in 2016. “At that point Remedy had been around for 20 years, and succeeded in relation to many criteria,” Virtala says. That included releasing several hit games and steadily growing in headcount. But Virtala says that “it didn’t feel like enough” to have such a talented team and only release one game every four or five years. While it’s typical for games to take years to build, only having one project at a time left the studio vulnerable in case any of them flopped.</p><p>Virtala helped spearhead a new path for Remedy’s future built on two pillars: One was becoming a multi-project studio, so that it was less dependent on any single game. Second, Remedy also wanted ownership of its original creations and to eventually become its own publisher.</p><div><p>“It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it.”</p></div><p>A major part of making this work was ensuring that everyone in the studio bought in and understood the plan, not just management. It sounds like a controversial idea and runs counter to the way the industry typically works: whereas most studios operate with clear lines dividing creative and business, Virtala believed that empowering developers to understand the business side meant they’d be better able to make the right decisions on the creative end.</p><p>“People are smart,” Virtala says of his employees, “and they are mature enough to understand that if you want to make creative, ambitious games, it’s not possible unless you have the financial basis, unless you are aligned with the technology, unless you have the people and the production plans are in order. We try to provide the teams with as much information as possible. And then the teams are in the best place to try to figure out what is the best creative path within these constraints.”</p><p>And it seems that the creative side has bought in. Sam Lake has been with Remedy for nearly its entire 30-year existence, starting out as a writer on <em>Death Rally</em>. (He’s also the face of the original Max Payne — <a href="https://www.vg247.com/alan-wake-2-director-sam-lake-may-regret-using-likeness-in-max-payne">literally</a>.) He now serves as creative director and is the lead writer behind all of Remedy’s major franchises. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it,” Lake says. “When you’re creating a game concept, there are a lot of decisions being made, and the more you understand about what these decisions affect, the better you are prepared to choose wisely.”</p><p>The real turning point came with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the launch of <em>Control</em> in 2019</a>, the first game released under Virtala’s leadership. While the idea for the story and world had been kicking around in Lake’s head for some time, the actual development happened as Virtala was implementing broader studio changes. He pushed for more efficient processes and timelines, hoping to make games faster without sacrificing the quality level Remedy had become known for.</p><p>“Those three years were transformative for Remedy,” Kasurinen says. He notes that this new development style meant planning much more in advance on <em>Control</em>, and viewing limitations around budgets and timelines as creative challenges “that forced us to reinvent many things in a good way.” When it came out, <em>Control</em> exemplified exactly what the studio wanted to be: it was developed in a comparatively brisk three years, was a brand-new property that the studio would (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085807/remedy-is-now-in-control">eventually</a>) own outright, and was in development alongside another project in collaboration with Korean publisher Smilegate. Creatively, it also allowed the team to attempt a new kind of open-ended action game and it opened up new directions for the future.</p><div><p><em>Control</em>’s success allowed this plan to continue. Since then, Remedy has steadily expanded. <em>Control</em> was followed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">a long-awaited sequel to <em>Alan Wake</em></a>, and the studio has grown to 380 people. It currently has four projects in development: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg">a sequel to <em>Control</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/6/23013920/max-payne-1-2-remakes-remedy-rockstar-take-two">remakes of the <em>Max Payne</em> games</a>, an unannounced title, and its first multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox">the recently launched <em>Control</em> spinoff <em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>. With the exception of <em>Max Payne</em>, which is being published by Rockstar, all of its in-development games are self-published.</p></div><p>Remedy now also <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/07/01/1876391/0/en/REMEDY-ENTERTAINMENT-PLC-Remedy-records-2-5-million-euros-of-one-time-royalty-income-from-previously-released-games.html">holds the publishing rights for <em>Alan Wake</em></a> (the sequel was originally published by Epic Games), and has created its own connected universe, which unites the worlds of <em>Alan Wake</em> and <em>Control</em>. In 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">it partnered with Annapurna Pictures</a> to potentially expand this even further through film and TV adaptations. Branching out into new genres and mediums is a further attempt to grow Remedy’s capabilities — and to better insulate itself from the volatile whims of the games industry.</p><p>Getting to this moment required some structural changes. Remedy now has multiple development teams, with staff shifting between them as needed, and it also has a unique setup with two creative directors in Lake and Kasurinen. Lake says that both of them want to be hands-on when they’re leading a new game, and so having two people in the role allows the creative side to always be involved in larger studio decisions, even in the midst of an intense development process.</p><p>“When I was deep into <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, I wasn’t a part of attending weekly management meetings,” Lake says. “I just needed to focus on [the game]. But it’s really important that we have the creative side represented on the company level. So this arrangement gives us flexibility. We can represent each other.”</p><p>Even still, the transition wasn’t always smooth. As Remedy attempted to grow into a multi-project studio, not all of its expansion attempts worked out. First, the studio partnered with Smilegate on a new iteration of the popular military shooter <em>Crossfire</em>. The idea was that Smilegate would make the multiplayer portion of the game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334562/crossfirex-remedy-trailer-xbox-one-series-x-smilegate-fps">while Remedy would craft a single-player story mode</a>, giving the studio a chance to make its first first-person shooter. But <em>CrossfireX</em> was poorly received upon release in 2022 — campaign mode included — and shut down a year later.</p><div><p>Remedy also attempted to get into the world of free-to-play games through a partnership with Tencent, but the title — known as Project Vanguard — <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-remedy-entertainment-plans-to-reboot-codename-vanguard-to-a-premium-game-with-a-strong-cooperative-multiplayer-component/">eventually shifted to a premium release</a>, before finally being <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-codename-kestrel-cancelled-as-remedy-focuses-on-existing-franchises/">canceled before it was ever shown to the public</a>.</p></div><p>Virtala says that these setbacks were largely a result of pushing too far too fast. And in the case of Vanguard, the failure helped the studio realize that four games at a time was the sweet spot for what the company could manage. “We started to feel that we had a bit too many projects for our size of organization,” he explains. “We saw that if we had a bit more focus, it would help our other projects to succeed.”</p><p>But those failures don’t mean Remedy is done trying new things. In fact, the studio’s first fully self-published game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox"><em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, is also one of its most surprising releases. It’s a multiplayer shooter, which might sound like an odd release from a studio known for single-player narratives. But as the studio looked to expand, multiplayer was one of the key areas the team wanted to explore.</p><div><p>“We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences.”</p></div><p><em>Firebreak</em> is a relative baby step in that direction. It’s connected to a popular game the studio owns, and it was built by a small internal team. While regular updates are planned — <a href="https://x.com/ControlRemedy/status/1932800170850152957">including “major” releases in the fall and winter</a> — <em>Firebreak</em> isn’t a live-service game on par with <em>Fortnite </em>or <em>Call of Duty</em>, designed to keep players coming back with ongoing events and daily activities. It’s a paid game <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/remedy-director-says-that-fbc-firebreak-respects-player-time-instead-of-relying-on-fomo-which-has-infected-modern-games/">meant explicitly to “respect the player’s time.”</a> It’s also a way for the studio to expand its capabilities without stretching the team too far.</p><p>“We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences,” says Mike Kayatta, game director on <em>Firebreak</em>. “I like to think that we know what we’re doing when it comes to these large, single-player story-driven games. This is how the studio built its reputation and what it’s good at. When you’re faced with saying, ‘Hey, we need to diversify the types of experiences we’re making,’ do you really just want to just make five more of these linear, story-driven games?”</p><p>So far, <em>Firebreak</em>’s release hasn’t gone exactly to plan. It was greeted with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam">mixed reviews from critics and players</a>, many of whom complained that, while it maintains some of the weird and unsettling tone as <em>Control</em>, it’s held back by repetitive gameplay and a lack of Remedy-style narrative flourishes. But the studio seems intent on fixing things, recently posting an extensive list of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2272540/announcements/detail/536605349656920273">patch notes</a> and other upcoming changes that cover everything from the onboarding experience to the UI. “Several things have gone well,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2272540/announcements/detail/536605349656920275">the studio wrote</a>. “Clearly, not everything has.”</p><p>The success of a game like <em>Firebreak </em>is still critical for Remedy even under its multi-project structure. It’s a complex plan that has kept Virtala very busy over the last 10 years. In fact, when I spoke to him in an empty conference room at Remedy’s office, he was delayed because he had to prepare for the studio’s most recent financial report the next day. “Every single game is highly important for us,” Virtala says. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated. But we are less dependent on any single game than we used to be.”</p><div><p>This feeling is only strengthened by the current realities of the gaming industry. It’s a space where even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">a well-funded EA studio can’t get a Black Panther game made</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">a Sony-backed multiplayer shooter in development for eight years, <em>Concord</em>, is quickly shuttered</a>, and the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686351/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-twitch-luna-new-world">Amazon</a> are struggling to make headway despite huge investments. Remedy is currently in a good place, with a growing back catalog and multiple games in development, and while it has grown, it’s still a fraction of the size of most other studios making big-budget games, which often have headcounts in the thousands. </p></div><p>While the last decade has been a big shift at Remedy, Lake describes his time at the studio as being filled with constant change, as the company steadily grew in terms of both staff and the scale of its projects. Even still, he believes that the current incarnation of the studio might be ideal for this multi-project structure, and says that he “would be surprised” if Remedy continued to grow significantly over the next few years. While many large studios are seemingly focused on perpetual growth, the team at Remedy is happy to be sustainable.</p><p>“There were a couple of false starts trying to get there, but now it feels very much like we’re settled,” says Lake. “This is what Remedy is now.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/691964/remedy-entertainment-profile-alan-wake-control-fbc-firebreak]]></content:encoded>

A riff on both cooking shows and late night talk show hosts, it’s a bit like foodie’s equivalent of<em> Reading Rainbow </em>presented in a stop-motion style with a Wes Anderson-like sensibility. It educates kids on the basics of how the food they put in their bodies is grown and prepared. Maybe they learn a greater appreciation for cooking. At the very least they aren’t rotting their brains on algorithmic YouTube garbage. </p><p>So like most people, including those who watch <em>Tiny Chef</em>, I stumbled upon its cancellation announcement completely by accident when a now-viral short of the titular character getting the bad news directly from the execs at Nickelodeon popped into one of my social feeds. “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2uQbr3f_-I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2uQbr3f_-I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiny Chef needs your help</a></span>,” reads the title of a YouTube video uploaded on June 24. In it, Tiny Chef is humming to himself and dusting his room when the news gets broken to him that the show is finished. “But I have ideas that will blow your mind,” he adorably lisps into the phone. <br></p><p>Instead of getting angry and blowing up he finally says, “I understand,” and tries to go back to cleaning before breaking down and sitting on his bed with his head in his hands. It’s crushing. “That little attempt to straighten himself out and then get back to what he was doing only to immediately break down...that’s REAL grief right there,” reads one of the top YouTube comments. “I didn’t know about this show until 10 minutes ago,” reads another. “But the depiction of the chef trying to be strong while this clearly gets to him is something I can relate to a lot and that clearly the creators understand very well.”</p><p>“<em>Tiny Chef</em> and the team need your help now more than ever!” reads a call for donations on the show’s website. “Many of you have said that you would die for <em>Tiny Chef</em>, we don’t need all that (!!!) but we do need crowd funding to keep going.” The creators have asked people to subscribe to the YouTube channel as well. It’s unclear at this point if the plan is to keep producing new episodes independently or try to demonstrate enough support so that one of the streaming services orders new episodes. </p><p>The show was created by animator Rachel Larsen, co-creators Adam Reid and Ozlem Akturk, and counts Kristen Bell of <em>Veronica Mars</em> fame as one of its producers and most frequent guest star. It’s the kind of kids’ programming that seems like a perfect fit for Disney or Apple. Brian Grazer and Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment took an equity stake in <em>Tiny Chef</em> back in 2019, so I’m sure it will find its feet. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/tiny-chef-nickelodeon-canceled-season-3-kristen-bell-1851785074]]></content:encoded>

We’ll explore RC’s behind-the-scenes history, discuss everything that went down in the games, unpack the town’s enduring appeal, and solve a few mysteries along the way. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why “Raccoon City?”</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Introduced in the opening seconds of the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a>, or “Bio Hazard” in Japan, “Raccoon City” had an important role to play in establishing the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil’s predecessor, the Japan-only Famicom game Sweet Home, took place in a haunted mansion in the Japanese countryside. Producer Tokuro Fujiwara wanted to remake the 8-bit cult classic for a new generation of consoles, but Capcom no longer had the rights to the film from which Sweet Home was adapted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So Fujiwara and director Shinji Mikami reworked the concept to center around zombies instead of haunted paintings, envisioning the game as an interactive horror movie, complete with a haunting score, cinematic pre-rendered backgrounds, and jump scares a-plenty. Instead of taking inspiration from supernatural, psychological J-horror such as Sweet Home, the developers instead looked toward the West.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/rc-new-1-1750851537527.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The terrifying streets of Raccoon City in Resident Evil 3. Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil clearly owes a massive debt to George A. Romero, the godfather of the zombie genre who shot his movies in the small cities surrounding Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Setting the game in a fictional Anytown, U.S.A. allowed Capcom to capture the vibe of classics like Dawn of the Dead and create inroads to a Western audience more effectively than any live-action FMV sequence with cheesy American actors</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early drafts of Bio Hazard had the action taking place in a town called “Harnbee,” located in either New Jersey or Arkansas. Capcom ultimately decided to name the city after an animal, which isn’t strange by itself, as the fine folks from Buffalo, New York or Dinosaur, Colorado will tell you. Still, adorable trash pandas seem like an odd choice for spine-chilling survival horror.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One longstanding theory is that Capcom was referencing the species of “raccoon dog” called tanuki, which Western gamers might be familiar with from its presence in Japanese folklore and pop culture. These cute little guys look a lot like raccoons, save for some slight anatomical differences, and they’ve quite frequently appeared in video games. So could “Raccoon City” just be a localized version of “Tanuki Town?” It’s not likely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one thing, tanuki aren’t even raccoons at all as far as taxonomy is concerned. More importantly, the original Bio Hazard refers to its setting as “Rakūn Shiti,” using the English transliteration of “raccoon” as opposed to “tanuki” or “araiguma,” the Japanese word for the actual species. With Raccoon City, Capcom is very specifically referring to the North American mammals. But why?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/rc-new-2-1750851561728.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The skyline of Raccoon City. Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Raccoons aren’t native to Japan, but in the ‘70s, a popular anime called Rascal the Raccoon led to tons of Japanese people importing the little critters to keep as pets. This was not a good idea, as anyone who has to deal with these feral, garbage eating creatures can tell you, and today, raccoons are classified as an “invasive alien species” that causes millions of dollars in damages to crops and wildlife all throughout Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Were the mindless swarms of flesh-devouring zombies that infest “Raccoon City” inspired by these destructive varmints? Could it be a commentary on America’s less-than-stellar reputation on the global stage, or at least the behavior of its most obnoxious tourists? It’s certainly possible, but it’s unlikely that a game that’s such a loving homage to American horror films would make that kind of dig. The real answer is probably more simple: the mansion is in a forest, Raccoons live in the forest, hence “Raccoon Forest,” which in turn gave the city its name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the end, Capcom wanted to make a zombie game set in the U.S. and came up with a plausible-sounding place for it to happen. There’s no hidden meaning or dark secret lurking at the heart of Raccoon City… At least, behind the scenes. Within the world of Resident Evil, there’s a lot going on beneath the surface.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Raccoon Rising</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nestled in the Arklay mountains, bordered by the sprawling Raccoon Forest to the north, was a small midwestern town called Raccoon City. Founded in the 1800s, RC was largely unremarkable until the end of the swinging ‘60s, when its struggling economy was revitalized by a corporate benefactor that would one day bring about its total destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1968, three best buds with a crazy dream got together to form the Umbrella Corporation. The plan? To create a superior breed of humans through twisted science. While none of the deeply unpleasant men who founded Umbrella had any deep ties to Raccoon City, Oswald E. Spencer just so happened to have some valuable real estate that would be perfect for their evil ambitions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few years earlier, in 1962, Sir Spencer commissioned a famous New York architect named George Trevor to build his dream home in Arklay County. Situated above a sprawling limestone cavern large enough to host a secret underground laboratory, the mansion was to be a recreation of Spencer’s childhood estate back in England… with a few twists.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/spencer-mansion-new-1750851611668.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The lobby of the creepy Spencer Mansion. Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Trevor made his name designing intricate buildings with traps, secret passageways, and tricksy puzzles–  the kinds of gimmicks that make lunatics like Spencer (and strategy guide writers) squeal. As the mansion neared completion in 1967, Spencer grew more paranoid, as evil masterminds tend to do. He was convinced that Trevor would reveal his secrets, so he convinced the architect to bring his family to Raccoon City and conspired to wipe them all out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer infected Trevor’s wife Jessica and daughter Lisa with the Progenitor Virus, precursor to the T-virus, the manmade zombie plague that would later doom Raccoon City. Jessica died, and was entombed beneath the mansion. Lisa survived, but mutated into a shambling, nigh-unkillable monstrosity. Umbrella kept Lisa prisoner for 28 years, experimenting on her to produce even deadlier concoctions like the G-virus. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for old George Trevor himself, he wound up trapped in a labyrinth of his own making. According to his diary, while searching for his family he actually forgot the solutions to the puzzles he created, which is relatable if nothing else. Unable to juggle all the crests, keys, and cranks that unlocked the Spencer Mansion, Trevor died of thirst and starvation deep within the bowels of his final masterpiece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With those loose ends somewhat messily tied up, Umbrella was free to continue with its mad science, thriving within a blissfully unaware Raccoon City. The town was growing rapidly, and the jobs provided by Umbrella paid for some much-needed infrastructure. Founded in 1969, the Raccoon Police Department eventually purchased a palatial art museum to convert into its headquarters at the urging of future chief (and madman) Brian Irons. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/lisa-trev-2-1750851671953.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lisa Trevor. Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now safe under the watchful eye of a deranged serial killer, the growing population soon enjoyed the benefits of a zoo and its adorable mascot, Mr. Raccoon, a kick-ass public transit system, a training school for gifted youngsters, a university, a bustling downtown shopping district, and at least one pro football team. Give it up for your Raccoon City… Sharks? RC also hosted a thriving media industry that somehow sustained eight newspapers and a TV news network, all cut down in their prime twenty years before the pivot to video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbrella kept the city’s economic blood pumping with its legit industries above ground, but the real money came from the top secret research it conducted under Raccoon City’s nose. The eugenicist vision of Spencer and the founders was largely replaced with the extremely lucrative industry of creating bio-organic weapons (B.O.W.s) for the highest bidder. Deadly as they are, the Hunters, Lickers, and Chimera Umbrella churned out by the truckload were merely the beta versions of its ultimate creation, the mighty Tyrant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the early ‘90s, Umbrella cemented its hold on Raccoon City by pouring tons of money into a revitalization project called “Bright Raccoon 21.” It built hospitals and orphanages, renovated the landmark clock tower, and recruited a special ops police unit called S.T.A.R.S. in 1996. It also took the opportunity to construct not one but two secret NEST facilities underground, where scientist William Birkin was hard at work on the G-virus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbrella owned the mayor, the police department, and employed 40% of the city’s 100,000 citizens. It had infected Raccoon City like one of its patented viruses, transforming the rust-belt industrial town into a bustling metropolis under the iron grip of Umbrella.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This didn’t last very long. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Raccoon City Destruction Incident</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation began spiraling out of Umbrella’s control in early 1998, when strange occurrences around Raccoon City started drawing unwanted attention. Strange dogs with wet, decaying flesh were spotted in the woods, and a series of grisly murders seemingly committed by cannibals had residents spooked about a possible death cult lurking in the forest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The heat made Umbrella nervous, so it called upon its intelligence agent extraordinaire, Albert Wesker. As the company man in charge of S.T.A.R.S., he was to lead the unit on a sham investigation to clean up the mess and retrieve precious combat data, the single most valuable commodity in the Resident Evil universe. Wesker, magnificent bastard that he is, was plotting to ditch Umbrella at the first opportunity, but he complied with his orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 23rd of July, 1998, the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team helicopter crashed in the forest, courtesy of Wesker’s sabotage. The man in the shades personally led Alpha team on a so-called rescue mission that trapped them in the iconic foyer of the Spencer Mansion. As the events of Resident Evil 1 play out, S.T.A.R.S. members Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine battle through zombies and B.O.W.s, discover the hidden lab beyond the manor walls, and learn of Umbrella’s role in the slaughter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bravo Team rookie Rebecca Chambers discovered in the extremely mid prequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-zero">Resident Evil 0</a>, the Mansion outbreak was the work of Umbrella co-founder James Marcus, or rather, a mutated leech posing as the murdered magnate. She reunites with Jill and Chris, only to be betrayed by Wesker, who unleashes Umbrella’s apex weapon on his former comrades. Wesker is seemingly skewered by the Tyrant, which is destroyed by a deus ex rocket launcher courtesy of cowardly pilot Brad “Chickenheart” Vickers, as the surviving S.T.A.R.S. members (and a chemically-enhanced Wesker) escape the exploding facility.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/final-resi-2-1750851849011.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rebecca Chambers and Chris Redfield battle Umbrella's Tyrant. Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbrella immediately went to work covering its tracks, hushing up any media murmurs and bribing Chief Irons to discredit and disband S.T.A.R.S. The corporation’s containment efforts were about as successful outside of the lab as in it, and the walls were closing in. Sightings of monsters in the Arklay region continued, growing ever closer to the town as summer turned to fall. William Birkin had seen enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The man behind the mutagenic G-virus was preparing to hand over his research to the U.S. government, in exchange for a clean slate and protection for himself, his wife Annette and daughter Sherry. Umbrella caught wind of his intentions and dispatched a spec-ops task force to NEST on September 22nd. In the ensuing firefight, Birkin injected himself with his G-virus, transforming into a body horror monstrosity and releasing T-virus samples among the city’s rats and into the water supply. Raccoon City would be overrun within days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The military descended on the city in a failed attempt to contain the disease, while Umbrella dispatched its own private mercenary group, the UBCS, to contain the situation. Umbrella also made the most of the opportunity to test new B.O.W.s, airdropping a Nemesis pursuer and handful of Tyrants into the chaos to dispatch unwanted survivors, recapture the G-virus, and explore their combat capabilities in a disaster scenario of its own design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the 28th of September, the RPD had fallen and the army had all but abandoned Raccoon City. Those who remained alive did whatever they could to survive the outbreak, often in episodic scenarios perfectly suited for online co-op sessions. On the 29th, a rookie cop with heartthrob hair arrived in Raccoon City, late for his first day on the job and somehow unaware of the destruction that lurked within. Welcome to Resident Evil 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon Kennedy linked up with Claire Redfield, a young woman searching for her brother Chris, who was off in Europe doing his own research on Umbrella. Together, the two sought refuge in the zombie-infested RPD, evading “Mr. X” and a mutated William Birkin with help from Ada Wong, an agent working for Umbrella’s unnamed corporate rival. Together, they storm the NEST, rescue Birkin’s daughter Sherry, witness Ada’s apparent demise, defeat their tormentors, and haul ass out of the self-destructing facility on a speeding train.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/final-resi-remake-2-1750851911598.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon holds his ground against the mutated William Birkin in the NEST. Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3">Resident Evil 3</a> revealed that Jill Valentine was trapped in town while all this was going down, her last escape halted by the relentless Nemesis, programmed to murder any remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. Jill teams up with Carlos Oliveira and his ragtag group of UBCS spooks to infiltrate the secondary NEST facility and find a vaccine. The Nemesis is destroyed, along with any potential T-virus cure, and Jill and Carlos flee the city shortly before its destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On October 1, the U.S. government decided to wash its hands of Raccoon City by wiping it off the map. The President ordered the launch of an experimental thermobaric missile to destroy the town, any evidence of the outbreak, and every living and unliving creature still inside. When the dust settled, all that remained of Raccoon City was a smoldering crater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbrella’s role in the disaster was exposed by journalist Alyssa Ashcroft, a survivor who revealed the existence of B.O.W.s to the world. The U.S. President resigned in disgrace, but the government managed to keep its dealings with Umbrella under wraps. Facing prosecutions, lawsuits, and dwindling sales following the death of 100,000 people, the Umbrella corporation shriveled and died, leaving Raccoon City as its final, shameful legacy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Uncanny City</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The few brief mentions of Raccoon City in Resi 1 sparked our imaginations, and RE 2 made them a reality. While the sequel largely took place inside the ornate RPD building, RE 2 begins with a bang, throwing Leon and Claire into the burning streets of Raccoon City proper and daring them to survive the horror. Clambering up fire escapes and sprinting past zombie-filled basketball courts was such a mind-blowing expansion of scope in 1998 that we didn’t really notice that Raccoon City doesn’t make any sense. At least, not for an American city.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pre-rendered backgrounds of the original Resi 2 and 3 are chock-full of narrow, winding streets and mazes of tiny alleys that lead to dead ends, none of which are really representative of a bustling mid-sized midwestern metro. In fact, Raccoon City as originally envisioned feels a lot like the commercial area of a Japanese city– Shinjuku draped in grimy Western set dressing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Japanese game devs in the ‘90s weren’t given the budget to fly across the Pacific to do in-depth research on cities in the United States– Konami famously used the Arnold Schwarzenegger family comedy Kindergarten Cop as its primary reference when conceiving the streets of Silent Hill. RC isn’t supposed to be an accurate U.S. city, it’s an imaginary version of one cooked up via Capcom’s cultural osmosis, based on its impressions of American culture from afar– it’s no coincidence that RE 2’s only accessible building outside of the RPD is Gun Shop Kendo. The result is a Raccoon City that feels familiar enough to Western audiences with a subtle undercurrent that something is wrong, the uncanny valley effect played out in environmental design. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/rc-old-2-1750851940796.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The streets of Raccoon City in the original PS1 version of RE2. Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This sensation diminished as the series evolved beyond pre-rendered backgrounds, with the multiplayer-focused Outbreak games returning to a fully polygonal RC. The somewhat forgotten spinoff has been thrust into the spotlight with the reveal that Resident Evil Requiem will star Grace Ashcroft, daughter of reporter Alyssa Ashcroft who was a prominent playable character in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-outbreak">Outbreak</a>. It’s a series worth revisiting even without the ability to play online, in large part because of how it expands Raccoon City. Survivors explore bars, hotels, apartment buildings, a zoo, and even Raccoon University campus, fleshing RC into a more fully realized space while maintaining the gritty, pre-HD vibe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The advent of the Resident Evil remakes gave Capcom the opportunity to update Raccoon City for a new generation. The impressive RE Engine provided realistic, high fidelity graphics, but it feels like something was lost in translation. While the city more closely resembles a thriving midwestern tourist destination, with towering skyscrapers and a more sensible urban layout, it sacrifices the otherworldly aesthetic of the original games. It feels less like a waking nightmare and more like an actual place– even though a real-life Raccoon City is rather implausible. Umbrella funding aside, the sheer amount of amenities and infrastructure built to serve such a small population would probably raise some suspicious eyebrows and definitely jack up the rent prices. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And even if it could exist in our world, that begs our final question: where is Raccoon City supposed to be? Capcom has never definitively stated its location, and the most specific the canonical series ever got was in the intro to the Resident Evil 3 remake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The (fantastic) tie-in novels by S.D. Perry explicitly placed the city in rural Pennsylvania, as did the screenplay for George Romero’s legendary unproduced Resident Evil adaptation. The Paul W.S. Anderson movies kept things vague, with some clues that Raccoon City is either near Allentown, PA or somewhere in Michigan, but most of the action was filmed in Toronto, Canada. The ill-fated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city">Welcome to Raccoon City</a> film was similarly shot in Ontario, but it too declined to name the state it stood in for.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/ashcroft-1750852007189.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">RE Requiem lead character Grace Ashcroft is the daughter of Alyssa, a character from RE Outbreak. Image credit: Capcom </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Countless fan theories have emerged throughout the decades, using every snippet of lore and a whole lot of logical leaps in an attempt to deduce the location of Raccoon City. Plausible arguments exist for Colorado, South Dakota, and even Cleveland, Ohio, but the prevailing hypothesis is that Raccoon is a stand in for Springfield, Missouri. There aren’t many mountains in the midwest, after all, but the foggy Arklay hills could be interpreted as Missouri’s Ozark region. Springfield also happens to be situated above massive limestone caverns with plenty of room for growing young B.O.W.s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few holes in this hypothesis, like the fact that Leon and Claire emerge from Raccoon City into a sprawling desert that is far removed from any geographic feature of the Show-Me State. The truth is, we probably were never supposed to know exactly where Raccoon City is– and maybe that’s what makes it so creepy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raccoon City could be the growing town up the road where a soulless corporation just built a new billion-dollar data center. It could be the quaint hamlet up by the woods that hosts a mysterious old house that’s rumored to be haunted. It could be your city, that one day you might have to escape in a desperate dash for survival. For nearly 30 years, Raccoon City has played host to countless mysteries and unanswered questions, some of which may finally be revealed in Requiem. But one thing has never been in doubt: Raccoon City is a scary place to be.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-resident-evils-raccoon-city]]></content:encoded>
