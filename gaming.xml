            <p>The Silent Hill fandom is seemingly split once again, this time over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s "soulslike" combat.</p>
<p>As more and more teasers and footage pop up online in the run-up to 25th September's launch day, fans are getting stuck into all the new gameplay. But while we already <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">knew</a> the combat would have a "heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>", fans are concerned about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">how enemies react</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mg6fn0/the_small_hypocrisy_im_seeing_for_silent_hill_f/">degradable weapons</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">"soulslike" boss encounters</a>.</p>
<p>"The game is looking incredible overall in terms of detail and quality. The amount of work the devs have put in is really impressive. That said, I’m a bit worried about how the combat is shaping up, specifically, how enemies react (or don’t react) when taking hits," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">said one player</a>.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't guy[s] please don't tell me it's true," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">lamented one fan</a>. "I love this series and I'm really hyped for the game, but please game devs, don't take this route, don't sacrifice what this series is know [sic] for to trend chase. Don't alienate your audience. I'm honestly scared if this is the direction there [sic] taking this series."</p>
<p>"The combat certainly concerns me. Even if it ends up being amazing, I feel apprehensive about a Silent Hill game having combat that evokes the counter timings of Sekiro," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf9o9e/comment/n6fl6ds/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> someone else. "Hopefully they pull a Bloober and prove me wrong. At the very least, I hope it’s a good horror game even if it ends up failing as a Silent Hill game."</p>
<p>To be fair, this isn't the first time the series has dabbled with degradable weapons – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> and Silent Hill Origins did, too, although how successful that was lies in the eye of the player, I guess. The problem for some, however, is how those degradable weapons could inhibit exploration.</p>
<p>"I'd like to scour the in-game world and pick up all the details/memos, but if I'm burning through my decent weapons at every stop to do so, I'm eventually gonna stop exploring to conserve resources," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf2maj/comment/n6ffoo9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested one fan</a>.</p>
<p>As for the other complaints? Well, there were plenty of those for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> in the run-up to release, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">turned out to be one of my favourite games in years</a> (and what I think is the only 5/5 I've awarded in all the years I've reviewed here). So the good news is, regardless of how the previews are making fans feel, September will be here before we know it.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>It's being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fandom-split-on-silent-hill-fs-soulslike-combat]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yes, hello folks, it's your regularly scheduled eShop Selects, this time for July 2025. As always, we're looking at the best of the rest — the best eShop exclusives you may have missed on Switch 1 and Switch 2. Yes, other games besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <em>did</em> come out, you know?</p>
<p>A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has kept the future looking bright for both consoles, so let's peel through the rules because we have a good one this month; our writers and contributors vote for their top three games from our pile of reviews of eShop exclusives that launched in July 2025. Those games are then scored (with 1 getting the highest score, 3 the lowest), then we tally the results up and the trio with the highest total make our top three.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wgqhpz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> is missing here, we know — review codes for the Switch release weren't available until launch day (the very last day of the month). So, we promise we're beavering away to get our impressions to you, but that's why you won't see it included below.</p>
<p>Overall, nine games made the cut for votes this month. Everything below scored at least a 7/10 or above, so here's what <em>just</em> missed out on the podium:</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">3rd Place - Time Flies</a></h2>
<p>Here's an odd gem we've had an eye on since a Day of the Devs stream a few years ago. Time Flies is a philosophical tale about a fly who only has a short amount of time to live. What can they do in that small slice of life they were handed from birth? Whatever they want.</p>
<p>Did you know flies can get drunk? Or make music? Or not be annoying? And look, we're not saying the timing of releasing after Mario Paint arrived on NSO (with that fly swatting game) was prophetic, but... okay, look, the art style is so similar.</p>
<p>Time Flies is short, sweet, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/time-flies">an excellent 8/10 pick-up</a> for the Switch.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:185093 @ 1754236535 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">2nd Place - Monument Valley 3</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Monument Valley</strong> series feels like a no-brainer for Switch, but amazingly, it took until this year to get <em>any</em> of the games on the hybrid series. Fortunately, the newest entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley III</a>, followed soon after. And it's just as excellent.</p>
<p>The lack of touch controls might be a dampener, but there's some incredibly thoughtful and clever puzzling to experience here. It's also beautiful to look at, with stunning uses of colour and perspective to make each puzzle shine. it might be the easiest of the trio, but it's still well worth a go.</p>
<p>Have a read of our review if you want to know more; it more than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/monument-valley-iii">earned its 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">1st Place - Patapon 1+2 Replay</a></h2>
<p>There was a clear winner for July, with the PSP's darling making a bold multiplatform comeback courtesy of Bandai Namco. That's right, it's all about 'pata-pata-pon-pon!' Congratulations to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, which got votes from all but one participant.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what Patapon is, you're basically an invisible entity commanding a group of strange creatures to the beat of their music. They'll react to your drum beats and run, guard, attack, and rush. Every single song is a complete earworm, and with all the helpful little features added into this version, both games have never played better.</p>
<p>We may have scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">a 7/10</a>, but it's still marched its way into our hearts.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-july-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While new viral hit Peak can often feel as challenging as it is fun to play, rumour has it that in the next day or so, the procedurally-generated map won't be tricky as much as it'll be unbeatable. Whoops.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media yesterday, developer Aggro Crab confessed that a modder on Discord had discovered an upcoming map will position a campfire – which players need to light in order to proceed to the next biome – on top of an "unreachable" tree.</p>

<p>"A modder in Discord has informed me that in two days there will be a map where the campfire spawns in an unreachable tree," the developer confessed. "Chat, do I go to the office on Saturday to fix this." The message was appended with a slew of crying emojis.</p> <div>

<p>Though Aggro Crab didn't specify what mod gave the player an early head's up, it's likely they're talking about the seed mod that lets people select a seed in config (in this case, it's <a href="https://x.com/digi_the_robot/status/1951899207390126389">reportedly</a> level_8).</p>
<p>The message spawned hundreds of replies, ranging from "<a href="https://x.com/Ringer_53/status/1951527964778074393">Nah, we'll live.

<p>"Just add a sign that says good luck lol," <a href="https://x.com/LucarnAnderson/status/1951633892513083696">wrote</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision was made to leave it be.</p>
<p>"I think with those you can make it [with a chain launcher or anti rope], so maybe fk it we ball," the developer eventually <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1951533385375162582">declared</a>.</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourself-peak-fans-aggro-crab-reckons-you-can-get-to-an-unreachable-campfire-thats-coming-up-soon]]></content:encoded>

<p>But before Gandalf comes a-knocking, let's take a look at what went down <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-blast-corps">last week</a>, when we matched up two different covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/blast_corps">Blast Corps</a>. In the battle of East and West, Japan came out on top, with the badass 'Blastdozer' cover taking 58% of the vote and leaving Europe and North America with the remaining 42%.</p>
<p>If you hadn't guessed it by now, we're taking a trip to Middle Earth this week (what can we say? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire</a> has put us in the mood for something... else) as we match up two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> on Game Boy Advance. Now, is it the best LOTR game out there? Not by a long shot, but it throws up two drastically different cover designs, so prepare for some whiplash.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0novlmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hobbit - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11cbe1e5d1144/the-hobbit-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14213-the-hobbit-the-prelude-to-the-lord-of-the-rings">Sierra Entertainment / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might expect the design for a game of The Hobbit — a <em>children's</em> book, let's not forget — to be bright, colourful, and full of fun. Not in the West, it seems. The North American and European design is all about the gloom, with slightly uncanny Bilbo standing front and centre, and uncanny Gandalf and Smaug looming behind.</p>
<p>Despite the gloominess, we quite like the design on this one. It promises drama and adventure in a way that the game never really delivered on, but there's no denying that ol' Mr Baggins looks rather heroic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hobbit - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82f3b73c9548d/the-hobbit-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14213-the-hobbit-the-prelude-to-the-lord-of-the-rings">Sierra Entertainment / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, now <em>this</em> is something else entirely. The Japanese design goes ham with the bright colours, placing Bilbo, Gandalf and Smaug (now joined by Gollum) in broad daylight, with the Lonely Mountain and Mirkwood backdrop not looking quite so menacing. The One Ring also makes an appearance on this one, you know, if you were curious <em>which</em> Hobbit the game was about.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Koei Tecmo has released an anniversary trailer for the Dynasty Warriors franchise which is now 25 years old. In the trailer, there is a flythrough of clips from across the games from the very beginning to Origins and it shows the evolutions that the series has gone through while maintaining the core gameplay. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The Dynasty Warriors anniversary trailer ends with two bits of big news for the series. The first is Dynasty Warriors Origins will be getting a major DLC, but there are no details on what that will entail. The second piece of news is that a Dynasty Warriors game will be getting remastered, but Koei Tecmo has not confirmed which of the games will get that treatment.</p>

<p>In our Dynasty Warriors: Origins review, Jim said, <em>“As someone who has zealously played every entry in the series since its inception more than two decades ago, I’d say Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the best Musou game ever. After years of unsurprising reiteration and plenty of misfires, Omega Force has delivered a smart and super polished reinvention of the Musou franchise that corrects so many of its past shortcomings.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-shows-off-available-weapons-in-new-trailer.1260882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're now in August, the launch month for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-shown-new-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and the developers have now released a brand new trailer to show off all the available weapon options in the game.</p>



<p>The first one is of course the sword, which allows for fast, 'split-second strikes'. The greatsword, on the other hand, is slower but capable of 'earth-shattering power'. The third weapon is the poleblade, which is said to deliver a 'piercing storm' to enemies. The fourth and final option is the scythe, which enables 'cutting-edge control' of its strikes. The trailer also demonstrates how Lost Soul Aside allows seamless weapons swapping even mid-combo. Players can, for example, launch an enemy in the air with one weapon and then slam it back down with another. </p>



<p>The unique stats of each weapon can significantly influence the player's tactical approach. The weapons can also be enhanced and customized by using special weapon fragments discovered throughout Lost Soul Aside. These fragments can alter the weapons' appearance, enhance combat or healing capabilities, and upgrade Kaser's fighting style. Players can attach fragments to their weapons and experiment with unique combinations to discover thrilling and powerful effects.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Weapons Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAq-nuQeLdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Lost Soul Aside wears its inspiration (mainly games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta) on its sleeve, although technically it is described as having roleplaying elements, too. Indeed, protagonist Kaser will grow even stronger throughout the game by attaining new skills and abilities unlocked via a dedicated Skill Tree. These powerful skills, which can boost damage, enhance healing, and generate protective shields, are granted by the dragon-like creature Arena.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to further intensify attacks with precise, high-impact bursts of strength by timing button presses during weapon combos to achieve devastating results. Finally, the Fusion Gauge can be filled through attack combos and abilities to summon Arena’s claws and fiercely strike enemies. This upgradeable skill unlocks new combat techniques as Kaser progresses in his mission.</p>



<p>After over ten years of development, the game that started as a solo project by Yang Bing is scheduled to launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 29. You can find the PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> arrived on the Switch late last year and it's received some updates since then including a performance boost.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, the developer has announced it's released a new patch for the Switch version, which brings it up to date with the PC release. You can see these previous patch updates for PC <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1887400/allnews/">via the game's Steam Page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch patch is now LIVE! Thanks everyone for your patience. This update brings the Switch version up to date with the PC release. Enjoy!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't tried out Antonblast yet, there's a demo you can check out. The game is also currently on sale in select regions, and you can read our full review here on Nintendo Life for more information. We gave it eight out of ten stars, calling it a great tribute to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wario_land_shake_it">Wario Land</a> series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whether on Switch or elsewhere, we’d suggest you pick this one up if you’re at all a fan of Nintendo’s <em>other</em> Italian mascot and are looking for a well-made and fast-paced new 2D platformer"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-dm-release-date-in-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-gm-release-date-in-october.1260792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update:</strong> In addition to the news from the official press release more was available as part of the Critical Role Direct.</p>

<p>The first piece of confirmation is that while Matthew Mercer will be stepping back from the GM chair for Critical Role Campaign 4 he will still be at the table, getting to be a full time player. While no other players were explicitly confirmed for the Campaign 4 table Matt did state that he would be playing "alongside [his] favorite familiar faces and a number of newer ones that I cannot wait to reveal to you."</p>

<p>It was also <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/critical-role-brennan-lee-mulligan-campaign-4-1236477230/" rel="nofollow">revealed via a Variety interview</a> that Brennan Lee Mulligan also just struck a new three-year development deal with Dropout so don't expect him to be leaving Dimension20 and the dome anytime soon.</p>

<p>In his interview with Variety, Mulligan teases that there is an announcement of what game system will be in use "scheduled and on route" but stayed tight-lipped on anything further.</p>


<hr><p>The Critical Role Direct has now released, and with it the confirmation of a release date for Critical Role Campaign 4, but also the confirmation about some details of who will be the GM for this game, and where it will take place… or at least where it WON'T take place.</p>



<p>Fans of Critical Role will be able to tune in and watch the first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4 when it returns to Thursday nights on October 2nd, 2025. At the time of posting, we're exactly two months away from this premiere.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt.jpg?itok=95B80vCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt.jpg?itok=D5lS-6k5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The much more unexpected news of this reveal is that <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matthew Mercer</a>, Dungeon Master for the previous three campaigns and CCO of Critical Role Productions, will not be the Game Master for Critical Role campaign 4. Instead, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan will be taking up the role of Game Master</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve been enormous fans of Brennan’s for many years now, and when it came to giving both Matthew Mercer and the world of Exandria a bit of a breather, Brennan felt like the perfect storyteller to take our community somewhere entirely new.” - Travis Willingham, CEO, co-founder, and cast member of Critical Role</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement from Willingham also reveals that Campaign 4 will not take place in Exandria, the world of Mercer's creation that has been the home for each main Campaign and various spin-offs like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dc0a217-e28f-4919-887d-2ef0511e836a" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton" rel="nofollow">EXU: Downfall</a>. This is further backed up by Marisha Ray, Creative Director and Co-Founder of Critical Role, stating, "Everything about Campaign 4 is fresh; new world, new tone, new possibilities. We can’t wait for the fans to experience what we’ve been building.”</p>

<p>Brennan Lee Mulligan is in no way a stranger to the Critical Role table, being not only a player but also the Dungeon Master in a number of spin-off settings. Mulligan had the following to say on the announcement and his taking on the GM role for Critical Role Campaign 4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What a gift, a privilege and an honor to be invited behind the screen of Critical Role for this next epic adventure. Every collaboration we have had together has brought nothing but sheer joy, and Campaign 4 will be no exception. I'm finally playing *almost* as much tabletop as I'd like to!"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Will Critical Role Campaign 4 be <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> or <em>Daggerheart</em>?</h2>

<p>While this announcement answered a few questions that fans had been clamouring to find out about the future of Critical Role, it does certainly leave a number still unanswered.</p>

<p>Who will be playing in Campaign 4? Will Matt have a chance to play at the table or focus on continued world-building? Is Robbie Daymond going to be back at the table? Will Campaign 4 be as long as a standard multi-year Campaign of Critical Role?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-age-of-umbra.jpg?itok=gw7DfDfW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-age-of-umbra.jpg?itok=Tu9e6n2N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps the biggest question left unanswered is whether Critical Role Campaign 4 will use <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> as the previous campaigns have, or if they'll move on to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="951117a2-07e4-403b-b1c3-26041d599e45" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, Critical Role and Darrington Press' newly released TTRPG. It is curious that the press release and announcement only use generic terms such as 'Game Master' and 'TTRPGs'.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/gencon2025-announcements/" rel="nofollow">announcement of a second season of Age of Umbra</a>, a <em>Daggerheart </em>campaign in a Grimdark setting that Mercer designed, it may be that Mercer is continuing to work on <em>Daggerheart </em>adventures while Mulligan spins stories in a world built for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>TechRaptor reached out to Critical Role for any potential answers but were advised that at this time the Campaign 4 release date and that Brennan Lee Mulligan would be helming the table were all they were ready to talk about. There are two months to go until the release of Critical Role Campaign 4 so be on the lookout for announcements related to the setting, cast, and more.</p>

        <p>A BioShock 1 remake has also reportedly been cancelled.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cloud Chamber, the studio tasked with reviving the decade-dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> series, has reportedly failed an internal review with 2K Games execs, resulting in a leadership shakeup.</p>
<p>Anonymous sources speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> said it was the game's narrative, in particular, that apparently failed to impress, and was "identified as an area in need of improvement [that] will be revamped in the coming months".</p>

<p>Following the review, studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted, and creative director Hogarth de la Plante moved into "a publishing role". The rest of the Cloud Chamber team was told in an all-hands meeting that the company needed "to become more agile and efficient". Colleagues are now worried that cuts may follow.</p>
<p>In response to the report, a 2K spokesperson acknowledged the change at the top of the studio to Bloomberg, saying it remained "fully committed to ensuring we deliver a BioShock game that exceeds the lofty expectations of our fans".</p>
<p>"We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future," 2K Games said in a statement. "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path."</p>
<p>Sadly, there's even more bad news for BioShock fans. Right at the end of the report, Bloomberg confirmed both the existence - and the cancellation - of a remake of the first BioShock game. It's unclear why the project was cancelled, but sources say it was shelved earlier in the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">Netflix's BioShock adaptation was similarly "reconfigured" last year</a> to be a "more personal" film with a tighter budget. Producer Roy Lee told fans at a panel at last year's San Diego Comic-Con that changes at the top of Netflix's movie department have seen the budget streamlined, so "we're doing a much smaller version... It's going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive]]></content:encoded>

            <p>GOG has launched an all-new project to raise awareness of censorship in gaming: <a href="https://items.gog.com/freedomtobuy/index.html">FreedomToBuy.Games</a>.</p>
<p>The digital games platform, which has long been campaigning for the better preservation of DRM-free games, said it believes that "if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today – and decades from now".</p>
<p>Consequently, for the next 28-ish hours or so at the time of writing, it is offering up 13 games for free – including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/postal-2">Postal 2</a>, Agony, and House Party – "because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Thanks to the dedication of developers and publishers, we are launching <a href="https://t.co/Y26XDapvYH">https://t.co/Y26XDapvYH</a>.</p><p>To raise awareness on censorship in gaming, 13 games are now available for free for 48h as a part of stand for creative freedom and preservation.</p><p>We believe that if a game is legal… <a href="https://t.co/3kTRnYjQTi">pic.twitter.com/3kTRnYjQTi</a></p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1951380136181338230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Thanks to the dedication of developers and publishers, we are launching FreedomToBuy.games," the company said in a statement. "To raise awareness on censorship in gaming, 13 games are now available for free for 48h as a part of stand for creative freedom and preservation.</p>
<p>"We believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today – and decades from now. It’s our statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder."</p>
<p>The campaign comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a> in June. Shortly thereafter, we learned itch.io had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>, which similarly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">"retired" unspecified NSFW titles and introduced vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p>
<p>GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced its Preservation Program last November</a>, when 100 games were part of the line-up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79ddf65dd41c1/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Two of my favourite games growing up were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>. Lush green worlds, curious — and sometimes cute — enemies, and fluid action combat for the time; as someone who had largely only played turn-based RPGs for the first eight years of their life, the SNES era of action RPGs showed me a glimpse of what video games were capable of. These games in particular made me feel bold and adventurous, and whenever I revisit them as an adult, they fill me with a childlike sense of wonder.</p>
<p>So I am very much the target audience for the upcoming action RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>. I adore HD-2D, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">Octopath Traveler II</a> is one of my favourite Switch games and RPGs of all time. But at the same time, I wanted Team Asano and Square Enix to do something a little different with this beautiful art style; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-it-time-for-hd-2d-to-take-a-break">I was a little worried about the direction it seemed to be taking</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I wasted no time downloading the demo after the July Partner Showcase, and even after spending two hours with it, and recognising a few kinks that need to be ironed out, The Adventures of Elliot feels like a shot in the arm for this aesthetic style, and I'm itching for more.</p>

<p>Like Octopath before it, The Adventures of Elliot is aiming to recapture some of that SNES magic, but in the action department rather than the turn-based. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/illusion_of_gaia">Illusion of Gaia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/terranigma">Terranigma</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ys_iii_wanderers_from_ys">Ys III</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/beyond_oasis">Beyond Oasis</a>; all of that ilk feed into top-down Japanese-developed action RPG history, and it's on show here. But the Zelda love is overwhelming — after all, the eponymous hero is wearing red instead of green, he has a fairy companion, you can throw pots... it's all here, just with a few unique wrinkles.</p>
<p>The best part of the Debut Demo is the world itself. Exploring this small corner of Philabieldia (not a typo) is extremely moreish for me, and gives us a little insight into what's to come. Of course, the first thing I did was cut some grass, but while mowing the lawn, I ignored my quest marker and headed south towards a desert area, where I found cracked walls to bomb and shrubs to remove. I found a challenge tomb which gave me a health increase along the way, too. Eventually, I stumbled into a cave, which acted like a miniature dungeon.</p>
<p>There are combat rooms to clear and a few puzzle-platforming sections which forced me to consider the dungeon's layout; dropping down certain sand dunes took me to lower floors, but certain areas were only accessible by dropping down certain holes. The last dungeon of the demo does something similar with lily pads and switches. All standard stuff, but made more fun thanks to your fairy companion.</p>

<p>No, Faie isn't Navi; she might speak a little too much, but Faie is a necessary part of Elliot's adventure because she comes with the ability to fight enemies, gather items. She spends most of the time following you around, but you can also move her by using the right stick. Alternatively, you can command her to fly ahead, stop, disappear, or come back to you. Or, if you want a little Secret of Mana magic, a friend can join you for some couch co-op and take control of her.</p>
<p>Faie's best assets come from her skills, however. One of these is a dash that allows you to run at an extremely fast speed for a limited time, crucial for getting around fast or for traversing crumbling floors. The other is a warp which is extremely useful for getting across larger gaps. It makes dungeon exploration genuinely interesting, going beyond just walking through caves and corridors and fighting enemies.</p>
<p>It's a similar story with combat, which has a few little touches to make Elliot's adventure feel a bit unique. The basics are familiar — you have standard and charged attacks, but variety comes in from weapons and upgrades you can equip and acquire. Along with a sword and shield, you start with some bombs and a bow (see the Link here?), though my noodling around the map and an optional boss led me to a brand new weapon: a chain and sickle.</p>

<p>The chain and sickle rules and was immediately more powerful than my sword. A tap of the 'X' button and the sickle would swing around me in a wide radius. Hold it down, and it spins around Elliot a short distance, effectively acting as a shield. Charge the sickle up, and you can pull enemies towards you. It's so satisfying to pull off. Except when you manage to pull a big enemy with a club towards you just as it's about to bonk you on the head.</p>
<p>There's actually a lot of risk-reward stuff going on here, which made the otherwise simple combat that little bit more engaging. Before I even left the opening town, I bought an accessory that increased my movement speed slightly, but also meant I took some extra damage from enemies. Couple that with diving into the thick of it with the sickle, and it meant I had to be a little more cautious on how I took out big groups of enemies.</p>
<p>Magicite, equippable gems that provide stat increases and weapon buffs, also come with various help-and-hinder effects. One piece of sword magicite increased my base attack power, but at the cost of slowing down my shield recovery time. Another allowed arrows to pierce through enemies, but reduced the damage they did. It meant I had to weigh up my equipment options more carefully and — like badges in Paper Mario — I also had a set amount I could equip.</p>

<p>I'm not much of a blocker in video games, which probably explains my rusty fighting-game skills, but in The Adventures of Elliot, blocking is pretty important. There's no dodge, which took me a minute to adjust to, but a perfectly-timed block stuns an enemy and gives you a few free hits. For an action RPG, it pays to be patient and think things through, especially in the boss fights, which are effectively like little puzzles. Just like many, many Zelda bosses, there are semi-obvious weak points that you have to exploit with all your tools and then strike away to win. The two I fought weren't challenging, but they did make me smile.</p>
<p>There are a few things that Square Enix and Claytechworks need to iron out, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-wants-feedback-about-its-new-hd-2d-game-coming-to-switch-2">but that's what this demo is for</a>; the frame rate is a little inconsistent, out in the open world, things are a little blurry, and the quick menu isn't exactly zippy. But, as an appetizer for things to come, it's the perfect start to whet my appetite. Even with a new Octopath announcement during the Direct, The Adventures of Elliot was the standout reveal for me, and playing it has only cemented it as one of my most-anticipated games for Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
