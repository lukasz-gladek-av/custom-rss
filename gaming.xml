<figure data-uuid="f3fc8a98f2e28"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Peach Winking" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3fc8a98f2e28/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-peach-winking.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 is approaching its eight-month anniversary, and developers across the world are interested in getting their games on the newest gaming system out there. At least, that's what <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">GDC's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a> reveals (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/twice-as-many-developers-surveyed-by-gdc-say-they-want-to-make-games-on-ps5-or-switch-2-than-on-xbox/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>The report shows that 39% of developers surveyed are at least interested in the Switch 2. That puts it fourth, but barely, as the PS5 and Steam Deck are both at 40%, while PC is way ahead at 80%.</p>
<p>Looking at a few other platforms, the Switch 2 is almost twice as popular as the Xbox Series X | S, which only 20% of the sample of developers are apparently interested in. The original Switch console still has some eyes on it, too, with 13% of developers still keen to develop for the system</p>
<p>In terms of platforms that developers have used to release their most recent games, the Switch consoles are a little lower down — 21% of devs have released a Switch game, with 18% getting their game on the newer Switch 2, from those surveyed. Both are behind the Xbox One, which sits at 23%.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch is a much-less powerful system than other consoles, and the Switch 2 has only been out since June 2025, so those numbers will likely go up this time next year, and as more developers get their hands on dev kits.</p>

<p>But the numbers for the Switch consoles here are a little closer, because more people have a Switch 1 than Switch 2. And that's backed up by a further poll, where developers and companies surveyed were asked what they consider most when choosing a platform to release their game on.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the top result was audience reach, with 78% of developers picking that option. Business model success and discoverability also ranked highly, with 44% and 43% of votes respectively. So it's all down to easy-of-access and past successes, then.</p>
<p>So, it's a pretty good start for the new console, in our eyes. And with a third-party-stacked 2026 ahead of us, we think things can only go up from here. Or, we hope, at least.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>What do you think of the GDC survey results here? Do you think we'll see a wider spread of games on Switch 2 in 2026? Share your thoughts down in the usual spot.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-split-fiction-film-with-sydney-sweeney-has-a-script-says-hazelight-boss-josef-fares/</link>
            <guid>1421248</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Split Fiction</strong> is one of the many video game-to-film or TV adaptations that <strong>Amazon</strong> has under its belt, and it appears that the adaptation starring <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/"><strong>Sydney Sweeney</strong> and directed by <strong>Jon M. Chu</strong></a> has hit a major milestone in the course of its production, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/"><strong>Hazelight </strong>boss <strong>Josef Fares</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezone</a> in a red carpet interview at the <strong>Guldbagge Awards</strong> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>), Fares confirmed that he had seen the first finalized version of the script, and confirmed that he's met Sydney Sweeney in a meeting, but he's not holding his breath about anything just yet. </p>



<p>"<em>I got the first version of the script today," </em>Fares told Moviezone<em>, "but you know, there’s so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this ‘I believe it when I see it.'</em>" Regarding Sweeney, Fares didn't have much to add beyond, "<em>I’ve had a meeting with her and she seems super chill</em>."</p>



<p>We first learned that a Split Fiction movie was in the works back in April 2025, but it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">June 2025 that Amazon MGM won the bidding war</a> to get the film's production rights that it had found a home. Now, it has a script, and while there are plenty of steps to go before we can really start to look forward to the movie, it's better to hear some updates instead of nothing, which is currently the case with <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/">the <strong>It Takes Two </strong>film that was announced back in 2022,</a> and we haven't heard anything about it since.</p>



<p>Split Fiction isn't the only video game adaptation Sweeney is working on, as she's also signed on to <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">produce an adaptation of <strong>Out Run</strong> alongside <strong>Michael Bay</strong></a>. As for Amazon, it is currently days away from the premiere of the season two finale for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Fallout </strong>TV show adaptation</a>, and lately we've been hearing a lot about the cast for the coming <strong>God of War </strong>TV series, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> all confirmed to be a part of the cast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594</link>
            <guid>1421239</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Yesterday, Google revealed its Project Genie AI-generation tool, allowing people to make “interactive environments” in seconds using just prompts. Today, in response to this, a bunch of investors seem to think this is the future of game development and are bailing on big game companies. This has led to stocks tanking for companies like Take-Two and <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174">Roblox</a>.</p> <p>On January 29, Google started rolling out early access to a new “experimental research prototype” AI tool named Project Genie. It is powered by Genie 3 and Gemini and allows users to create 3D worlds you can move around in simply by inputting a text prompt, like “Cartoonish 3D racing game with toy cars.” <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">As reported by <em>The Verge</em> on Thursday</a>, the tool can also be used to create “games” that look a lot like <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, something I imagine Nintendo won’t be happy about.</p>

 <p>While Genie’s creations aren’t games at all, just 3D environments that you can explore for a short amount of time, it seems many investors believe that tools like Genie will soon magically be making entire games. There’s been a bunch of sudden stock sell-offs across the gaming industry on Friday as a result.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ijzk33hik37peth6s45vndeb/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdnsxei4lk2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiaijody4fvos6knzduiwmseo2dgu7b5imtxilea5fnkgaiara4uny"> <p lang="en">Video game stocks are suddenly crashing today with the launch of Google's Project Genie as investors think games will start magically getting made with AI</p> <p>➡️ ca.investing.com/news/stock-m… </p> <p>#GoogleGemini #TakeTwo #CDProjektRED #Roblox #videogames</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ijzk33hik37peth6s45vndeb?ref_src=embed">Shinobi602 (@shinobi602.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ijzk33hik37peth6s45vndeb/post/3mdnsxei4lk2w?ref_src=embed">2026-01-30T17:23:17.949Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><a href="https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unity-stock-falls-alongside-taketwo--roblox-after-googles-project-genie-launch-4429665">As reported by <em>Investing.com</em>,</a> the stock price for numerous publishers and console manufacturers is tanking today after Genie’s reveal. As of 1:05 p.m. EST, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> publisher Take-Two Interactive was down over nine percent. Roblox’s stock price had slid nearly 12 percent. Video game engine company Unity’s stock is down a whopping 20 percent. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG7DeRlALEalto-xnKvXTp7KQFjICvRwxzk5IiImf36NuZ2544k6LSSE4RRCuiQ4hR08ut2AtuKtmdnAuNNNmMmyD8VAc89FQQzP8_97U5BPHLDgp7uWBsLjJqa7C3K-DeXSsmw3cVeevxwUJ0Knf4DrbMbSdGoTxdyOfUhcNN1p">And even Nintendo stock is down</a> nearly five percent. These tumbles all happened today, which seems to directly connect the slides to the reveal of Google’s new Genie tool.</p>

 <p>At the moment, the interactive experiences Google’s tool can produce last only one minute, run at 24 frames per second, and cap out at 720p. They also lack stability, with one demo featuring a race track changing mid-gameplay. The tool can also be used to create replicas of games like Mario 64, though Google seems nervous about this ability, with the AI tool eventually stopping a <em>Verge</em> reporter from making more Mario “games” due to “the interests of third-party content providers. Meanwhile, other people are already using the tool to make ugly, horrible versions of <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/genie-3-ai-video-games-gta-6-dark-souls/"><em>GTA 6 </em>and<em> Dark Souls.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

 <p>But for the people with all the money, none of this matters. They see a future where game devs and companies aren’t needed, and this magic AI tool can save money and quickly produce the next <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>GTA.</em> Good luck with that.</p>

              <p>You were just checking the time. That’s all. But there was a notification, and it could have been important, but it turned out to be a link to a funny post on BlueSky. And now it’s 47 minutes later and you’ve doomscrolled through page after page of news and reaction to the seemingly unending torrent of horror being visited upon the country and world, and you feel helpless, wound up, and sad. Oh, and what time is it? Stop! Stop this madness! Your phone is a whole gaming console in one tiny slab! So next time you pick it up, click onto one of these fabulous games instead.</p> <p>All the following games are selected because they’re such incredibly good ways to spend those spare moments of time when you’d otherwise be tempted to look at the algorithm’s horror. These are the games that’ll fit in on the train ride, during coffee, or as you’re sitting outside waiting for your kid to emerge from the school, and they’re also a great way to while away the last hour before you fall asleep at night. As such, I’m not selecting games like <em>Honkai Star Rail</em> or&nbsp;<em>Warframe</em> because firstly they’re just better on a bigger screen, and secondly because that sort of game is an entire second job in itself. This is all about the perfect way to distract your brain and fingers in a fulfilling, non-terrifying manner.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Slay the Spire</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slay-the-spire/id1491530147">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humble.SlayTheSpire&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>Mega Crit’s legendary <em>Slay the Spire</em> might be more immediately associated with PC and console, but in the years after its 2019 release it was brought to iOS and Android in an absolutely perfect port. The pioneering roguelite deckbuilder remains as all-consuming today as it did seven years back, and the shorter battles and ability to quit out and pick back up where you left off make it ideal for quick plays on your phone. Or indeed entire evenings consumed with mastering a deck to defeat everything in your path. It’s one of the few properly priced mobile games at $10, but remember you’re buying one of the best games ever made, with a minimum play time of infinity hours.</p> <hr> <h2>Balatro</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502453075">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstack.balatro.android&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>2024’s smash hit took its time coming to mobile, but arrived in glorious style. The poker-ish game took the world by storm on PC and console in February 2024, and then became the entire planet’s meta when it reached iOS and Android that September. It remains one of the finest ways you can occupy your spare time, each run a unique experience as you shape your deck and Jokers to win your way through the rounds and challenges. Like <em>Slay the Spire</em>, it’s $10, and worth every cent.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Polimines Deluxe</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polimines-deluxe/id6473717385">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penguinpopgames.poliminesdeluxe&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>Spanish indie developer Molter Games might not be a household name, but puzzle game&nbsp;<em>Polimines&nbsp;</em>deserves to be. This combination of puzzles like&nbsp;<em>Picross</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hexcells</em> and&nbsp;<em>Minesweeper</em> creates a unique and enormously clever challenge. This mobile version combines both the PC’s <em>Polimines 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2</em>, which works out perfectly since the sequel pretty much picks up where the difficulty for the first game left off. Every solved puzzle in the second half will make you feel like a complete genius. And the whole thing is only $5.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Sparklite</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sparklite/id1553922886">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.sparklite&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>RPG&nbsp;<em>Sparklite</em> was generally liked when it came out in 2019, without blowing anyone away. It’s a gorgeous roguelite in which you play as Ada, on her broken airship, making trips to the world of Geodia below to gather items and “patches” and battle mighty Titans. Each failure is an opportunity for a new attempt, with the progression of creating new stores and crafting stations on her floating island, and applying the patches into machines that create a unique set of skills and attacks to shape how you play. It got a bit lost on console, even the great version on Switch, but it just works so incredibly well as a mobile game. A good run can fill a commute, and there’s a constant sense of progression that makes you want to pick it back up for another try on the way home.</p> <hr> <h2>The New York Times Games</h2> <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyt-games-wordle-crossword/id307569751">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>No, not technically a game, but by far one of the very best ways to spend time on your phone. <em>Wordle</em> and others are free, but if you pay the sub (and you can get it incredibly cheap—I’m paying around $3 a month), you get access to the daily <em>NYT</em> crossword alongside <em>Connections</em>, <em>Strands</em>, <em>The Mini</em> (crossword), <em>Pips</em> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ALGL4Hm5g8">Spelling Bee</a>, as well as access to their archives. There are now bots for a bunch of these that’ll analyze your play, and it just added two-player Crossplay, the most blatant, bare-faced Scrabble rip-off since <em>Worlds With Friends</em>. I start each day with <em>Wordle</em> and <em>The Mini</em>, end each day with the crossword and <em>Spelling Bee</em>, and the others sneak in for coffee breaks. (Bonus game: check out the amazing <a href="https://squaredle.app/"><em>Squardle</em></a> which also has an app.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Stuffo the Puzzle Bot</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stuffo-the-puzzle-bot/id6444358789">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Hapatus.Stuffo&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>There’s a good chance you’re familiar with the extraordinary old-school dungeon crawler&nbsp;<em>Legend of Grimrock</em>. But the next game from one of its two main developers deserves to be equally lauded. <em>Stuff the Puzzle Bot</em> is one of the most brilliantly clever puzzle games you’ll ever play, one of those where discovering the solution makes you feel like you’ve made a momentous breakthrough and simultaneously want to buy flowers for the creator. The component parts look familiar—using a little robo to pick up and rearrange blocks of various types such that he can reach a level’s exit—but rarely has this been so exquisitely executed. The mobile version is perhaps even better than the PC build, with fingertip controls making so much sense.</p> <hr> <h2>Shattered Pixel Dungeon</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shattered-pixel-dungeon/id1563121109">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p><em>Pixel Dungeon</em> by Watabou (Oleg Dolya) was originally released for mobile in 2012, and was a delightful micro-dungeon crawler. But best of all, it was released as free software, with anyone else welcome to lift its entire code and create their own versions, even for sale. The result has been a huge range of splendid variants, and it’s generally agreed the best of these is <em>Shattered Pixel Dungeon</em> by Evan Debenham—it’s certainly my favorite. A project that was meant to last a few months has eventually led to 12 years of work so far, with new content added roughly every three months, and yet the game feels uncomplicated and welcoming to play. It’s $5, and will occupy you for the rest of time.</p> <hr> <h2>Loop Hero</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loop-hero/id6464048549">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.loophero&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>Another PC roguelite that found its way to mobile three years later, <em>Loop Hero</em> feels so very at home on your phone. This is a game that’s essentially about walking around in a circle, but what a circle it is. Instead of controlling your character, you play “cards” that lay obstacles, enemies and advantages, as well as mountains and marshes, around the circuit of road on which the character walks. He or she then battles the path’s foes, with each loop more dangerous than the last, and you left deciding if you’ll risk another go-around or chicken out and bring your hero back to base with the loot to develop farms and structures and their resulting advantages. Making its game a literal loop creates a perfect one-more-go mobile game. It’s free to download, and then $7 to unlock the full game.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Holedown</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holedown/id1297270249">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grapefrukt.games.bore&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>The brilliant minds at Grapefrukt Games have brought us some all-time classic mobile games, like&nbsp;<em>Rymdkapsel</em> and&nbsp;<em>Twofold Inc</em>, and most recently&nbsp;<em>Subpar Pool</em>. But it’s&nbsp;<em>Holedown</em> that permanently lives on my phone. This brilliantly clever variant on the&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em> format has you bouncing squillions of balls around the screen, trying to destroy strangely shaped blocks by hitting them until their number is reduced to zero. And really interestingly, the core game is designed to be finished, a series of levels you will progress through, rather than presenting you with a <em>Tetris</em>-like increase in difficulty that increases until you inevitably game over. But it has that too, via an infinite mode with bragging rights for how far you can reach. It’s a sublimely satisfying game to play, and a very reasonable $4.</p> <hr> <h2>Crying Suns</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crying-suns/id1511788295">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altshift.cryingsuns&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>If you’re after something a bit more strategic to stop those doomscrolling fingers, then it’s worth remembering 2019’s&nbsp;<em>Crying Suns.</em> Inspired by&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>, but putting you in charge of a far larger, far more involved ship, with several hundred crew members to worry about. With multiple sectors to explore, and deep tactics required for combat, this is perhaps one of the more involved games in the list, and yet as a roguelite it’s still intended to be played in more controlled bursts. It’s generally far better to be distracted by the peril of your fictional crew than anything going on outside the window just now. $9 for all that.</p>

 <hr> <h2>And now you…</h2> <p>This is a list that could continue on until it reaches the bottom of the internet; mobile gaming is a wonderful source of fantastic entertainment, and in between all the more involved and longer-term <em>Diablo Immortal</em>s<em>, </em>revamped Square Enix RPGs,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>s are a billion options that’ll provide the perfect shorter-term alternative to a doomscroll. I picked these 10 because I thought of them first, but another day it could easily have been any number of other collections. So please, drop suggestions to any games you’d recommend into the comments!</p>

<p>WWE 2K returns to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a>, and with it comes a number of new features exclusive to the platform.</p>



<p>This year’s game will include several options that weren’t available to players in WWE 2K25.</p>







<p>Thanks to the design of the system, WWE 2K26 features touchscreen and mouse support on the console. There will also be the ability to play with a single Joy-Con as well GameShare and GameChat support.</p>



<p>Circling back on the mouse support, players will be able to use the built-in Joy-Con mouse within Creation Suite for face and body paint. </p>



<p>And one feature that was missing last year that makes its way to the game is image uploading and cross-platform community creations.</p>







<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. However, if you buy one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more expensive versions</a> of the game, you will get access a week before everyone else on March 6.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamestop-ceo-has-a-plan-to-earn-his-35b-bonus-acquire-a-massive-publicly-traded-company-in-a-genius-or-totally-foolish-move/</link>
            <guid>1421209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>GameStop</strong> chief executive officer <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong> has the chance at a major, major payday if he can make good on a goal set for him by GameStop's board of directors. Amidst discovering that GameStop would be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/">shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</a></strong>, we also learned that if Cohen successfully turned the company that's worth a staggering <strong>$100 billion</strong>, then he would earn a <strong>$35 billion bonus</strong>. And now, it seems that Cohen has a plan on how to make that happen.</p>



<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/gamestop-ceo-plans-e8440c4b">Wall Street Journal</a>, the plan is essentially to buy his way to that growth by expanding beyond more than just being a video games retailer. Cohen plans to acquire a publicly traded company in a "<em>big</em>" deal, with the Journal identifying he'll be looking "<em>likely in the consumer or retail industry</em>."</p>



<p>On his plan, Cohen added, "<em>It's ultimately either going to be <strong>genius or totally, totally foolish</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Currently, GameStop is worth about <strong>$11 billion</strong>. To earn the full $35 billion bonus, Cohen would have to turn GameStop into a $100 billion market-cap company and reach a <strong>$10 billion</strong> EBITDA measure. Even when <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/">GameStop had its meteoric meme-stock rise back in 2021</a>, the company's market cap peaked at <strong>$33.7 billion</strong>, which falls more than a few billion short of Cohen's goal.</p>



<p>That said, the Journal's report adds that Cohen could still earn a partial bonus by increasing the company's market cap beyond <strong>$20 billion</strong> and reaching a <strong>$2 billion </strong>EBITDA measure. It won't be the full $35 billion, but if Cohen can manage to recreate some of the success that the company lucked into in 2021, he'll be able to take some sort of bonus home. </p>



<p>"<em>There are a lot of diamonds in the rough…that have sleepy management teams</em>," Cohen said about his plan and the layoffs GameStop has already been through. "<em>I didn’t fix GameStop to stop there</em>." The jury is still out as to whether Cohen did actually fix GameStop, which seems more interested <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">in making meme and troll-centred comments online</a> and closing stores than selling video games, but since Cohen did this interview with the Wall Street Journal, the company's stock was up <strong>3.5%</strong> this morning.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-early-access-scenes-restored-out-now/</link>
            <guid>1421206</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <strong>Baldur's Gate 3 mod</strong></a> aims to <strong>restore several deleted scenes</strong> from the game's early access version, which ran on PC for nearly three years before the full launch. Aptly titled '<strong>Early Access Scenes Restored</strong>', the mod created by Nexus user HyperspaceTowel has managed to reinject a lot of cut content and even create brand new cutscenes. Here's the overview:</p>



<ul>
<li>More NPC encounters and camp events</li>



<li>More companion reactivity</li>



<li>More approvals (or disapprovals)</li>



<li>Brand new content: some of the cutscenes were made from scratch</li>
</ul>



<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 mod adds back these NPCs and camp events:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting the camp for the first time</li>



<li>Enthralled fishermen</li>



<li>Nerela</li>



<li>Rurik</li>



<li>Seashell kid</li>



<li>Gale's deer stew</li>



<li>Gale's loss</li>



<li>Post-Druid civil war</li>



<li>Shadowheart's ultimatum</li>



<li>Ceremorphosis beckons...</li>
</ul>



<p>Several of the companions already available in the game's first Act, like Astarion, Gale, Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Karlach, and Wyll, now react to specific story events once again. The modder also claims to have reworked some scene cinematics to improve the camera work and timing. Some Early Access cut lines were spliced into the full release dialogues, some Origin dialogue options were added here and there, and brand new scenes were created for Wyll and Karlach.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to the modder, there's still more cut Baldur's Gate 3 content to restore, including Thralls on the Nautiloid, even more Wyll and Karlach reactivity, and additional voiced dialogue for Tav.</p>



<p>In other Baldur's Gate 3 news, earlier this month, <strong>Larian</strong> CEO <strong>Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-would-have-loved-baldurs-gate-3-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the lack of a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version</a>. He said the developer would have loved to port the game to the hybrid console, hinting that the reason it doesn't exist is due to the IP owner, <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>.</p>

If you wanted to go wireless, your best option was the 8BitDo 64 which offered a similar button and joystick layout as the N64’s original controllers, but with a modernized design. For a more authentic but conveniently wireless N64 experience, <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/2017266637154435335?s=61">Analogue has released an update for the 3D</a> today that adds support for Nintendo’s modernized N64 controller.</p><p>Nintendo’s wireless controller was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">announced in 2021 alongside N64 games</a> coming to the Nintendo Switch Online platform. Coming from Nintendo it’s about as accurate a recreation of the N64’s original hardware as you can find, but at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller%2F" rel="sponsored">$54.99</a> it’s more expensive than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Analogue-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DK6VCGBC/ref=sr_1_1?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$39.99 8BitDo 64</a>, and it can only be purchased if you’re already subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online service. The only way to get a more authentic wireless N64 controller is to upgrade the original wired versions using <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-n64-controller?variant=42794771415217">8BitDo’s $39.99 Mod Kit</a>.</p><p>The Analogue 3D version 1.2.0 firmware update is <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/3d/firmware/1.2.0">available for download now through the company’s website</a> and <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/3d/guide/getting-started#updating-3dos">can be installed</a> by either copying it to the console’s memory card, or connecting the 3D to a PC with a USB-C cable.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/persona-metaphor-refantazio-kazuma-kaneko-card-game-ai-art-tsukuyomi-2000664583</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Kazuma Kaneko, the legendary “Demon Designer” and art director behind the </span><i><span>Shin Megami Tensei </span></i><span>series, every mainline </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game and, most recently,</span><i><span> Metaphor: ReFantazio</span></i><span>, has just revealed his new card game with AI-generated card art, </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span>. Like with the earlier game </span><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span>, Kaneko isn’t just involved in aspects like game concept and character design but actually appears in-game, or at least an AI recreation of him does.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Coming from mobile game developer Colopl, it’s set to land on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on April 23, and it’ll cost you $24.99. Or roughly $640, if you want to shell out for the special “Shinma Artist Box” edition.</span></p> <p><span>This reveal was made alongside the announcement that Colopl’s previous free-to-play partnership with Kaneko, </span><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span>, will be coming to a close on April 22 (a day before the release of </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span>). This was all announced during a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzuen_-vCa8"><span>livestreamed event</span></a><span> on Colopl’s official YouTube last night.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span> allowed players to create their own AI artwork cards through the use of its “AI Kaneko” mechanic. The in-game Kazuma Kaneko would analyze players’ playstyles and gift them AI-generated cards, based on a library of Kaneko’s work. </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span> won’t feature the same mechanic, but will instead port 3,600 of the developer’s favourite AI Kaneko-produced cards over to the new version of the game.</span></p> <p><span>We know this because a Colopl representative reached out to </span><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/kazuma-kanekos-tsukuyomi-announced-for-switch"><i><span>Gematsu</span></i></a> <span>to clarify: “The Switch version takes a curated amount of those AI generated cards from the previous game and includes them in the new game. The Switch version does not include the generative AI model to create new cards beyond the cards that the team has put into the Switch version.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Worse still, as noted by </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shin-megami-tensei-artist-kazuma-kanekos-free-to-play-ai-card-game-to-end-services-and-immediately-resurrect-as-full-price-nintendo-switch-exclusive/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>, the official </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span> website states that the “game uses generative AI in the creation of images, videos, and music.” The same statement says that the devs will “strive to prevent unauthorised use and rights infringement,” but it’s still confirmation that generative AI tools are being used in almost every facet of this game’s development.</span></p>

<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.1.3.6</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team shared news of major updates that not only address regular quality-of-life improvements but also address reliability issues and gameplay flow.</p>



<p>The update, scheduled to go live on February 3, addresses issues in REDSEC Battle Royale related to parachute behavior, insertions, and other redeploy UI elements.</p>



<p>Another major update listed is a fix to player movement issues, including excessive Sprint jumps and unintended movements. It is emphasized that this will not affect movement on a large scale but will address the specific issues reported by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-coming-to-battlefield-6-in-new-updates">Map and Mode Fixes Coming to Battlefield 6 in New Updates</h2>



<p>Map and mode issues are also addressed. Three issues related to Eastwood have been fixed. First, the issue of drawing a building near the A flag, which caused unintended green and purple visual effects, has been addressed. Also, the issue where destroying the B flag could potentially cause a blackout has been fixed.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update addresses a PlayStation 5 issue where ownership validation failed during system events, causing connectivity problems. Plus, the update has resolved an out-of-memory crash on Xbox Series S when loading Daily and Weekly Challenges.</p>







<p>Other issues related to the Battle Royale mode and other areas have been addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2017266697183412713">here</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been a few years since the last Nioh game. Team Ninja has been sharpening its blades and skills with other projects, but it’s time for the company’s main Soulslike to return. The latest information on Nioh 3’s early access is interesting.</p>



<p>The question of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nioh3.jpg" id="147929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh</a> being the best non-<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/fromsoftware/" id="87617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware</a> series rages on. The Nioh franchise is dripping in Yokai-infested excellence, and each game is more refined than the last. Nioh 3 has gone bigger and bolder with its open-world approach, and it’s no wonder that so many of you want it now.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-there-nioh-3-early-access">Is There Nioh 3 Early Access?</h2>

<p><strong>Team Ninja is not offering early access as an incentive for Nioh 3 early adopters.</strong></p>



<p>Why should people who pay a bit more get to see those game-over screens sooner? This is the motto for Nioh 3, as even though the game has multiple editions, none of them feature an early access bonus.</p>



<p>There <em>are </em>cool perks, such as a Season Pass and exclusive gear, but you get to use them on Nioh 3’s launch day—like everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-nioh-3-have-a-demo">Does Nioh 3 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>If you simply need to play Nioh 3 before release, there is a lengthy demo you can download for free on all applicable gaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no Xbox version of Nioh 3, sadly, but if you are on PC or PS5, you can download a free demo to give you a fairly hefty look at the game, how it plays, and if it’s for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-download-nioh-3-demo">How To Download Nioh 3 Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Go to the PlayStation Store or Steam, search for Nioh 3, and you can buy and download the free Nioh 3 demo.</strong></p>



<p>Thousands of players have already left glowing reviews for the Nioh 3 demo. If you want to try it yourself, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decide if you’re playing on PlayStation 5 or PC.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store on PS5 or Steam for PC.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Nioh 3 Demo</strong>.</li>



<li>Add it to your library on either format.</li>



<li>Once it’s finished downloading, you can get stuck in!</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s even more good news for you: Your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-demo-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3 demo progress will carry over to the full game</a>. It’s the equivalent of starting the full game and making a dent in potential progress.</p>



<p>Will the Nioh 3 demo keep you going until February 6? Or are you going to replay an older Nioh or wait patiently for the third game in the meantime?

<p>“It’s a net positive to instil that fear"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="565241a6496cf"><a title="Yoko Kamiya" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/565241a6496cf/yoko-kamiya.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/photo">Nintendo Life / Square Enix / Hideki Kamiya</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>In a recent episode of Cafe Four Leaf on CLOVERS' YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR</a> creator Yoko Taro has heaped praise on fellow game developer and friend Hideki Kamiya and his approach to gamers online who "say things seriously out of line." (Thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hes-a-net-positive-for-the-game-industry-nier-creator-yoko-taro-on-why-hideki-kamiyas-famous-social-media-blocking-sprees-actually-work-i/">Automaton</a>.)</p>
<p>Kamiya — the veteran game director who is currently working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/okami-sequel-announced-will-be-directed-by-hideki-kamiya">an <strong>Okami</strong> sequel</a> following his departure from PlatinumGames <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/hideki-kamiya-is-leaving-platinumgames">in 2023</a> — is infamous for taking no prisoners on social media, blocking people on a whim and replying in kind when someone disrespects him.</p>
<p>Where other developers are more diplomatic and retiring online, Kamiya has a history of getting stuck in and giving as good as he gets, an approach that Taro finds inspiring and which "makes Kamiya-san a great guy to have in your corner."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you’re a game creator and you're a public-facing personality, you draw attention from a lot of people, including some real weirdos. Some of them say things that are seriously out of line. Just very nasty stuff. And because they're your audience and your customers, you can’t really clap back with full force. Unless you're Kamiya-san. "Go away, you insect!" [laughs]</p>
<p>Just like how some people in real life will tell you off if you provoke them, I think it’s a net positive to instil that fear that there are some game creators who do have that edge, so be careful how you treat us. [...] That’s why I think having you around is super reassuring as one of your industry peers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"A lot of people assume we’ll sit there and be their punching bags," Kamiya agreed, "and if we suddenly sock them one, they're stunned."</p>

<p>Taro also talks about how the way Kamiya acts online is very different to his in-person demeanour or how he is in the workplace. "There's how you behave on X, there's who you are at work, and there's the version of you that's shy around people. There's a huge disconnect between those three aspects of your personality."</p>
<p>Kamiya has had some fun with his online reputation in the past - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/02/random_back_the_wonderful_101_remaster_on_kickstarter_and_get_blocked_by_hideki_kamiya">one of the rewards</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wonderful_101_remastered">Wonderful 101</a> Kickstarter campaign was to get blocked by him. He has also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/hideki-kamiya-expresses-remorse-over-harsh-treatment-of-kami-fan">expressed regret</a> over some of his responses, but as these creators mention in the video, navigating the volume — size <em>and</em> loudness — of the "nasty stuff" sent their way on a daily basis must be a challenge.</p>
<p>The whole episode is only 15 minutes long and covers other topics in a very relaxed environment (weekly episodes are planned, and this one was filmed in Korea rather than at Clovers' Japanese studio), so if your only experience of Kamiya is his games and his social media persona, take a look at the series and enjoy hearing him discuss games and other wide-ranging topics, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F13YDNNOKNg">model kits</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbttSAGcs2s">mesh underwear</a>.</p>

            <p>Are you more of a supervan wrecker or a bone stock maniac? Can you be best described as a British couch racing champion, or is your calling more in the realms of Finnish folk? These are the sorts of questions you'll have to pose to yourself whenever you fire up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>'s still-in-the works career mode, which devs Bugbear Entertainment have just laid out a bunch of plans for.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/492715550584078981">lengthy dev blog</a> in which they've done so is an estimate 10 to 20 minute read, so I'm going to have to get my summary pants on. Basically, Bugbear reckon a lot of racing game career modes - the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a>'s included - fall into the trap of following pretty samey structure. You start off with a slow car, you complete all the events, you end up with many fast cars.</p>
<p>So, with the fact different players come to Wreckfest with different types of wheeled mayhem in mind, the second game's career mode is designed to cater to you deciding where you fit into three broad player profiles. Folks who want to do regular clean racing is the first, demolition derby and contact-heavy racing buffs make up the second, and the third's a wild card of sorts dubbed "The Bonebreaker". The last group prioritise fun mucking about above all else, via the likes of "ridiculous vehicle scenarios". The last time you had a race that was lawnmowers vs motorised toilets vs motorhomes. Yeah, that.</p>
<p>Those three profiles break down even further into this monstrosity:</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bugbear / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From the sounds of it, rather than being locked into one alignment, you'll be able to choose what you want to focus on every time you fire up the career mode. Depending on what you pick, you'll be working on progressing up the ranks in the mode's four divisions: European Racing, Demolition Derby, Banger Racing, and American Racing. Each of those boasts three or four difficulty/complexity tiers, and progressing up through them doesn't just revolve around winning every event. Here's how Bugbear explain what you'll do to move up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each division features a collection of accomplishments, and to meet their requirements, you need to accumulate enough of specific type of score across those events. While the exact way to earn score varies depending on the discipline and game mode, here's the beautiful part: at the end of the day you decide how to earn that score and which events to play.</p>
<p>This is now getting into the nitty-gritty details but to illustrate our point, let's use a practical example. Imagine an accomplishment called 'Finnish Folk Racing Champion' that requires 10,000 points of racing score across six available events. A skilled racer might earn those points in just three events by winning and getting a bonus by posting fastest laps. A player who's less skilled at racing but enjoys the challenge might need to complete four or five events finishing somewhere mid-pack. Someone who sucks at racing but really loves drifting might earn points by finishing near the back of a race but throwing their car sideways in style.</p></blockquote>
<p>In line with that, the sort of things that score you points change depending on the type of event you're in. Racing-focused events, reward high finishing positions and fast laps. Contact-focused events balance those with congratulating you on crumpling fenders. Demo derbies only car about how good you done crashed up your foes.</p>
<p>It all sounds pretty good to me, assuming each section of the mode is equally fleshed out so that one segment of Wreckfest 2's chaotic evils doesn't feel a bit shortchanged.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-fixes-cosmetics-a-month-after-ai-slop-allegations-2000664576</link>
            <guid>1421137</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back in December, <em>Battlefield 6</em> came under fire for releasing cosmetics that appeared to be made at least partly with generative AI. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167">As<em> Kotaku</em> reported at the time</a>, EA was aware of the issue and trying to investigate the cause throughout the winter break. Were players right to freak out? EA isn’t saying. The closest we’re getting to an answer is a new patch that changes some of the in-game items accused of being slop.</p> <p>“Updated the Objective Ace and Winter Warning cosmetics to better align with <em>Battlefield</em>’s visual identity,” reads one of the changelog notes for Friday’s <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2017266697183412713">1.1.3.6 <em>Battlefield 6</em> update</a>. The company doesn’t go into any further detail about what was changed and why, but players immediately connected it back to last month’s Christmas week controversy.</p>

 <p>The original backlash came when players noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pt4ihv/multi_billion_dollar_company_ea_selling_ai/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167">an M4A1 emblem</a> from the winter cosmetic pack that EA was selling had two barrels. That sparked an investigation of other recent additions to the game for anything that looked vaguely off, including a bear that seemed to have extra claws. Some fans also criticized EA in early January for the Objective Ace operator mask that looked very similar to that worn by <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s Ghost.</p> <p>How could such a glaring rip-off make it into the game? Once again, some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pzqhui/this_is_litteraly_a_cod_ghosts_mask/">blamed the use of genAI</a>. <em>Kotaku</em> reported last month that one of the potential issues had to do with the sheer volume of content promised for <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s launch and beyond. Without proper resources and quality checks, junk could make it into the game in any number of ways. <em>Call of Duty</em> has had its own challenges with genAI garbage <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">slipping through as well</a>.</p>

 <p>Despite EA CEO Andrew Wilson’s embrace of emerging AI technology to fundamentally reshape the company, EA VP Rebecka Coutaz, who oversees DICE and the other teams making&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the BBC</a> last year that no genAI would make it into the final game. She didn’t promise, however, that it wasn’t being used at all during the development process. EA is currently set to be <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">sold to Saudi Arabia</a> and a group of other investors sometime this summer.</p>

<p>Fortnite is teasing a new collaboration with Mihoyo’s Honkai Star Rail.</p>



<p>Collaborations in Fortnite are always a big topic in the community, with players always looking at leaks and rumours for the next big crossover. At the moment, we are already seeing names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a> coming to the battle royale title. Now, it seems another popular game is on its way. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-next-collaboration-is-with-honkai-star-rail">Fortnite’s Next Collaboration is With Honkai Star Rail</h2>



<p>Epic Games Store has posted a new image on <a href="https://x.com/EpicGames/status/2017251729411342790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) featuring two swords and the caption, “Who’s trailblazing their way to Fortnite.” Excited fans in the comments have already started making their guesses in the comments, with most of them shouting Fortnite x Honkai Star Rail. Moreover, a reliable Fortnite leaks source, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/2017253289742471217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, has confirmed that the collaboration is indeed with Mihoyo’s free-to-play gacha adventure. </p>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans in the comments have also deciphered who these swords belong to in the game. The gold and black sword seemingly belongs to Blade, and the katana with the red blade appears to belong to Kafka. Due to these two swords being showcased, fans are speculating that it could be these two characters that make it to Fortnite in the next collab. However, this hasn’t been officially confirmed by the devs. </p>

<figure data-uuid="4db6e1d06fee4"><a title="The Hilltop Funeral" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4db6e1d06fee4/the-hilltop-funeral.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: BROKENCIGS</em></figcaption></figure><p>Behind every game is an untold story, and <strong>The Hilltop Funeral</strong> is no exception. From adjusting to remote collaboration to having their entire game concept scooped, the team at BROKENCIGS has gone through no shortage of hardships in developing their diabolical co-op coffin carrier.</p>
<p>The Hilltop Funeral, which is currently available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3553350/The_Hilltop_Funeral/">early access on Steam</a>, sees two players piloting pallbearers carrying a corpse in a coffin to a funeral home. Tricky levels and puzzles require tight coordination to overcome while keeping the lifeless ragdoll body in its open casket. This gameplay is paired with a Tim Burton-esque art style, goofy dialogue teeming with dark humour, and a surprising story the developers are keeping tight-lipped about until the game’s proper release.</p>
<p>After letting us in on news that the game will receive Switch and Switch 2 versions, we sat down with director <strong>Luke Li</strong> and lead developer <strong>Cindy Fan</strong> to learn more about the game, their journey, and the realities of modern-day indie game development.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Tim Rattray): This may be the first time readers are hearing about BROKENCIGS and its games. Who are you and your studio?</strong></p>
<figure data-uuid="ad321120908dc"><a title="BROKENCIGS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad321120908dc/brokencigs.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Luke (left), Cindy (second from left), and the team at GDC — <em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://brokencigs.com/about-us">BROKENCIGS</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Luke Li:</strong> I’m Luke, the director and lead game designer on The Hilltop Funeral, and we are BROKENCIGS. We’re a New York-based indie game studio founded two years ago. We create games based on our passion and what we like to reflect our team of diverse individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Cindy Fan:</strong> Hi, I’m Cindy, the lead developer and a designer. First of all, Luke, we formed our company three years ago, because it’s now 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> Oh damn, it’s already been three years?</p>
<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> It’s scary to think about.</p>
<p><strong>It’s interesting that you noted your New York roots, as it’s not a city that often comes up in talks of game development. Why choose to move there from China to develop your games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> For indie developers in New York, people are more focused on working on something they feel they can express themselves with. I’ve always felt that working on your own game meant that you’re using it as a medium to say what you want to say, expressing your own creativity and ideas.</p>
<p>I’m not saying Chinese indie developers are not doing that because I don’t know a whole lot of them, but with the games [they’re submitting to] publishers, it feels like a lot of the time people are just trying to make something that’s going to blow up. And they keep doing that over and over, trying to make something that is in a popular genre and seeing if it all works, instead of making the game they want to do.</p>
<p>With us, coming from China to work on indie games in America, the publisher [Wise Games] believed we could perfectly combine our culture, identities, and backgrounds as Chinese people with our experience doing game development in New York, resulting in something even better.</p>
<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> Where I live in Florida, there are few game developer events [unlike the many found in New York City]. Once you leave New York City, you realise how precious they were to you.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4b8721487295c"><a title="The Hilltop Funeral" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b8721487295c/the-hilltop-funeral.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: BROKENCIGS</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>That move happened during the development of The Hilltop Funeral, right? How did you adapt to remote work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> Back when I first moved to Florida, I felt a lot of pressure being the only team member not in New York. It was back when we first formed the studio, and I had this feeling of, “Maybe they will kick me out.” I moved to Florida because one, the rent in New York is too expensive, and two, my partner is here studying at university. I had zero friends and felt that pressure of thinking I might get kicked out, so for the first few months it was really hard.</p>
<p>We have this thing when we’re working where we have individual Discord voice channels that we stay in while working. So, you can hop into another person’s channel to chat with them. Once we figured that out, it felt pretty similar to being in person where I could turn around and talk to Luke. Now that we’re used to that workflow, it’s become much easier — for me, at least — to adapt to remote work.</p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> Yeah, it’s all interconnected here. There are so many events happening by <a href="https://playcrafting.com/">Playcrafting</a>, <a href="https://gumbonyc.org/">GUMBO</a>, <a href="https://wondervilleprojects.org/">Wonderville</a>, and others. Slowly, you realise that it’s a small but big circle of game developers in New York, since you meet someone at a random gaming event and find out they also go to this other thing you also attend often. It feels good to be a part of this community, whether it’s <a href="https://www.os-nyc.com/">Indie Game Dev Night</a> or <a href="https://www.gamedevsofcolor.org/">Game Devs of Color Expo</a>. Every time we go to these events, it feels like you’re part of it right away and that really makes us feel like we’re making the right choice to be working on our dream games and pushing ourselves forward in a city that’s full of so many talented people, resources, and opportunities.</p>
<p>When we founded BROKENCIGS, it was recommended that we should found it in Delaware because of tax incentives. We were like, “That makes sense, but having your studio in New York, that’s so much cooler.” We are a New York studio, and it feels better [to be based here]. It turns out we made the right decision because without doing that, we would have missed out on so many opportunities that support New York-based teams only. We were really honoured to attend Tokyo Game Show with Empire State Development.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fe0a79ebd9d4c"><a title="The Hilltop Funeral" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe0a79ebd9d4c/the-hilltop-funeral.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: BROKENCIGS</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about the game. How did its development come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> [Our friend] Sam, Hailey — one of our artists — and I did a small project back in school that was very physics-based. It was sort of similar to what we have right now. What happened was that at the beginning of last year when we were working on Inkression, which is our 'main' game, we were very focused on trying to find it a publisher. During that time, we thought it’d be nice to take a little breather and work on something that’s lower pressure. We were feeling a lot of pressure with Inkression because the story is very serious, so we thought, let’s focus on something that’s more goofy, stupid, funny, and smaller in scope.</p>
<p>So, we got in touch with Sam and told him, “Hey, we had this idea back in the day and we want to restart it and turn it into an actual thing. Would you like to work on this together?” He gladly agreed.</p>
<p><strong>Right, the game is a collaboration between two studios, yours and Sam’s [Fumigawa Studios]. This seems challenging given that most team members now work remotely.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> There’s something incredibly encouraging about working with people outside our immediate team. They inject new character and insight into the project, opening doors we might not have seen otherwise. Of course, the challenge is finding the right balance. Every studio has its own priorities, and it's our responsibility to manage that partnership with empathy. It’s about finding that sweet spot where the game flourishes, but no one — on either side — burns out.</p>

<p><strong>One of the greatest obstacles you faced in the development of The Hilltop Funeral was having the idea scooped by a few other games.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> It’s really funny because we had the idea, and for years we didn’t touch on it. The moment we decided to start making it, we started seeing all these similar games, like one where you carry a sleepy king. There was this one game that’s exactly like ours in that you’re carrying a dead body inside a coffin, but the gameplay is very different.</p>
<figure data-uuid="94a5bc57a7bdb"><a title="Playcrafting “Indie Game Dev Night”" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/94a5bc57a7bdb/playcrafting-lindie-game-dev-nightr.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Luke (right) and Isamu ('Sam') Nakagawa (second from right) from Fumigawa Studios talking with former Avalanche developer Hamish Young (left) — <em><span></span> Image: Tim Rattray</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s funny because the moment you see a game that’s very similar to the one you’re working on that you thought was original, you do feel a little intimidated. But we went to play all these games, and it turned out each’s gameplay was somewhat different. At least, our game is innovative in the gameplay options it offers the players. In a lot of these other games — and it’s going to sound like I’m talking s**t — it’s a lot more about platforming instead of balancing [the coffin]. Our game is a platformer, but the key is that you have to lift the four corners of the coffin and balance the corpse inside.</p>
<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> And we also have the dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> It adds flavour. The two characters have a really interesting dynamic which has been the key highlight to many, many [early access] players. They might complain about the level being too hard or the corpse being too floaty, but they all like the little dialogues these two characters have along the way. It’s very fitting for the vibe and art style we’re trying to go for.</p>
<p><strong>Cindy, what is it about the dialogue that stands out to you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> It’s somewhat similar to <strong>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</strong> where when you fail, he says something provocative or kinda stupid. You tone down the frustration by having funny dialogue. The dialogue also shows up when you’re playing, not just when you fail. Because — and not in a bad way — the game is kind of repetitive since you’re trying to do the same task over and over, having that dialogue really adds to the fun.</p>
<p>Also, when translating the game to Chinese, there are some jokes that only work in English. So, I need to replace them with Chinese jokes with a similar vibe.</p>

<p><strong>The game is being developed for PC first, but with the Switch version in mind. Are there any challenges you’re anticipating in porting The Hilltop Funeral to Switch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> One thing I’m a little worried about is the aspect ratio. Our artists are really inspired by old movies, so they want the game to be in 4:3. This was forced onto players in older versions, but then we realized that a lot of players—including streamers—wanted to play in 16:9. I feel like we cannot do 4:3 on Switch because it’s already a small screen [in handheld mode].</p>
<p>I think some developers do have different-sized UI fonts for playing in handheld versus docked, so that’s something we also need to consider, especially if we’re going to do something like [a race mode we’re working on] where there are going to be eight players on-screen competing with each other.</p>
<p>Something I want to do is using the Joy-Con’s motion controls to lift the coffin. That would be challenging as well, since I know that’s harder to manipulate than just pressing the trigger buttons.</p>
<p><strong>To me, the game feels like it’s designed for couch co-op with Joy-Con.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> Yeah. A lot of the time when working on this game, I was thinking about college days when my friends and I sat on my couch using a super small monitor to play Overcooked, Super Smash Bros., and other co-op games on Switch. So, I can still picture people sitting there, playing this together, trying to balance and carry the corpse through a level. On a computer, it’s harder to get people sitting together for local co-op.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any differences between the Switch 1 and 2 versions? And when do you anticipate the game releasing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> Aside from a graphics and resolution upgrade [on Switch 2], we will have to see if the Switch version is able to support the eight-player mode. It could be taxing on the hardware, as our maps for those are quite a lot bigger than the normal modes. The basic modes will all be there on Switch, though.</p>
<p>We’re looking to release the full 1.0 release [on PC] later this year, with the Switch port happening in the first half of next year.</p>

<p><strong>To sign off, let’s ask the burning question: what’s your favourite Switch game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> My favourite Switch games would have to be the two Legend of Zeldas! I think I spent more than 600 hours on each one. I really love the environment design and how the games utilise players' curiosity and guide them to specific locations on the map where events and quests happen. That feeling of discovery is very inspiring to me as a game designer.</p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> It’s hard to pick a single favourite when my college years were defined by the chaos of Mario Kart and Smash in my tiny living room. But Animal Crossing will always hold a special place in my heart. It gave us a world to inhabit together during the pandemic, offering a space to hang out and find joy when the physical world felt so far away.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Thank you to Cindy and Luke for taking the time to speak with us.</em></p>
<p><em>They also wanted us to let Nintendo Life readers know that they also plan to bring their marquee game <strong>Inkression</strong> — which uses tattoo art to explore the stories of a dying gentrified neighbourhood — to the Switch. A demo for that game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2965930/Inkression/">available on Steam</a>.</em></p>

            <p>17-year Bethesda Bruce Nesmith veteran has given his take on a future Elder Scrolls Morrowind Remakes, stating he doubts the company even has the source code any more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout">In an interview with PressboxUK</a>, Nesmith spoke at length about the company and various projects he worked on. Having left in 2021 during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s development, he offered a frank response when asked why Bethesda would be hesitant to remake the old but beloved RPG.</p>
<p>The problem with doing Morrowind is that I bet they don't have the original code," Nesmith said. "The game is so old. I don't know if the original source code exists anymore. If it does, can you even compile it? When you're looking at Oblivion, they still had the code. They could still compile it. Putting the code into the new version of the engine was a possibility."</p>

<p>He also raised concerns around how Morrowind has aged, doubting that audiences would even enjoy playing that game today. "The other thing I would say is go back and play Morrowind and tell me that's the game you want to play again. We all have these fond memories of things that were pivotal moments in our gaming fantasy histories that we absolutely move but you go back and play a 20 year old game and you will cringe.</p><p>"People even had cringe moments with the Oblivion remake but they forgave it because they're reliving something, they're enjoying the nostalgia. I worked on Oblivion. I'm even responsible for some of those cringe moments! The further back you go, the more that's going to be an issue. The reality of playing Morrowind would not stand the test of time, in my opinion."</p>
<p>Instead, Nesmith raises the point that time would be better spent making something new within the Morrowind setting. He told Pressbox: "Now if you were to completely remake Morrowind with the Skyrim engine, to try and rebuild it from the ground up, that's a whole other story, but that's an entire project. That's a whole four-year development cycle. Why not go and make something new?</p>
<p>"Let's revisit the lands of Morrowind and do a new story. You can include the giant crab palace and all of that stuff but make it new and avoid all the things that would not have survived the test of time."</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered, which released back in April of last year, proved exceptionally popular. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">It sold over four million copies in five days</a>, and received <a href="http://eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">numerous community mods</a> that both added some additional wackiness to the beloved RPG and smoothed off some of its rougher edges. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-asks-the-elder-scrolls-fans-to-suggest-oblivion-remastered-improvements-with-difficulty-scaling-among-top-ideas">Bethesda also went to the community for ideas to improve the game</a>, difficulty scaling one of the more popular among them.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">Eurogamer's Jim Trinca made a case for a Morrowind remake last year</a>, in which he argued: Morrowind is a special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly. I love it warts and all, as much as I love Oblivion warts and all, but I find the latter much easier to recommend for the simple fact that Oblivion is brilliant because of its quirks and foibles, whereas Morrowind is brilliant in spite of them.</p>
