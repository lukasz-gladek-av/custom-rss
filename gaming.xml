            <p>FromSoft has dropped a new tease about the "fearsome foes of unfathomable power" that await us when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree drops next month.</p>
<p>The image – which is about as hard to describe as the creature will inevitably be to beat – shows a muscular being with horned, uh, tendril things, a cracked golden mask for a face, and long grey hair flowing out of its right eye socket.</p>

<p>The face is particularly intriguing, as gold seems to be a key theme of Shadow of the Erdtree, and is seen pouring out of the large Erdtree in the main artwork, as well as in new spells. As Ed speculated earlier this week, we've been wondering if this may link to Miquella's Unalloyed Gold.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://x.com/PloybertCorti/status/1791550102781231596">others</a> have likened it to a woman's reproductive system, so make of that what you will.</p> <div>

<p>This latest tease follows last week's uncovering of "the abandoned and tragic who forage beneath the umbra pray for the embrace of a new master", which gave us another peek at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reveals-new-elden-ring-enemy-with-bloodborne-esque-design">new Elden Ring enemy with a glowing, bulbous head</a>.</p>
<p>The much-anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree releases on 21st June and is set to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">FromSoftware's largest expansion to date</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24155754/the-collage-atlas-interview-steam-hand-drawn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I couldn’t walk away from the pen and ink thing,” says John Evelyn, creator of <em>The Collage Atlas</em>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2581960%2FThe_Collage_Atlas%2F">a dreamlike storybook adventure recently released on Steam</a>. The entire game is hand drawn, from tiny flowers and insects to huge buildings and the clouds that float over them. Exploring this world unwraps its dreamlike story, with environments folding out in response to your approach.</p><p>“I had been drawing for many years before that […] and I’d always draw with ink straight away, without any kind of prior pencil work or sketching,” he says. “I liked all the incidental details and the accidents that come out along the way.” He compares it to improv music — “actually, sometimes it goes horribly wrong!” — but says that the feeling of getting into a stride and being surprised by unexpected outcomes was important to the whole game.</p><p>It’s because of this that the art style underpins the rest of the experience. Where individual pieces of game art can fall into the background, <em>The Collage Atlas</em> requests your attention to detail — and rewards it. At the very start of the game, a pinwheel appears from a grassy plain; look at it, and it begins spinning. It was one of the first things that Evelyn created, for what was originally an app meant to accompany a picture book.</p><p>The book, a follow-up to a self-published work called <em>Asleep As The Breeze</em>, was intended to explore themes of agency and the feeling of disempowerment that can come from traumatic or chaotic life experiences. “You can start to feel like life is something that’s kind of happening to you rather than something that you have meaningful control or authorship of,” says Evelyn.</p><p>While experimenting with that theme, “everything clicked into place,” when the pinwheel spun, he says. “It suddenly made sense that, actually, this was the crux of what I was trying to talk about. That, actually, even when it doesn’t feel like it, just your presence within the world is genuinely meaningful and actually does have an impact on it. Even your gaze and your observation is also meaningful.”</p><div><p>“Even your gaze and your observation is also meaningful.”</p></div><p>Evelyn built on the app idea for a short art experience, which he exhibited at the Leftfield Collection at UK gaming convention EGX in 2016. At the time, he says, he had no intention of continuing to expand it into a game that would eventually make it to Apple Arcade and then Steam. Instead, he says, it was “something that I personally felt like I really needed to do.”</p><p>“I had gone through a pretty bad run of years,” he says, “and I was finding it difficult to find media that spoke to me about the things I was experiencing.” Other media seemed deeply specific to others’ situations, whereas Evelyn wanted something broader. “Things that just nudge at universal themes I find really useful.”</p><p>At the show, people connected with his piece. In particular, Evelyn was swayed by the attention of “business-type people,” who would ask him how long the full game would end up being. “In my mind, I was like, ‘Oh, do you actually think that people would want that?’” He says he was swayed by them because, if they were coming at it from a “fairly cold financial standpoint” and thought there would be an audience for it, he might be able to believe it himself.</p><div><p><cite>Image: John William Evelyn</cite></p></div><p>He knew that he wanted the experience to be something that could “slowly absorb you” — meaning a couple of hours, rather than 10 minutes. For the next four years, he threw everything at filling out that scope. Although he had experience and knowledge from a career that included time making Flash games, working in freelance illustration, and releasing music EPs, he also had a lot to learn. “The day that I started <em>The Collage Atlas</em> as it is now, not the little demo version, that was the very first day I opened up [game engine] Unity,” he says.</p><p>In order to convert illustrations to 3D, a process he had never done before, he began by creating the models in Unity before printing their maps and drawing in the details with pen. Once scanned back in, those textures were readded to the model to create the world of <em>The Collage Atlas</em> and everything that makes it up.</p><div><p>“Works don’t have any kind of permanence — they can just vanish.”</p></div><p>After nearly five years of work, in 2020, the game was released on Apple Arcade, but in 2023 it was delisted when the exclusivity period ended. Not long afterward, even people who had downloaded it weren’t able to launch it. “This is the sad thing about the way our kind of creative mediums are going: works don’t have any kind of permanence — they can just vanish,” he says. Evelyn felt he owed it to his past self who did all that work to make sure the game was still available and recently launched it on Steam.</p><p>After the game’s Apple Arcade release, Evelyn thought he might be done working on games. “I spoke to one of my friends who’s a AAA developer and I said, ‘That’s it. That’s me done. I’m never doing this again.’ He said, ‘I’ll give you six months.’” Almost exactly six months later, he started working on his next game, <em>The Wings of Sycamore</em>. Also hand-drawn, it’s something of a spiritual sequel to <em>The Collage Atlas</em>.</p><p>“<em>Atlas</em> is trying to explore the idea of falling inwards,” he says. “<em>Wings of Sycamore</em> is about flight. After you manage to climb back out of the depths, hopefully, that’s when you just have the pure joy of flying.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="nhNFDz">Something that makes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24078257/best-tv-2024-shows-series">television amazing</a> is how it can build stories across hours, months, and years, expand whole worlds into deep and intense narratives, and beam it right into our homes, our brains. Something else incredible about TV is how sometimes the only thing people remember is the ending. </p>
<p id="f5uXJg">The whiplash of possibilities has never been clearer than on <a href="https://polygon.com/game-of-thrones"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>. For all the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/20/18632992/game-of-thrones-finale-ratings-hbo-season-8">record-breaking ratings</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/9/22/20879089/game-of-thrones-best-drama-emmys-2019-awards">awards</a>, and dramatic highs, the HBO series is still the modern shorthand for “didn’t stick the landing.” After all those ambitious battles on horseback, five years <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/22/18634730/game-of-thrones-finale-explained-references-callbacks">after the finale</a>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ lasting legacy can feel like that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1492985-game-of-thrones">half-drawn horse</a> — but viewers saddled up for a reason </p>
<p id="6iphCz">In season 1, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss’ drew in fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23200605/game-of-thrones-books-ending-winds-of-winter-george-r-r-martin-song-ice-fire">George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series</a> — and millions of newcomers — with meticulously sprawling political plots, complicated characters, and even a whodunnit. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/25/18638407/best-episodes-list-seasons">Abruptly axing Ned Stark</a> in the penultimate episode made the game of <em>Game of Thrones</em> clearer than ever: You win. Or you die. </p>
<p id="xZwX8N">Into season 2, Benioff and Weiss wielded the bombastic stakes set down by the books. In Martin’s world, no fantasy trope was ever neat, and it was rarely simple. The beautiful girl noticed by the prince found herself in a horror story; the boy king was either malevolent or misguided, with no Merlin to bail him out. <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ inversions grew like vines, constantly spreading and weaving together to more and more complicated patterns. Success was debatable — even fans questioned the nuance of the Lannisters, or the fraught sexposition that the show often employed for exposition-heavy scenes — but the tendrils of the HBO show made it flush and sturdy, even if things in Meereen floundered a bit. </p>
<p id="7Wo91K">Still, it’s no wonder that the second the roots of <em>Game of Thrones </em>felt too overgrown, people turned on it. Frustrated fans waited years (or decades, for book stans) for a fitting conclusion to what felt like <em>the</em> modern epic. After all the unflinching gambles, with so many threads to pull at, a truncated season 8 was never going to tie everything together with a neat bow.<strong> </strong>Viewers issued every kind of complaint after the finale aired on May 19, 2019, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/5/18/18627983/game-of-thrones-season-8-petition-rewrite-star-wars">a petition to reshoot the whole final season</a> all together. Then culture just kind of shuffled along. <em>Game of Thrones</em> became another major tentpole that, in its best days, felt like a true marriage of culture and commerce, and suddenly no one <em>really</em> wanted to talk about anymore. </p>
<p id="3jf5k5">But the industry did; before the show was even over, producers were already looking for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/5/21/18634070/new-game-of-thrones-show-witcher-lord-of-the-rings-tv-star-wars-series">“the next <em>Game of Thrones</em>.”</a> The folly of that search for monoculture in the streaming era isn’t even the true legacy of the series; whether you liked it or not, <em>Thrones</em> is the skeleton key to the next era of TV, according to those living it. Five years after the finale, Polygon reached out to a handful of showrunners and directors to understand the <em>Game of Thrones</em> ripple effect, and how they feel the industry might still  be learning from it.  </p>

<h2 id="DYjnL0"><strong>What drew us in</strong></h2>
<h4 id="FHUAc8">
<strong>Matt Shakman (director on </strong><em><strong>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, WandaVision, The Great</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="XzmVT1">That show changed everyone’s idea of what TV could do. </p>
<p id="T24tK6">Before I went to work on that show, I sat down with David Nutter — who is a wonderful filmmaker who had done the Red Wedding and many episodes — and he said, “You’re about to get the keys to the best Porsche that’s ever been built. And all they want you to do is put your pedal to the metal.” And it was this sense of: you have a huge playground, go have fun, and dream big and they’ll be there to support you. And that certainly had not been the experience in TV before, where things were done quickly, where you were sort of cutting corners, and that movie scope of what <em>Game of Thrones</em> was bringing hadn’t been done before. And now I think there’s an opportunity at so many places.</p>
<h4 id="cxqq5Z">
<strong>Naren Shankar (co-showrunner of </strong><em><strong>The Expanse, Almost Human</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="ysL0hp">I came to <em>Game of Thrones</em> only through the show, I’d never read the book. And so literally every step of the way, every moment of the show, the shocks hit me like big shocks. Literally up to the moment when the ax fell on Ned Stark’s neck, I was like, <em>There’s no way he can die</em>. And then the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24133430/fallout-wedding-scene-bloody-red-wedding-trope-history">Red Wedding</a> — that probably fucked me up for, like, weeks; “The Mountain and the Viper,” same thing. I was so<em> disturbed</em> by it. And that’s the real power of the show. I had never seen anything like that. Shows had kind of walked up to it a little bit, but I don’t think anything hit or had the impact of that. </p>
<h4 id="e9lpG8">
<strong>Halley Feiffer (showrunner of </strong><em><strong>American Horror Story: Delicate</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="YDOHj4">I think I didn’t trust <em>Game of Thrones</em> at first without watching it because it was so universally beloved. I often feel like such an outlier that I assume I will not fall in love with the thing that everyone else does — and then almost always I find that I do, only now I’m just behind the eight ball. And my experience with <em>Game of Thrones</em> was: I kept meaning to get around to it. [But] I was in LA with my friend Pedro Pascal, and he said, “I have to tell you something. I just booked a role on <em>Game of Thrones,” </em>and I was like, “Shit now I have to start watching <em>Game of Thrones</em>!” </p>

<p id="Vf3G90">And then, of course, fell in love with it, for all the reasons I didn’t think I would. I loved fantasy as a kid (because humanity’s unbearable). And what I loved about <em>Game of Thrones</em> was, how amidst the fantasy, how real these characters were, and how surprisingly relatable their emotional arcs were, even in a fantastical atmosphere. And how incredibly moving the performances were. </p>
<h4 id="3uEF27">
<strong>Ronald D. Moore (creator of </strong><em><strong>Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, For All Mankind</strong></em><strong>)</strong><em><strong>  </strong></em>
</h4>
<p id="gnzTU6">At the end of the first season, it was clear that it was going to be a major television show. Whether it was successful or not, I just kind of knew this was something really different, and something that was going to change the way that, in particular, fantasy was done on TV — which, up until that point, had not had a lot of success in television. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/year-of-the-ring">The Lord of the Rings films</a> had broken box office records and were huge. But there hadn’t been a lot of fantasy on television that had actually gotten any traction. And so I knew kind of right away, this was something that was going to change that genre, pretty much permanently, for television going forward. </p>
<h4 id="fX2lit">
<strong>Rafe Judkins (showrunner of </strong><em><strong>The Wheel of Time</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="fq2rUI">I have a special experience with <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because one of my dearest friends in the world was a writer on it from season 1 — Bryan Cogman. And I also was a huge, huge fan of the books before the series was ever made. So it was interesting to see the moments in the show where even I was like, <em>Oh my God, this I wish it was the same as it was in the books</em>. Because you begin to realize that I think that there’s a part of you, if you do love a book series, that no matter how it’s being adapted, and no matter who it’s being adapted by, there is a small death involved, the death of how you read it and how you saw it in your mind, and how you experienced it and who was the star of the books when you read it. </p>
<h4 id="juG20d">
<strong>Rachel Kondo (co-creator of </strong><em><strong>Shōgun</strong></em><strong>) </strong>
</h4>
<p id="techG3">[<em>Thrones</em>] was my first experience with thinking outside the world of a show, and just being abundantly curious — I hadn’t read the book. And I didn’t know much about adaptation when it came to book-to-screen. So this is the first one that I had ever watched, like, behind-the-scenes things afterwards, and listened to the creators, and it was just many firsts for me. I hadn’t thought about those things before. </p>
<p id="lFp88d">We looked forward to our Sunday nights religiously; we were faithful for years and years to watch in that way. And I feel like <em>Shōgun</em> — I kind of took it for granted they were releasing it on a weekly basis in that old style. But the fact that so many people have told me — from every walk of life — <em>We’re going to miss our Tuesday nights with </em>Shōgun; it reminded me of why we so miss <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It just felt like it had kind of worked its way, wormed its way into our hearts and lives. It worked into the logistics of our lives; we planned around it.</p>
<h4 id="d92Qv5">
<strong>Justin Marks (co-creator of </strong><em><strong>Shōgun</strong></em><strong>) </strong>
</h4>
<p id="aNCS6c">I think that it created for itself an event; we didn’t want to miss it. Any movie or show that I was working on when <em>Game of Thrones</em> was out, that was Monday’s discussion. We would sit there and talk about that episode and what had come out, and you best not miss it. And I think that it was so primed for that, and it made it so rich, to have that excitement to feel like it was an enduring world that we were witnessing in real time. And nothing does that anymore.</p>
<p id="76ROy7">I don’t think there’s anything quite like the feeling I got during the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/3/8724839/game-of-thrones-hard-home">“Hardhome” sequence</a> of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It wasn’t the action — I mean, sure, that was wonderful and scary and interesting, and the score so endured in my head, too. It was the moment at the end where the Night King where he stands up as they’re as they’re riding out, and he looks back at Jon Snow after they’ve just endured such heavy losses to even survive what they were able to do, and he stares indifferently. I’ll never forget this: Watching as he gestures with his arms out, and the entire army is reanimated again. And it’s just, <em>This is what you’re up against when you’re coming up against death itself</em>. That has haunted me forever. It’s so silent, and so beautiful, and meditative. Show me something else on TV that’s come since that will equal that. I think it’s iconic. I watch it again, sometimes just to feel something the way that I felt that night when I watched it.</p>

<h4 id="VAXfwd">
<strong>David Goyer (creator of</strong><em><strong> Foundation,</strong></em><strong> co-creator of </strong><em><strong>The Sandman</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="2tbJRG">I’m friends with those guys, and putting aside whatever anyone thinks about season 8, I still think <em>Game of Thrones</em> is one of the greatest shows that’s ever been made. I think it completely changed the landscape of television. And it completely blew open the barn doors of what was possible — that you could tell a story over eight seasons, that you could tell a story that had 30 or 40 different characters, that it would be novelistic in its approach, that it would be a slow burn. And that’s the kind of show I like, those are the kinds of novels I like; so this adaptation of <em>Foundation</em> would not have been possible had that not happened. </p>
<h4 id="3DT3yA">
<strong>Karyn Kusama (director and executive producer on</strong><em><strong> Yellowjackets</strong></em><strong>, director on </strong><em><strong>Dead Ringers</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="x7BEFJ">It involved people in long-term conversations about the nature of power, and what that does to us. There have been other shows, completely unlike it, that also examine these themes, but for as much intrigue and kind of medieval soap as there was in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, there was also a long, slow burn toward really unpacking what I would call the derangement of power, like what becomes the derangement of oneself if you decide to claim power. </p>
<h2 id="rdSYxL"><strong>What kept us in the game</strong></h2>
<h4 id="KXb643"><strong>Halley Feiffer</strong></h4>
<p id="JR1zzI">It’s kind of the thing that I love in anything, whether it’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>, or this production of <em>Uncle Vanya</em> I saw last night, which is these moments between characters that feel both surprising and inevitable somehow, and the ways in which — especially in those first few seasons — these characters kept you on this tightrope between loving and loathing them. In one moment, you’re condemning their actions. And in the next moment, you’re hoping they commit more atrocities, if only to create this incredibly dynamic push pull within you, as it were, the way that it really kept you on your toes morally. That was something that I found incredibly exciting and complicated, and made me as a viewer feel implicated in the carnage in ways that felt very challenging, and almost impossible to recreate. But that means we want to keep coming back for more as a viewer, and I want to try to find my own version of that dramatic tension in my own work.</p>
<h4 id="R1aYbP"><strong>Rafe Judkins</strong></h4>
<p id="Crq9Em">I really loved Oberyn Martell in the show, and bringing that character in, and the way they adapted him and the way they brought him to the forefront even more so than he was in the books, let him really shine on the show and then exit in such a great moment. I felt like it was a really brilliant piece of adaptation because they contained the character really to one season where he could make the most impact, they devoted more screen time to him than you should to a character that’s going to die that season, and the devotion of that screen time really paid off. And I think it’s one of the most successful story arcs they had on the show. And I think that was in large part due to how they adapted it, and it was one that like you could see really lifted the story from the books into something even better for television.</p>
<p id="ecDWXJ">[And] the Red Wedding — I remember throwing the book to the floor, screaming, texting my mom, because I knew she was right around the same part of the book being like <em>What page are you on right now?</em> I remember that as being just this iconic moment in reading of the visceral, emotional reaction you had to it as a reader. And I think there was this interesting thing that happened with the show and an excellent work on the part of the adaptation, where the whole world had that response to the show. It’s a big part of why I think the show really took off, was that moment, and the creation of this visceral emotional response that sort of transcends the experience of watching television.</p>
<h4 id="GOdaPV"><strong>Justin Marks</strong></h4>
<p id="9vPVRo">There was a real feeling of confidence to the <em>Game of Thrones</em> narrative that was always at odds, in some sense, with what the audience expected and wanted, and I think that was really bold. The fact that all of us feel so free to loudly agree or disagree with the direction that the story would go at various times speaks to the quality of the narrative. After you’re out of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, I think you have to go back to <em>The Sopranos</em> to find a show that was as good at what <em>Game of Thrones</em> was. It never felt like once it got you addicted to one pace that it was going to stay on that pace. It was always willing to sort of flash us the middle finger and use that expectation against us sometimes. I feel like <em>Game of Thrones</em> did a wonderful job of saying: You don’t deserve anything other than what we offer you. You’re just kind of putty in our hands. And I think that’s what was so great, it was taking from the David Chase school of <em>I’m in control</em> that made a difference for me.</p>
<p id="adWqz9">The horizontality of the storytelling was really powerful to me. It went backwards to events that the show never deigned to ever show us. And whatever you want to call it — sexposition, horse-position, there was a lot of different versions of it in the show — it was handled in this way that ran at odds with what our expectations were sometimes for how stories should be told, and shown and not told. But it gave it a richness that made me feel like all of it was alive and rewarded multiple viewings. I remember with the Hound and the Mountain, how much they were sort of spoken about long before they’re ever together. And it’s like: look, you can engage that or not engage it, but it’s <em>there</em>, and it’s waiting for you. It becomes like some Dickens-like scale to the narrative and the world that just felt so alive. </p>

<p id="F1bila">It was the scope of it and the size of the production, how many characters and storylines there were, how well mounted it was in a production sense. It was visually arresting, and you really felt the world, right. It wasn’t just over in this one little kingdom over here doing a story, it had a very broad scope to the world. And it was a sweep, an epic sweep to the story that was really astonishing. </p>
<p id="KueEF2">I’m sure everybody talks about this, but: the moment they killed Ned... it was jaw dropping. I tend to watch TV with part of my brain thinking about the writing of it, the structure, and how they did this and that — and I didn’t see that coming in at all. Because you walk into the show, believing Sean Bean is the lead. If he’s gonna die, it’s gonna be the end of the season at best. But in the middle of the season like that, and the way they played that out it really was — I couldn’t really believe. And I was really impressed with just how bold that was in terms of storytelling.</p>

<p id="vvTn3j">It reminded me a lot of <em>Sopranos</em>, where there was a lot of things that the <em>Sopranos</em> characters did, the way they acted and the way the stories turned, that you just sort of went, <em>Well this is not how television is supposed to be, I can’t believe you’re gonna do that. I can’t believe you’re getting away with that</em>. And they both had a similar, just, kind of, bold quality, like: <em>Yeah, we’re gonna do it. And you know what, you’re gonna come back next week, and then watch it again</em>. </p>
<h4 id="QVUjlD"><strong>David Goyer</strong></h4>
<p id="ZGwrEh">Obviously, initially, for the first five seasons or so they had the books they were drafting off, but those characters just felt so much more three-dimensional to me than so many of the fantasy depictions I’d seen. My wife does not consider herself a fan of fantasy, but absolutely loved <em>Game of Thrones</em>. And so I think what’s important for us [as we work on <em>Foundation</em>] is that we really try to flesh out the interior lives of these characters. And as much as possible have the conflicts that they’re wrestling with feel universal, even though we’re dealing with the tropes of science fiction, and have the emotions and the dialogue not be laden down with too much sort of science fiction jargon. </p>

<p id="CaantW">I remember I had not read the Game of Thrones books, and a big science fiction/fantasy friend of mine; we would have dinner once a month, and he’d read all the books, and I think [I had] just finished the first season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> watching it. And he said, “You won’t think it now. But you will love Jaime Lannister.” And I said, <em>That’s just not possible! They just pushed this kid out of a window at the end of the first episode! there’s just no way that’s ever going to happen.</em> And he said, “I’m telling you, you’re wrong.” And I did love him; the guy’s involved in this incestuous relationship, and he, as far as he’s concerned, kills a child. And yet, by season 3, you fucking love the guy. And that was the best thing about <em>Game of Thrones</em> for me; you could take a character who you felt one way about, and slowly over the course of time, change the audience view. </p>
<h4 id="gjHCNX"><strong>Rachel Kondo</strong></h4>
<p id="Tiih71">It’s not outside of genre, it just transcends genre, right? It utilizes the best of what genre has and then finds a way to exist anew within it. How do you have spectacle but how do you sustain the care? It’s about surprise and inevitability, which the best stories really, really, really tried to strike that balance, or to achieve both at the same time. </p>
<p id="85q6yQ">You remember how you felt after [Battle of the Bastards], or Red Wedding — [<em>Shōgun</em>] didn’t quite have those moments. So for us, I would often think about those very very quiet interpersonal things on <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Like the moment Khaleesi gets Drogo to fall in love with her and look at her anew. You remember these things! And these very, very tiny moments. That’s what I was hoping we could somehow manufacture were these relationship moments you can’t forget just like you wouldn’t forget the battle scenes. </p>
<h4 id="z1MiuM"><strong>Matt Shakman</strong></h4>
<p id="0WIZut">The thing that <em>Game of Thrones</em> did do, and that we’re trying to do on <em>Monarch</em>, and I think all these shows that are succeeding on doing epic storytelling, is rooting it in character. It’s all about rooting for these characters, hoping they’ll survive, being curious where they’ll go. </p>
<h4 id="3SXAsk"><strong>Naren Shankar</strong></h4>
<p id="6dV7UU">I think more than anything — both as a viewer and as a writer, and someone who makes these shows — what <em>Game of Thrones</em> does so well is it blew up these tried and true dramatic concepts, where your protagonist essentially had plot armor; no matter how bad it was, you kind of knew they were going to get out of it, you kind of knew that, you know, good would triumph in the end. All of that kind of stuff that had, I think, just woven itself in the fabric of so many shows, the good guys win. And that was not always the case with <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I think shows talk about being the next <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but they don’t seem to want to quite embrace that same idea. And that, I think, is what still distinguishes the show. It has a fairly ruthless and remorseless harshness in some ways, but it’s all in the service of staying true to character and narrative reality that very few things really pull off. You’re taken into it with an understandable lens. And so you’re drawn into it gradually, and things expand. </p>

<p id="1WZ21A">Now, the show gets incredibly complex quite quickly. But because you’re grounded that way, in the first season, you’re really with it, and so you’ve earned the right to sort of spread out. A common problem in a lot of big fantasy is you introduce so many characters, so many different locations, so many different storylines simultaneously, it’s hard to get grounded in these realities. And I don’t think <em>Game of Thrones</em> had that problem at all. I think you’re just so with the Starks and Winterfell and their journey out into the world it was very easy to engage, even for people who, you know, aren’t like real, hardcore fantasy people.</p>
<h2 id="iki14k"><strong>How Game of Thrones influenced other shows (including their own)</strong></h2>
<h4 id="op5Oo6"><strong>Matt Shakman</strong></h4>
<p id="DxiQu6">The scope grew over the seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I think it’s easy to forget, but they did whole battles without showing you anything. [In] one episode, Peter Dinklage gets knocked unconscious before the battle starts, so that he wakes up when the battle’s over; they didn’t have the money to do the battle. But you cared about Peter Dinklage, and that’s how you figured out what had happened, from Tyrion’s point of view. And sometimes we do that, when we have to. But if you have characters you believe in and you love, then you’re excited to figure out the information with them.</p>
<h4 id="b34Y59">
<strong>Randall Einhorn (director and producer of</strong><em><strong> Abbott Elementary, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The Office</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="pMRJ7O">The scope and the breadth of that story, taking place all over this <em>huge</em> geography and all these different civilizations, it’s just like, wow. It’s really nice when you find something like that movie; and each one of those is a movie — incredible! It’s really encouraging to think about the size of the stories you can tell, where you can go. It certainly made me look at things that are larger, [and] bigger concept, because they can exist on TV.</p>
<h4 id="Ph3R3E"><strong>Halley Feiffer</strong></h4>
<p id="w6sp8q">It never felt like spectacle for spectacle sake. Everything felt very rooted in character in a way that did make it feel timeless and universal. And that was something that whetted my appetite for that kind of storytelling as a viewer. And as a creator — I suddenly felt like I could, perhaps in my own way, dip my toe into spectacle, and violence and gore. And use that kind of visual storytelling to explore age old and systemic issues like misogyny, like oppression, like gaslighting in ways that I never had considered before.</p>
<h4 id="zkEVIs"><strong>Rafe Judkins</strong></h4>
<p id="YdHAFJ">There’s this character Lady Stoneheart, when Catelyn Stark comes back from the dead. And I was obsessed with this character, couldn’t wait to see her on TV, just live and die, step on my throat Lady Stoneheart. And then when she wasn’t in the show I was like, <em>Bryan!! How could you not do Lady Stoneheart?</em> And he explained it, and it is the correct decision that they made to not do it — because if they’re going to bring back one character from the dead it has to be the one that matters the most to the overall story of the series. And for me there was still like a small death in it, and sadness in it, and anger in it because I — even though I know it’s the right choice for the show — I’m still upset about it. So, watching the show was a very good experience for me, and understanding the fundamentals of how people who love the source material are going to react to it. And the fact that no matter what you do, you can’t actually make everyone happy. So what you have to do the most is treat the story with respect and do everything you can to bring it to the screen in the best way possible that honors what was there.</p>

<p id="gHiuI4">If we’re going to spend a lot of money on these big TV shows, one of the great things we can do is take audiences to new places. I actually thought the way they did King’s Landing on <em>Thrones</em> was really special, because it has — even more so than anyplace else in the show — this very unique use of color, and tone, and hair is different when you’re in King’s Landing than anywhere else. The costumes are different. The color grade of the scenes are different; everything feels sort of like Tuscan and Croatian, and sunkissed. And I think sort of using Dubrovnik as a jumping off point for what they built in the city overall was a really smart way to do it. I really use that as a touchpoint for worldbuilding in <em>Wheel of Time</em>. </p>
<p id="TUT47F">I think one of the reasons <em>Wheel of Time</em> has been able to stick around and succeed where a lot of fantasy shows that follow <em>Game of Thrones</em> haven’t is because we were never chasing <em>Game of Thrones. </em>The Wheel of Time [books] came out before the Game of Thrones books, and it’s a very different kind of show. I’m super thrilled that people were interested in making a fantasy show because of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. But it never had an intention of being the “next <em>Game of Thrones</em>.” I always said, even when pitching it, <em>Game of Thrones</em> was something that appealed to the whole world, and broke across genre lines. And the next show that does that won’t be another big fantasy show, necessarily. It’ll be something else that generates that visceral, emotional reaction in people. And that’s the thing that kind of lets you cross these lines and become more of an international pop cultural phenomenon, than just a television show.</p>
<h4 id="CWK3Fy"><strong>Naren Shankar</strong></h4>
<p id="384h5k">The thing that I definitely remember taking as a very distinct lesson from <em>Game of Thrones</em> was: in the first season, Ned’s execution is episode 9. And in the traditional TV framework, that’s your season finale. And what I really took from that was the importance of letting the audience mourn, and feel for such an incredibly important character. I don’t recall seeing that. It’s like, the ability to process that loss, and let your audience do that, I think was a really big deal. And I can’t remember many shows or any shows really off the top of my head that approached it that way. But I thought that was an incredibly smart choice. </p>

<h4 id="81HMRN"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></h4>
<p id="1dr1kF">I was intrigued by a lot of the maneuvering at King’s Landing and what was happening there and the sort of inside the castle politics of it all, and I liked that. I like the way that it played out, and that you were never sure who’s up and who’s down, that they were always willing to sort of do a reversal of fortune on your favorite character. And I just liked that, as a storyteller. It made me go, <em>Yeah, you know, that’s something to keep your eye on and think about when you’re constructing these kinds of shows. </em>And there were things, to be frank, that I didn’t want to do. I thought sometimes, it was cruel, and I didn’t like the cruelty of it as a storyteller. That’s just a personal preference; that’s not a comment on George, or the world. But there were times that I just, I kind of was put back by it’s just a little too cruel in terms of its treatment of its characters and the treatment of the audience. Sometimes, I love this character. And there seemed to be a circle of delight in making you suffer with him.</p>
<p id="t808yg">It definitely raised the bar in terms of audience expectation of what you could produce on television. And unfortunately, I think the rest of us have suffered since their budget was so big, and they had so many days to shoot these gigantic — I mean, the Battle of the Bastards, I can’t remember how much money they spent on it, and how many days, but it was like a month or something crazy to spend on that one episode. So, and the rest of us mere mortals can’t come close to that kind of money. But the audience doesn’t have those distinctions, right? They just go, <em>Well, I think it should look really great</em>. And so there’s an expectation that whatever you’re doing, should look as good and be as big as what they did on that show. So that’s kind of the downside of what they did to the rest of us. </p>
<h4 id="4UO7q8"><strong>Justin Marks</strong></h4>
<p id="GNOMYn">I think that the scale of a production carries with it a lot of legacy in the culture of our business. I think that, rightly or wrongly — probably both to be honest — when they say “<em>Game of Thrones</em>-esque” what they really mean is “expensive.” And some of that is true, you know, like dragons come by, but not at the beginning. Slowly they build to it in the way that a responsible show ought to. So that held a lot and then created a bit of an arms race, probably; minds who are not as engaged to the creative of our business might see it as a simple thing like that. I think the directors I speak to, the showrunners, the writers I speak to when we talk about how much we love <em>Game of Thrones</em>, we’re really talking about that sprawling scale of the narrative when you’re doing something<em> Game of Thrones-</em>esque.</p>
<h4 id="P3Vuvx"><strong>Karyn Kusama</strong></h4>
<p id="a8xFhU">David and Dan are friends, and I just so appreciate what they accomplished with it. I felt like they were learning as they went, too. And they had some big, huge story reversals that, in a way, predicted now, or created almost an unreasonable pressure to make so much story happen over season to season. (Goddamn them.) So, you know, I really, I think it’s a very, you know, very potent legacy that show. Just even the pressure to have big story events happen, that also managed to still be surprising — that’s an <em>incredibly</em> difficult thing to do. I think TV only gets one or two or three Ned Stark’s, and then you’re kinda like,<em> OK we see it coming</em>. So you really have to find new ways to be surprising. </p>

<h4 id="M4KT8g"><strong>Naren Shankar</strong></h4>
<p id="J1iSCv">I think television business often seems to take the wrong lessons. Because the show got so gigantic and so enormous in terms of its spectacle. For a while [there was] just this internalized lesson, <em>Oh, we’ve got to make everything that costs $25 million an episode </em>— do we? We don’t <em>really</em>, because the years of the show where people just kind of went crazy for it were not those years. You’re forced into these things, and people think that’s the answer. So you had all of these shows that were really ridiculous, big, crazy, high-budget things, because people think that’s the way to get people into the season. And it’s like: it really isn’t. The things that people mostly remember about <em>Game of Thrones </em>are — there’s a lot of two-handers in that show. There’s a lot of scenes where people just talk to each other; they’re incredibly riveting and amazing. </p>
<h4 id="UIhmDD"><strong>Halley Feiffer</strong></h4>
<p id="Nlv3Ok">It’s gone in two directions that I can see. The more obvious direction, as we’ve all kind of famously heard of what is perhaps an apocryphal story of Jeff Bezos rebranding Prime Video and sort of demanding, “Bring me <em>Game of Thrones</em>.” I fell in love with Amazon as a streaming service by watching <em>Transparent </em>and <em>Red Oaks</em> and these small character-driven gritty, grainy, darkly funny, very human stories. Now, of course, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153893/lord-rings-power-season-2-trailer-release-date-sauron">the tentpole show on Prime Video is <em>Lord of the Rings</em></a>. And so I think Bezos was incredibly successful in that regard. And I miss those shows; we have a show like <em>Fleabag</em>, for instance, that wins every single Emmy. And now Phoebe Waller-Bridge is doing Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and I’m sure she’ll do an amazing job with that. And I would love to see more shows like <em>Fleabag</em>, personally, from a mind like that. </p>
<p id="DFrfXF">At the same time, there’s also been this very exciting development of these smaller in scope, more character-driven shows that know they’ll never be the sort of spectacle like <em>Game of Thrones</em> and aren’t trying to be — shows like <em>Severance</em>, like <em>Baby Reindeer</em>, these shows that can have actually a very similar cultural footprint and impact and feel unmissable in terms of the cultural zeitgeist without leaning on extravagant set piece battles. We need both in our culture, but I think sometimes we can forget that we need both.</p>
<p id="aMecTQ">Something I really admire about the creators is they’ve been very open about what they wish they had done differently, and what they are aiming to do differently going forward. So they’ve been very open about the lack of representation in their writers room the first couple of seasons. And we’re still really pushing this ball up the hill in terms of letting more diverse leaders really have their shot at holding the reins of a show. And especially a show like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, which is so rooted in grand spectacle. That’s something I’m excited by, the steps that we’re taking, and also feel we have a long way to go in terms of inclusivity not only for its own sake but in terms of really finding diverse and dynamic storytelling that continues to surprise and satisfy us. </p>
<h4 id="1CP9Iy"><strong>Rafe Judkins</strong></h4>
<p id="cabUOA">I definitely think audiences are receiving this kind of complicated world-building really differently, post-<em>Game of Thrones</em>. Especially now that <em>Wheel</em> has been on for a few seasons, you have more conversations with your dental hygienist or my boyfriend’s mom — people who you wouldn’t expect would be getting into an unbelievably complicated world of high fantasy who are just like, <em>Yeah, I’ll give that a try</em> — <em>and oh, I really like it!</em> And that’s very different than the world before <em>Game of Thrones</em>, where a lot of people would just be like, <em>That’s not the kind of show I watch</em>, or <em>the kind of movie I watch</em>. I think now, people are willing to show up at <em>Dune</em> and give it a try. People are willing to show up to <em>Wheel of Time</em> and give it a try, even if they don’t know the property. Even if they aren’t huge fantasy people, they know that there might be a possibility that they’d like something like this. And I think that’s a real gift <em>Game of Thrones</em> gave to all the rest of the sci fi and fantasy and genre projects out there.</p>
<p id="XeaHa8">I think what’s interesting about <em>Game of Thrones</em> is that it changed what people were chasing in television for a minute; it changed the aspiration of television to something that is more cinematic in a lot of ways. And that doesn’t just affect shows like <em>Wheel of Time, The Witcher</em>, or <em>Shadow and Bone</em> and all the fantasy series that followed <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I think it also affects how we look at all series on TV right now — like, if you open up any show now, it’s much harder to tell from 10 seconds of screen time whether it’s a television show or a movie than it was 10 years ago. And I think a lot of that is due to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because the aspiration to make television shows look cinematic — whether that’s <em>Euphoria</em> or <em>Elite</em>, a Spanish series that’s on Netflix and at a very low budget point — the aspiration is still to make those things all look the same as you would if you were filming them for the cinema. That’s a big change that’s been wrought in television across the last 10 years. And it’s obviously not <em>just</em> from <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It’s also a lot about the availability of cameras, and how to build things that do look more cinematic, and higher budgets for TV shows, and less episodes per season. But: I think a lot of that is due to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and it changed the aspiration of TV shows to be more cinematic than they had been previously — <em>all</em> TV shows.</p>
<h4 id="0VUBfR"><strong>Justin Marks</strong></h4>
<p id="ZpxvwU">It just never felt like it was prepackaged. It’s just this feeling of something that felt like a work of art, you know, despite all of the commercial trappings that obviously you carried with it. And man, that comes along once in a lifetime. The way so much of it has bled into our culture, like great movie moments or things. Everyone knows what I’m talking about when I make that joke, because that’s how much it’s just bled into our culture and changed our culture. And I don’t mean our storytelling culture. I mean, just the culture at large — and that’s a legacy that <em>Seinfeld</em> carries, and <em>Friends, </em>and <em>Cheers</em>, and shows completely outside of genre. Those are the things that <em>Game of Thrones</em> latches onto. It’s not ‘cause of dragons or fantasies or all that. </p>
<h4 id="U7AvMf"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></h4>
<p id="FLDE5O">I think in terms of story, they definitely said, <em>you can do a really intricate plots with multiple characters, and the audience will follow along. </em>If it’s compelling, the audience will hang in there. Then the trick becomes: Can you get them to take that first step? I think that gives comfort to those of us — especially those who work in the genre field. When you’re pitching shows, when you’re developing shows, there’s always a lot of skepticism on the part of executives who are saying, <em>Well, but the audience will be confused, or they won’t follow along, and they don’t understand this world, and you need to explain it more. </em>Well, <em>Game of Thrones</em> didn’t really explain a lot. You just kind of had to go with it, and the audience was definitely willing to go with it. </p>
<p id="5UhZB4">It’s still the one everybody still talks about. People still go into networks, and quickly as a shorthand they’ll say: <em>You know, we’re still looking for our</em> Game of Thrones. It’s still sort of the high watermark of not just fantasy, but how big a show can truly be where it had penetrated pop culture, it was a worldwide success, it was the water cooler show when we still had water coolers to hang around. Just in terms of commercial and critical success — it won the Emmy how many times — everybody still looks to it as: we want something as big as that.</p>
<p id="8QOE26">I was one of the minority that liked the finale. I thought it worked, and I thought it was for the logical extension of our various things that they had set up. It does get that wrap. </p>
<p id="xiEzLb">But I don’t hear a lot of talk about the finale, to be honest. In my conversations — in writer’s rooms, or with executives, or just socially — they talk about how <em>I used to love this, </em>or <em>hated that</em>, or <em>sounds cool</em> or whatever. There’s not too much talk about the actual phenomenon whether people liked it or didn’t like it, at least in my experience. The show <em>is</em> bigger than that. And whenever people thought of the finale, for good or for bad, they talk about the show. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to several credible reports, Valve is developing a new game called Deadlock. Leaked screenshots from the ongoing Closed Alpha playtest have even been shared <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter/X</a> by content creator Gabe Follower.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Deadlock is a third-person hero shooter that draws inspiration from the likes of Overwatch, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/valorant-professionals-wanted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valorant</a>, and others. Valve reporter Tyler McVicker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that it has been in development since 2018 under the codename Citadel.</p>
<p>Matches are a 6v6 affair set on a large map with four lanes. Each lane has a so-called transit line that players can use to move quickly, thanks to a skyhook thing similar to BioShock Infinite's. The setting is completely original and mixes steampunk elements with fantasy.</p>
<p>In one of Gabe Follower's screenshots, we can also read about one of the heroes, Grey Talon. He's described as a hero capable of delivering long-range skill shots with his bow. Here's the in-game description:</p>
<p><em>A cunning predator, Grey Talon uses a combination of deadly accuracy, traps, and clever positioning to bring down the toughest opponents.</em></p>
<p>The screenshot shows him having four abilities, and it's likely this will be true for the other heroes as well. Of course, nobody knows exactly when Valve plans to unveil this game to the world in an official capacity. The same applies to a release date window, although the large playtest without much of an NDA might suggest it won't be long until more people can get their hands on Deadlock.</p>
<p>Until then, stay tuned on Wccftech to be updated on the latest news, leaks, and rumors.</p>

  <p id="vSMHrh"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em> continues Senua’s journey as she heads to the mythical island of Iceland. After the events of <em>Senua’s Sacrifice: Hellblade</em>, Senua is a lot more at peace with her Furies, but the world is still full of monsters both all-to-real and quasi-fantastical.</p>
<p id="xIs4Eb"><em>Hellblade 2 </em>is a deliberately-paced, brutal, extensively mo-capped, narrative-driven adventure that picks up a bit after <em>Senua’s Sacrifce</em>. It’s just as deeply rooted in psychology and psychosis as the first game, but the real star is the way Ninja Theory made use of Unreal Engine 5 to deliver one of this generation’s first real next-gen moments. “There’s nothing else quite like it,” is how we put it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5">in our preview</a> back in April.</p>
<p id="ZDYePk"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 </em>comes out on Xbox Series X and Windows PC on May 21. Here’s <strong>what time </strong><em><strong>Hellblade 2 </strong></em><strong>releases</strong> in your time zone.</p>

  <p id="pC3IeD"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is having a Bounsweet Community Day event on<strong> Sunday, May 19, from 2-5 p.m. in your local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="dnBcPc">As expected with a Community Day event,<strong> Bounsweet </strong>will spawn in huge numbers with a high chance for it to appear shiny. There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve list out below.</p>
<hr id="sH67yG">
<h2 id="JHxyzU"><strong>How do I catch a shiny Bounsweet?</strong></h2>
<p id="ZGv7YR">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon.</p>

<p id="JqBuiK">If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an <strong>Incense</strong>, then quickly <strong>tap each Bounsweet </strong>to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Bounsweet you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help you identify which ones you may have already checked.</p>
<hr id="fCZXnK">
<h2 id="Rck3HW"><strong>What Community Day move does Bounsweet’s evolution learn?</strong></h2>
<p id="P33K1t">If you evolve Steenee into Tsareena between 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move <strong>High Jump Kick</strong>.</p>
<p id="pcrxXf">If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get High Jump Kick. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines">Elite TM</a> to get the move.</p>
<hr id="sJ5mE8">
<h2 id="PRBqBQ"><strong>How does Tsareena do in the meta?</strong></h2>
<p id="UnfEw0">In terms of PvE (raids and gyms), Tsareena is behind the usual powerful attackers like Kartana and most shadow and Mega starters (Mega Sceptile, Mega Venusaur, Shadow Venusaur, Shadow Torterra — you get the gist). However, it sits among Roserade and Chesnaught in terms of power. So if you usually use these two and don’t have the resources to invest into Megas, Legendaries, and Shadows, then Tsareena is worth having with <strong>Magical Leaf </strong>and <strong>Grass Knot</strong>.</p>
<p id="Ome1FM">While High Jump Kick will give Tsareena some range in PvP, it’s still likely not worth using outside of specialized cups and tournaments.</p>
<hr id="wsHYws">
<h2 id="rVGJO4"><strong>How do I make the most of Bounsweet Community Day?</strong></h2>
<p id="VP2Yku">The following bonuses will be active during Bounsweet Community Day:</p>
<ul>
<li id="IH0sir">
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> hatch distance for eggs placed into Incubators during the event</li>
<li id="ygtKvn">Doubled candy for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="IlHTnG">Doubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="PF2Fbg">Incense lasts three hours</li>
<li id="R4eQq7">Lure Modules lasts three hours</li>
<li id="Kt1oY9">Bounsweet special photobombs when taking snapshots</li>
<li id="3l86uP">One additional special trade</li>
<li id="QaoYEy">Stardust cost halved for trading</li>
</ul>
<p id="kOd6mO">That said, you should definitely put your eggs in Incubators and pop an Incense and try to nab some powerful Bounsweet.</p>
<p id="tLRqH5">If you can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids"><strong>Mega Evolve</strong></a> <strong>Venusaur, Sceptile, Groudon, or Abomasnow</strong>, you’ll score additional Bounsweet Candy per catch.</p>
<p id="mfZjRH">In addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Steenee raid, Bounsweet will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Bounsweet you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.</p>

            <p>Seablip is a pixel art pirate 'em up, which promises an open world to sail around, islands to visit, crews to hire, bounties to hunt, and minigames through which to uncover treasure and fish. It looks adorable and it's out in Early Access now.

<p>The bit that always interests me most in games like these is the crew management, because I like looking after little guys. The sailors in Seablip sound as if they have a fair amount going on: there's a finite number of them so you've an incentive to keep them alive and happy, and they each have skills and attributes that'll change as they go through fights.
</p>
<p>There seems to be quite a few pirate 'em ups that split the game into distinct activities, which I'm assuming is thanks to Sid Meier's influence, and you can guess the way they link together. Winning fights and chasing down bounties provides resources for hiring crew and upgrading your ship which in turn helps you win fights and you get the idea.
</p>
<p>Watching the trailer for Seablip above gave me a full, Ratatouille-like zoom to a memory of playing Puzzle Pirates nearly twenty years ago. Puzzle Pirates is <a href="https://www.puzzlepirates.com/">still going</a>, I discovered! It's a pirate MMO where every activity is a different puzzle game and it was colourful and cosy in a way Seablip seems reminiscent of, in vibe if not substance.
</p>
<p>You'll find Seablip <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471270/Seablip/">on Steam</a> where it's £11.51/€13.31/$13.49. It's aiming for a full release next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-microtransactions-ubisoft-confirms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent blog post, Ubisoft outlined the monetisation plans for XDefiant, the soon-to-launch first-person shooter that’s totally free to play. As you might expect, there will be plenty of optional purchases in XDefiant, but Ubisoft has pledged that there will be no ‘pay-to-win’ mechanics. The full breakdown provided below details how your money can be spent in XDefiant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-amazing-customisation-options">‘Amazing Customisation Options’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/1Xg1YrL6SEcqcuTDNIYSGz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft has stressed</a> a critical point by stating boldly that there will be no pay-to-win elements in XDefiant. It was confirmed that any ‘gameplay-impacted content’ can be both purchased and earned in-game, which means that users can either get their hands on something immediately or grind the game and unlock it over time.</p>



<p>XDefiant will reward players for investing their time and effort into the game, it was revealed. That means that even going on a losing streak will reward you with experience points and content. Here are the kinds of rewards you’ll unlock for progressing through the game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Battle Pass Rewards</li>



<li>In-Game Challenges</li>



<li>Ubisoft Connect Challenges</li>



<li>Weapon Mastery</li>



<li>Participation Rewards</li>
</ul>



<p>Ubisoft then confirmed that customisation is at the heart of the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to be providing amazing customisation options that reward all of the matches, victories, and even defeats that you put into the game. We know being able to display your identity as a player is important, and so customization will be key to the XDefiant experience.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, players will be able to both unlock and purchase:</p>



<ul>
<li>Character Skins</li>



<li>Weapon Skins</li>



<li>MVP Player Animations</li>



<li>Player Cards</li>



<li>Emoji Packs</li>
</ul>



<p>Players will also be prompted to purchase a premium battle pass when they start playing XDefiant – but there will also be a free pathway that’ll reward players with <strong>less prestigious </strong>unlocks. </p>



<p>Are you going to invest any extra money in XDefiant?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-wont-be-long-now-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-won%E2%80%99t-be-long-now-before-launch.874920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-wont-be-long-now-before-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Fallout London Project Manager Dean Carter also said the community would want support for Fallout 4 pre- and post-next-generation update, and the team is considering whether that is feasible.</p>
<p><em>We are being tempted by community feedback to launch on the old version alongside the new version. But this isn't set in stone as it would effectively double our release workload.</em></p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> The Fallout London total conversion mod for Fallout 4 was supposed to launch on St. George's Day, April 23rd, but Bethesda's next-generation update <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-mod-is-officially-delayed-due-to-bethesdas-upcoming-fallout-4-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupted those plans</a>.</p>
<p>We last heard from the team over a month ago when they announced the inevitable delay without being able to nail down another date. This morning, Project Manager Dean Carter (known online as Prilladog) posted an update on the Fallout London Discord channel. To be clear, the message isn't mainly about the release date; it is instead an endorsement of GOG, which helped the Fallout London team a lot with the mod's distribution. The update also links to a new interview <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-london-gog-release-delay-fallout-4-update-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on The Gamer</a> featuring both GOG and Dean Carter himself. The Project Manager said:</p>
<p><em>We initiated discussions with GOG to release Fallout London after Nexus faced challenges hosting the files. Without the combined help of Nexus Mods and GOG, releasing Fallout: London wouldn't be possible.</em></p>
<p>However, right after linking to the article, Prilladog also wrote, 'We hope not long now—fingers crossed.' While not exactly a confirmation, it does hint at a forthcoming resolution of the compatibility issues with the new version of Fallout 4.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Fallout London is a fan-made game-sized mod that imagines how the UK's capital would fare following the nuclear apocalypse (something that Bethesda doesn't intend to do in the foreseeable future, as Todd Howard recently confirmed the studio will stick to US settings). It is set in 2237, between the first and second installments and around fifty years before Fallout 4.</p>
<p>According to Team FOLON, the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) wouldn't have made it to the UK, so don't expect to encounter Deathclaws, Super Mutants, and the like. Similarly, there is no Vault-Tec in the UK, though there will be underground shelters. The factions are also entirely new, so players won't find the Enclave, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Institute, et cetera.</p>
<p>In terms of size, Fallout London is massive. Its playable space will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-total-conversion-mod-to-launch-in-april-2024-has-a-playable-space-as-large-as-base-game-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the size of the base Fallout 4 game plus the Far Harbor DLC</a>. Fans can also look forward to 53 main quests, 35 side quests, 25 faction quests, 64 miscellaneous quests, 16 branching gang quests, 7 companions (5 of which are fully voiced with detailed relationship levels and their own companion quests), over 90K recorded voice lines (1.5x the number of lines in Fallout New Vegas or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and only slightly less than Fallout 4, with the difference that Bethesda's game had a voiced protagonist and Fallout London does not), a revamped crafting system for ammo, an overhauled perk and dialogue system with skill and perk checks during dialogues, new player animations such as ladder climbing and swimming, fast travel options such as trains, taxis, and boats, dynamic weather, new smoking mechanics, and playable guitars. To play the mod, you must own Fallout 4 and all of its DLCs.</p>
<p>In other Fallout news, the franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is about to land in Fortnite</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-card-sizes-and-dimensions-explained-for-competitive-play/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mtg-card-sizes-and-dimensions-explained-for-competitive-play<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While it might seem unimportant at first, the card sizes and dimensions for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> cards are actually critical to competitive play and fairness within the community. They not only help to avoid cheating, but they also prevent you from getting scammed. </p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true"><em>MTG</em> cards are designed to be a specific size and weight to help protect fans who buy and sell them but also ensure the competitive scene stays free of any cheating. Markedly different cards can have a serious impact on a game, making it difficult to tell what the card does or if the text has even been altered to give a player an advantage through a completely fake rule. If you’re buying, selling, or playing with <em>MTG</em> cards, it’s worth checking if they’re the right size and shape to avoid a humiliating loss. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-are-the-official-mtg-card-sizes-and-dimensions-for-competitive-play" data-injectable="false">What are the official <em>MTG</em> card sizes and dimensions for competitive play?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Scryfall</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">According to Wizards of the Coast, the official <em>MTG</em> card sizes and dimensions for competitive play are<strong> 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm)</strong>. While foil cards are slightly thicker, most cards are <strong>0.012 inches (0.305 mm) in thickness</strong> and weigh between <strong>1.7 and 1.8 grams</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">However, there are a few exceptions to these sizes and dimensions. For example, printing errors can create cards that are slightly larger and heavier. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1997 <em>MTG</em> <em>Vanguard</em></a> set’s Vanguard cards are all 3 inches (7.6 cm) by 5 inches (12.7 cm), meaning they’re all larger but are technically tournament-legal. These get set aside at the start of a game, so they’re more of a gimmick and don’t impact the rest of the game that much. </p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">When it comes to these exceptions, they generally need to be revealed to both the judges and the opponent before a game even starts. If both players agree that a card isn’t fake and can be used for a specific purpose, then, most of the time, it can be. </p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">Obviously, this isn’t always the case, but when it comes to proxies and cards of that type, the general rule of thumb is that as long as you’re upfront about them with your opponent and agree to work with them in your game, they’re fine. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Why do <em>MTG</em> cards have to be a specific size and weight?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">The reason <em>MTG</em> cards must conform to specific dimensions, size, and weight is because it’s considered marking if they don’t. Card marking is illegal in competitive play because it gives you an unfair advantage over your opponent. </p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">You could compare this to drawing a black line on the back of a powerful card or one you know you need for your planned strategy. If you’ve got a hand that allows you to get your card, if you know that it’s potentially only five cards deep in your deck, that’s unfair on your opponent who doesn’t know where their cards are in their deck. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Furthermore, a weighted card, or one that’s slightly bigger than the rest, could make it easier to pick out in cases where your opponent gives you a set of face-down cards to pick from. There are several strategies where bigger cards can be of help in a game, which is why all cards must stick to the outlined sizing. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Another advantage of this strict rule on card sizes is that it makes it harder for anyone to create fake cards and sell them for a profit. This could become a real problem, especially with cards like the One of One Ring from the <em>Tales of Middle-Earth</em> set. If cards didn’t have a set weight, even for foil versions, then it would be far too easy to fake rare cards for a profit. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/18/24159721/retrohai-nintendo-ds-lite-game-boy-color-advance-sp-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever looked at a Nintendo DS and thought it would be cooler if the top screen was swapped for the Game Boy Advance SP’s? Or looked at a Super Nintendo controller and wished it had a GBA SP screen bolted onto the back? Whether you have or not, Hardware modder Hairo Satoh, aka Retrohai hai Softbank, has you covered with some truly cursed reimaginings of Nintendo’s portable consoles. (Recall their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125681/now-thats-a-playstation-portable">portable emulated PlayStation</a> built into the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoURW25xReoI">Takara Roulette Controller</a>.) </p><p>Let’s go on a little journey through Satoh’s Instagram account. Before we get into my favorite mutated Nintendo handhelds — frankententos, if you will — know that Satoh also does some very pretty custom jobs on the company’s various portable consoles. And they’re <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17892712832143201/">made to order</a>.</p><p>This one they posted recently is a good example. We are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">Known Transparent Case Stans</a> here at <em>The Verge</em>, but this goes a step further with its colorful hologram stickers and ChromaFlair-style color-changing sheen. Oh, and it runs Game Boy Advance games.</p><p>That controller mod I mentioned up top isn’t the only time Satoh has turned a console gamepad into its own handheld. The GBA SP’s screen looks remarkably at home on an SNES (well, Super Famicom, technically) pad...</p><p>...and on a PS2 Dual Shock controller, too.</p><p>But why not jam one onto a Nintendo DS Lite, too? It doesn’t make sense at all, even if this is a mash-up of the two most attractive pieces of hardware Nintendo ever made, but I don’t need any justification for this thing’s existence. Also, this is the point where things start getting a little cursed.</p><p>I guess this is also a Nintendo DS?</p><p>Again, but more colorful. </p><p>Ah yes, the Original Game Boy Advance SP DS (OGBASPDS). </p><p>I’m enamored with the concept of a multi-position adjustable screen on this original DS.</p><div><p>What if... GBA SP but also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115039/danger-hiptop-t-mobile-sidekick-jump-button">T-Mobile Sidekick</a>?</p></div><p>Give me this and the ability to emulate the fantastic vertical-scrolling shooter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/21/17489520/nintendo-switch-flip-grip-accessory-vertical-arcade-games"><em>Ikaruga</em></a><em>, </em>please<em>.</em></p><p>I’m sorry, what?</p><p>Ah, yes, this makes sense.</p><p>I can’t say I understand the extra buttons and d-pad here, but I respect the chaos.</p><p>The Nintendo Long Boy DS.</p><p>I think this is probably the final boss of Satoh’s inventive creations. </p><p>Satoh didn’t respond to us when we reached out, but we’d love to know more about these creations. How much of these are made up of custom hardware on the inside? How many of them are emulating Nintendo’s handhelds, rather than rejiggering its original hardware components to fit? If we receive a response, we’ll dig in some more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> pre-orders are "looking very strong".</p>
<p>That's according to notable – and often accurate – leaker Tom Henderson, who claims that "no one in the know [at Ubisoft] is disappointed" with the number of pre-orders the highly-anticipated action-RPG has secured so far.</p>

<p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows pre-orders are looking very strong," Henderson said in his full, if brief, statement on Twitter/X. "I don't have the exact numbers yet, but no one in the know is disappointed with them."</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>The pre-orders are likely clocking up after our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-dual-protagonists">first proper look at Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> earlier this week, which detailed the game's dual protagonists. Both characters appear front and centre in the game's new cinematic trailer and on the game's cover, with each offering a markedly different play style. A gameplay trailer will follow next month, Ubisoft says.</p>
<p>As Tom described for us at the time, the teaser embedded above opens on Naoe, a female shinobi, as she crosses paths with Yasuke, the historical figure depicted here as a powerful samurai. Initially, it seems, the two are adversaries - but the pair soon find common ground. By the end of the trailer, Naoe is wearing the Assassin's Creed series' iconic Hidden Blade weapon - and both appear to be at least allied with the Assassins.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boxed-copies-still-require-internet-connection-to-first-play">Assassin's Creed Shadows players will need to connect to the internet to first install the game</a>, although there is no "mandatory connection" requirement.</p>
<p>"We wanted to share some early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," Ubisoft wrote.</p>
<p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection."</p>

<p>"A variety of collaborative in-game events designed in the spirit of 'One Empire', and how each citizen’s individual contributions help create humanity's unrivaled power of unity that has taken it beyond the stars, showcase the might of the UEE Navy and invites citizens to explore the vessels that keep the ‘verse safe," Cloud Imperium Games teases.</p>
<p>"The improved New Player Experience, originally released for Area18 in Alpha 3.19, has been expanded and is now supported on all starting locations. While the same core skills are taught at each location, new players can now choose to begin high in the cloud city of Orison, in the mining town of Lorville owned and operated by Hurston Dynamics, on New Babbage, which is both a bustling major trading hub and home to high-end electronic companies, or back at Area18’s urban downtown where bright lights attract commerce and entertainment."</p>
<p>Existing players who convince a pal to jump on-board can also secure a 5000 aUEC bonus if their friend uses their referral code.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium Games' CEO, Chris Roberts, recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">Star Citizen was pushing towards the "finish line" of a 1.0 release</a>.</p>
<p>"After many hard years of work towards a goal many thought was impossible, we are on the cusp of delivering one of the final pieces of technology that will enable a connected, shared universe that thousands of people can experience together at the same time," Roberts explained in his <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">latest Letter from the Chairman update</a> in March.</p>

  <p id="NVaWDO">While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23920816"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>’s alternate history means the show is already much more racially diverse than other Regency-era romances, the show so far has still been very heteronormative and deeply patriarchal, even with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23709730/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-review">Queen Charlotte</a> ruling. If women can’t even inherit property without a man or an heir, they definitely can’t kiss other women (and same goes for dudes). </p>
<p id="tvqmrM">But new showrunner Jess Brownell told <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/05/11718497/bridgerton-queer-storylines-future-showrunner-interview">Refinery29 Australia</a> that queer main characters will be featured in the show’s future seasons. </p>
<p id="qRtw0k">“I think this is a show about the many ways in which people love,” said Brownell. “So it only feels right to show all the ways in which people love, including queer love. So we are exploring queer love stories across the next couple of seasons,” she added.</p>
<p id="DxWgt0">Now, Brownell was tight-lipped about just <em>which</em> characters would have queer romances. But there are some strong contenders — especially when it comes to the Bridgerton family. </p>

<p id="kgkZXE">All of the older brothers have had their share of sex and debauchery (thanks 1800s-era double standards!), but Benedict is still the only one who has seen a dude get it on with another dude. In the first season, he went to a wild party hosted by artist Henry Granville, and eventually learned about Granville’s clandestine relationship with another man. </p>
<p id="w3aJl9">And Benedict (Luke Thompson) is the most artsy-fartsy of the Bridgerton siblings. Being avant-garde and in touch with one’s artistic side is a stereotype that filmmakers and TV writers alike have used to indicate that a <a href="https://www.them.us/story/high-school-musical-ryan-gay">male character is queer for decades</a>. </p>
<p id="IMRAs0">While all of the brothers aren’t super keen on finding a match, he’s the one who’s arguably put the least effort in, and shown the least interest in, actually courting a woman. Before <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown">Anthony met Kate</a>, he was smitten with his opera singer mistress. And Colin even proposed to Marina Thompson back in season 1. But Benedict’s only really been interested in the sexual part of relationships. It could be that he’s missing a certain spark. </p>
<p id="B8SirI">This season, he strikes up yet another sexual relationship with a new female character. This time, though, Lady Tilley Arnold (Hannah New) is a widow, and described by <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/10/bridgerton-season-three-hannah-new-black-sails-starz-netflix-shonda-rhimes-1235143731/">Deadline</a> as a ”living life on her own terms with financial independence and sexual freedom.” In the first half of season 3, we certainly see her hold her own with the men of the Ton — but could that sexual freedom mean opening Benedict’s mind beyond heterosexuality? </p>

<p id="MNrFne">Eloise (Claudia Jessie) has rejected societal conventions from the very first season. She doesn’t want to get married at all and would rather wax on about the rights of women. She and Penelope once bonded over this, back when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995119/bridgerton-lady-whistledown-spoiler">Eloise was inspired by Lady Whistledown</a>. Of course, that got a wrench thrown into it, but Eloise constantly seeks female friendship in a way that we don’t really see with the other female characters her age, who are more preoccupied with finding a proper suitor. </p>
<p id="Vcywpq">Female characters who speak out against marriage and traditional social norms often end up coded as queer when it comes to most movies and TV shows, particularly ones with historical settings. Even if they’re not textually presented as queer, many <a href="https://www.them.us/story/little-women-greta-gerwig-jo-march-queer">fans spark to these characters and claim them</a>. </p>
<p id="Y7xC8J">Even though she had a bit of a flirtation with a charming newspaper boy in season 2, Eloise’s closest relationships outside her family are with other women. This season, we see her grow closer with Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), which brings a nice depth to Cressida’s Mean Girl antics. Both Eloise and Cressida confide in each other about wanting to live their own lives without being married. And we see them seeking out each other’s company at events, in a way that almost plays out like a traditional courtship. </p>
<p id="UpewzB">When asked about possible queer-coding in Eloise and Cressida’s relationship, <a href="https://decider.com/2024/05/17/bridgerton-season-3-jessica-madsen-cressida-cowper-interview/">Madsen told Decider</a> that she’d be stoked if that was the case.</p>
<p id="Ne6VDh">“I absolutely love that,” she said. “That would be the best! Yeah, I mean, that would be cool. I like to think it would make sense because, like, she hasn’t bagged a guy. So, like, why not a gal?”</p>
<p id="6B7KyA">Eloise and Benedict share a particularly special relationship too, one that makes them very much at odds with their more marriage-focused family. They’re often seen together, making jests at the expense of the ladies and gentlemen of the Ton. They’re both the second-eldest son/daughter, both have a passion for something other than being a rich person. While some of the other Bridgerton siblings weren’t too keen on the idea of marriage in the first place (like  Anthony and Francesca), Eloise and Benedict more openly reject the institution of marriage. </p>

<p id="y2ybms">Now there <em>is</em> an existing fully-fleshed out and beautifully poignant queer love story in the Bridgerton universe — but you’d have to watch the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23715775/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-spinoff-brimsley-reynolds"><em>Queen Charlotte</em> miniseries</a> to experience it. As it turns out, the Queen’s butler Brimsley is in a long relationship with the King’s butler Reynolds. We saw the full extent of that relationship in the prequel, but we haven’t seen Reynolds in the modern day. He <em>could</em> be dead, but also we just haven’t seen a lot of King George at all, so maybe Reynolds is simply attending to his boss and we’ll see the gay butlers reunited!</p>

<p id="s9bv1T">There is, of course, the strong chance that the queer <em>Bridgerton</em> love story does not belong to one of the main siblings. After all, this is a show with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22991651/bridgerton-season-1-recap-season-2">a <em>lot</em> of characters and side plots</a>. Maybe it’s a heavily featured side character (sapphic arc for Lady Danbury, perhaps?), or maybe it is someone introduced solely in an upcoming season to have a background romance. </p>
<p id="HQOb5Y">Hopefully this promised queer love story is given just as much weight as the heterosexual ones. After all, this is an alternate history, where love conquers all and the showrunners aren’t exactly beholden to historical accuracy. </p>
<p id="mVKx76">As Brownell says: “We have the privilege of living in this fantasy world which means we can push back against some of the reality of what happened in the 1800s.”</p>

<p data-characters="335" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are few games that are still going as strong, even after over ten years, like <em>Minecraft</em>. But, even today, there are plenty of ways to play the game by checking out different seeds. This way, you’ll still have plenty of adventures and tons of fun. However, you might need to do a little searching for the best possible seed.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Seeds in <em>Minecraft</em>, instead of having a randomly generated world, are worlds already set up with plenty to find in them. After so many years of the beloved survival game being around, there’s a chance of it getting stale, but these seeds will let you enjoy everything that 2024 has to offer for the beloved title.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-1-sakura-season-seed-5584399987456711267" data-injectable="false">1. Sakura Season (<strong>Seed: -5584399987456711267</strong>)</h2> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Cherry blossoms are just as magical in <em>Minecraft</em> as they are in real life. This seed lets you enjoy the beautiful pink trees in a huge Cherry Blossom biome, which was introduced in the 1.20 update. Randomly generated maps aren’t always going to feature tons of stunning trees, but this seed lets you enjoy tons of them everywhere you look. It’s easily one of the prettiest seeds you’ll find.</p>
 <h2 id="h-2-shipwreck-survival-seed-8065848147699287859" data-injectable="false">2. Shipwreck Survival (Seed: -8065848147699287859)</h2> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">Coming across a shipwreck while out sailing is a great find, since there can be a hoard of treasures within. However, it’s much harder when you spawn on the shipwreck itself. This seed starts you out on one of the shipwrecks, surrounded by nothing but ocean as far as you can see. You’ll need to scavenge materials from the shipwreck, build a boat, and begin your voyage to find any land you can.</p>
 <h2 id="h-3-giant-cavern-seed-7445395903252703439" data-injectable="false">3. Giant Cavern (Seed: 7445395903252703439)</h2> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Similar to the previous seed, this one instead spawns you inside of a massive cavern underground, with the goal of working your way up and out. Of course, being deep in the earth, there are plenty of resources for you to take to make it easier to build your way up to the surface. There are tons of smaller winding caves to explore in the cavern, and other great finds with this cool seed.</p> <figure data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-coastal-village-seed-7783854906403730143" data-injectable="false">4. Coastal Village (Seed: -7783854906403730143)</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">This seed will spawn you right next to a charming village right on the water. While there are great places for adventuring nearby, such as the mountains and ocean ruins, there are also plenty of great views in the village on the shore. It’s a perfect balance of cozy gaming to make a great farm and house, and adventuring to find the best gear and resources like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-minecraft-iron-level-explained/">iron</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-mooshroom-biome-seed-859337968100847433" data-injectable="false">5. Mooshroom Biome (Seed: 859337968100847433)</h2> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">What’s more enticing than mushroom cows? Since they were introduced into <em>Minecraft </em>years ago, Mooshrooms have been one of the most beloved mobs in the game. This seed gives you plenty of them to enjoy the company of, with a massive mushroom biome to explore when you travel to the island located at the coordinates 128, 66. Plus, the entire island is safe from monsters, making it a perfect paradise to use as a base.</p>
 <h2 id="h-6-ancient-city-and-trail-ruins-seed-4349791831285849707" data-injectable="false">6. Ancient City and Trail Ruins (Seed: 4349791831285849707)</h2> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">If you’re on the hunt for a great place to find armor trims, this is the seed you need to get. Not only is it chock full of fantastic places to explore, including the trail ruins above and the ancient city below, but it’s also easy to find the extremely rare ward <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-armor-enchantments-in-minecraft/">armor</a> trims to deck yourself out in while you’re out and about. This seed is perfect for adventures and exploring.</p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-7-woodland-mansion-seed-5705783928676095273" data-injectable="false">7. Woodland Mansion (Seed: 5705783928676095273)</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Spawning directly in front of a massive mansion in the woods is a great head start to any <em>Minecraft</em> game. This seed gives you just that, along with a sprawling ancient city just nearby down below to go exploring in. Both the mansion and ancient city have plenty of armor trims for players to find, giving you tons to do no matter what kind of loot you’re interested in.</p> <h2 id="h-8-frozen-lake-of-cherries-seed-6384763642895912697" data-injectable="false">8. Frozen Lake of Cherries (Seed: -6384763642895912697)</h2> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">I can’t help putting another Cherry Blossom seed on this list because they’re just so lovely. This seed is a beautiful combination of the pink sakura trees and plenty of ice spikes and snow, making a gorgeous winter combo. It’s the perfect scenic place to build a home or even an entire village. It’s definitely more for aesthetics than anything, but it’s still full of adventure.</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-badlands-mountain-seed-932245979383499761" data-injectable="false">9. Badlands Mountain (Seed: <strong>-932245979383499761</strong>)</h2> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Far from the lush lands that have appeared so far on this list, this seed will spawn you right on top of a mountain of badlands, surrounded by nothing but desert. It’ll be tough to scavenge your way through this land due to the lack of trees and other necessary resources. If you’re up for a challenge, this is a great seed to do it with.</p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-bamboo-jungle-and-buried-treasure-seed-4813269715648826820" data-injectable="false">10. Bamboo Jungle and Buried Treasure (Seed: -4813269715648826820)</h2> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="false">With this seed, you’ll be instantly surrounded by beautiful jungle and bamboo as far as the eye can see. This is stunning enough as it is, giving you plenty of materials to work with, but with this seed, you’ll also want to dig around to find tons of buried treasure along the shore. While you’re busy <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-tame-a-parrot-in-minecraft/">taming parrots</a> and harvesting jungle wood, you’ll also get to uncover plenty of secrets. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Regarding Call of Duty, it’s easy to argue that <em>Black Ops</em> is perhaps the most beloved and popular series in the franchise’s history. With <em>Black Ops 6</em> firmly on the horizon, I’ve looked through the last 16 years to rank every Treyarch-developed game from worst to best. </p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">It’s a testament to the quality of the <em>Black Ops </em>series that Treyarch is widely viewed as the best <em>Call of Duty</em> developer, which made ranking the six mainline entries difficult. A dev team rarely has no absolute stinkers in their library, but Treyarch has never made a bad <em>CoD</em> game, at least in my opinion. </p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">However, this is an article to rank them all, so I couldn’t sit on the fence and say that they’re all great, which is why we’ve ranked them all in order. For this list, we’ve included <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em>, as it is viewed as the beginning of the <em>Black Ops </em>series due to characters from it appearing in 2010’s <em>Black Ops</em>. </p>
 <hr data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-6-black-ops-4" data-injectable="false">6. <em>Black Ops 4</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>It has its moments. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2018</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Multiplayer, Zombies, Blackout</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Picking the worst <em>Black Ops</em> game is like going to a donut shop and picking the least tasty one: They’re all pretty good. There had to be a loser though, and for me, <em>Black Ops 4</em> is probably the least memorable title in the series, and always felt like I wasn’t sure what kind of <em>Call of Duty</em> game it was. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The return to “boots on the ground” <em>CoD</em> was certainly welcome, but bringing Specialist abilities back meant that <em>BO4</em> felt like an odd mix of classic<em> </em>and futuristic <em>Call of Duty</em> that never quite worked for me. The decision not to release with a campaign also damaged this title, and the public reception to it meant Black Ops 4 was on the back foot before it was even released. </p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">Treyarch does deserve credit for the game though, for the most part, the multiplayer was fun and Blackout was a great introduction to Battle Royale in CoD, laying the groundwork for the ultra-successful Warzone. While Blackout was a little clunky and wasn’t updated very often, it was still an enjoyable experience, one that shaped the <em>Call of Duty</em> we play today. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. <em>World at War</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>The first entry into the franchise. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2008</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false"><em>World at War</em> is viewed as the starting part of the <em>Black Ops</em> franchise, even though it doesn’t feature the series’ iconic title. Set during World War II, it was a stark change from the previous year’s game, <em>Call of Duty 4</em>: <em>Modern Warfare</em>. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">As it’s the oldest <em>CoD</em> game on this list, it’s easy to write it off, but to do so would be a mistake. The campaign is one of my personal favorites—It’s dark and gritty, and switching between the Americans and the Soviets really gives you a feeling that you’re not in control of what’s happening, and the true intensity of war. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">Of course, you can’t talk about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-call-of-duty-world-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WAW</a></em> without gushing about Zombies, the starting point of the legendary mode, and some of my favorite memories in <em>Call of Duty</em>. I can still picture myself sitting in my old bedroom playing Nacht der Untoten with my buddies, even though I was terrible at it. </p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, multiplayer is where I feel like <em>World at War</em> slips down this list, as I didn’t enjoy many of the maps, the weapon meta was dominated by the PPSh-41, and the inclusion of tanks didn’t feel like <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer to me. In truth, I ended up returning to <em>CoD4</em> before the year ended, and I never looked back. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. <em>Black Ops 3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Just too much going on in multiplayer for me. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2015</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, macOS, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies, Bonus (Dead Ops Arcade, Nightmares, Freerun)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">Look, before I get into <em>Black Ops 3</em>, I have to be honest. <em>Advanced Warfare</em> is, in my opinion, the best jetpack <em>Call of Duty</em> game by a mile, and I don’t care what anyone says. So with that in mind, there was simply no way I could rank it any higher than this, even though I know <em>BO3</em> has its loyalists who think it’s the best <em>CoD</em> ever. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="735" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 3</a></em> multiplayer is fun, but I think the jetpacks are almost too powerful. Being able to wall-run and dash to the sides made it play too quick for my liking, and at times it felt like you were playing <em>Halo</em> rather than <em>CoD</em>. It does have some really good maps like Stronghold or Evac, but it’s also got some stinkers like Exodus and Havoc which were just not enjoyable to play. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">For me, <em>BO3</em> also has the weakest campaign in the series and ended up being a confusing experience that didn’t really explain why you were doing anything. The campaign gameplay is fun and does have some good moments, but it’s not enough to make up for the flawed story. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. <em>Black Ops Cold War</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>My favorite of the recent <em>CoD</em> releases. Image via Treyarch. </figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2020</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><em>Black Ops Cold War</em> is my favorite of the “modern” <em>Call of Duty</em> titles and was lightyears better than 2019’s <em>Modern Warfare</em> reboot. There’s a lot to like about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BOCW</a></em>, with a solid campaign that’s bolstered by the fact that decisions you make during the story can change the ending you see. I ended up completing it a couple of times to see what happened, which is something I rarely do with <em>CoD</em> campaigns. </p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">The Zombies Dark Aether storyline was also really strong, and the gameplay was, in my opinion, the best since <em>Black Ops 2</em>. The maps were good, the gameplay didn’t get too convoluted, and it was generally an enjoyable experience. Multiplayer on this game was also great, with gunplay feeling much more rewarding than <em>MW</em> and classic maps returning to the game. I spent hours playing <em>BOCW</em>‘s Ranked Mode, and if it was still live, I’d be tempted to go back. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">My only real gripe with <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> is how strong the skill-based matchmaking felt in multiplayer, which made playing matches feel more like work than fun at times. Still, I have fond memories of this game, and it almost feels harsh to rank it third. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <em>Black Ops</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>The jump from <em>World at War</em> to <em>Black Ops</em> is huge. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2010</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, macOS, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo DS</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">The first <em>CoD</em> game to boast the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops</a></em> title, Treyarch’s 2010 is an almost flawless <em>Call of Duty</em> game. The campaign was the best in the entire franchise at the time, with an ending (which we won’t spoil in case you haven’t played it) that will blow your mind. </p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Multiplayer gameplay was also excellent, with weapons that were enjoyable and rewarding to use, while the maps were also widely excellent. <em>Black Ops</em> is the game that introduced Nuketown, one of <em>CoD</em>‘s most iconic maps that is recreated to this day, showing how influential this game really was. </p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">No surprise, but <em>Black Ops’ </em>Zombies mode is also brilliant, with unique maps that each posed different challenges, a solid storyline that weaved through every map, and great gameplay that added new guns like the Thunder and Wave Guns.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">1. <em>Black Ops 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>The undisputed King of <em>CoD</em>. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2012</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii U</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="147" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> is the pinnacle of the franchise. It’s not just the best <em>Black Ops </em>game, it’s the best <em>Call of Duty</em>, period. </p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BO2</a></em> was the first campaign in the series to use branching storylines, with decisions you make affecting the ending you get. Better than that, the choices have real stakes and really invest you in the story. Treyarch went above and beyond in this campaign and hasn’t been able to match it since. </p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Zombies in <em>Black Ops 2</em> is good, not great, but still, a really fun experience that is boosted by its incredible gunplay and all-around gameplay. Mob, Origins, and Die Rise are all solid maps that each have their unique style too, helping to keep the mode fresh. </p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><em>Black Ops 2</em> multiplayer, however, is where this game blows everything else out of the water. This game has arguably the best maps in the franchise, with remakes still popping up in <em>CoD </em>games to this day. On top of that, the guns feel so rewarding to use, the Pick 10 class system is still yearned for by players, and League Play is the standard to which all <em>CoD</em> Ranked Play modes are still held, and none have managed to better it yet. </p>
 <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">A truly perfect <em>Call of Duty</em> game, and one that has yet to be matched in the 12 years since its release. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review.874863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I have played Sins of a Solar Empire 2, and I am poorer for it. This sequel is extremely similar to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/15/sins-of-a-solar-empire-review">original real-time 4X strategy game</a> from 2008 (including a lot, but not all of the content from its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/13/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion-review">2012 Rebellion expansion</a>) with nicer graphics and needed engine improvements. That alone is more than welcome for a game that’s had such staying power, and revamps to its well-differentiated and complex factions give them even more depth to explore. However, the version that stealth-launched out of early access on the Epic Games Store feels rougher and less complete than a lot of games when they launch <em>into</em> early access. Expanding my empire, conquering planets, and watching my fleets do battle with rivals and bomb their planets to ash did grow on me a bit once a friend and I worked together and eventually taught ourselves its ins and outs, but getting to that point was so much less fun than it should’ve been that any joy was sucked out of it like atmosphere through a hull breach.</p><p>For context, I played Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion a fair amount a decade ago, and have been playing 4X and real-time strategy games habitually long before and since. And yet, after buying Sins of a Solar Empire 2 and jumping in, I felt completely lost. There are no tutorials for this enormously complex game (outside of a website with a quick-start guide that’s barely more than a glossary), and the in-game instructions you do get for things as relatively simple as climbing the research tree to unlock essential technologies often send you on wild goose chases through the confusing interface. For every ounce of interstellar entertainment I managed to laboriously mine like metal from an asteroid, there was always some major headache to accompany it. Between that sort of thing, bugs, grayed-out options in the map creation interface, and a lack of a server browser to play with people you don’t know, it clearly isn’t a finished product. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Sins of a Solar Empire 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>There is no way to talk about how Sins of a Solar Empire 2 ended up like this without addressing its strange exit from early access at some uncertain point earlier this year – a warning label it really shouldn’t have dropped in its current state. After arriving on the Epic Games Store back in early 2022 as a “technical preview,” it recently removed all caveats from its store page without so much as an official press release. Instead, the publisher, Stardock, has announced a Steam launch date for this August, which promises a major patch that will include significant new features, such as the third race called the Advent and its two factions that are already listed as playable on the store page but are currently nowhere to be found. </p><p>In comments around that announcement, Stardock CEO Brad Wardell stated that you “only get one shot at a Steam release,” (where the vast majority of PC games are sold). So the plan is to wait until then to get the word out properly. It’s not a crazy idea: any strategy game enjoyer will tell you that you should save your limited resources for the moment they’ll have the maximum effect, and the same is true of game marketing dollars. But while that may sound reasonable from a business perspective, the reality is quite misleading for anyone looking to play Sins of a Solar Empire 2 who stumbles across the Epic Games Store page right now. This isn’t some hypothetical misunderstanding, either: my friend and I actually did spend a while looking for the Advent as we played. Did we have to unlock them? Enable an option in some menu? Play a couple games with the other races first? Nope. They’re just not there yet. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As of today, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is about as barebones as can be.</p></div><p>I’d like to tell you the rest of it is better, but as of today Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is about as barebones as can be considering how many systems are packed in on top of combat, including diplomacy, trade, culture spread, and pirate bounties among others. It’s disappointing that there’s no story campaign – there isn’t one in the original Sins of the Solar Empire, either, and it proved it didn’t require one any more than Civilization or Stellaris do, but it’s long been a fan-requested feature and it might’ve gone a long way toward gradually introducing us to how everything works rather than throwing you into the deep end. Instead, it took me and a friend several hours of fumbling through a couple of games against the AI to nail down how one of the two human factions even worked, and again, we’re both RTS and 4X veterans. </p><p>Once, when I was trying to build something I had insufficient research points for as the alien Vasari race, I was told to build more orbital labs. The problem is that you don’t get research points for building orbital labs – they just speed up your research <em>rate</em>. You get the actual research points by buying upgrades on each planet’s development tracker menu, but you’d never know that unless you happened to mouse over the tooltip on the right button instead of doing what you’re told to do. </p><p>Sometimes buttons don’t seem to do anything at all… until they do. Here’s an example: the construction ships you get from colonizing planets have a button literally labeled “Build Structure,” but clicking it has no discernable effect because nothing you click on afterward, be it a planet, ship, asteroid, or anything else will give you the option to build something… unless you click on an orbital structure that’s already queued to be built, which then tells the ship to prioritize that building over any others in the queue. If you actually want to build a new building, you’ll select it from a separate menu; the ship will build it without you ever having to control it directly. </p><p>It’s a problem that the interface is confusing because you'll spend a lot of Sins of a Solar Empire 2 in menus. When you’re not grouping your ships into fleets and ordering them to jump from one planet’s gravity well to the next or focus their fire on an enemy capital ship, you’re going into a menu, clicking a button, and waiting for the thing you’re researching or the ship you’re building to complete, and then you’ll click another button in another menu and wait some more. That’s fine because that's just the kind of game Sins is – it has as much or more in common with Crusader Kings 3 as it does with StarCraft 2, so there’s very little micromanagement of individual units beyond retreating them as they’re damaged or triggering capital ship abilities manually. Managing an efficient build order offers satisfying challenges, but you want those challenges to be about interesting choices rather than figuring out how to make them in the first place.</p><p>Through hours of experimentation, I finally discovered that the developers at Ironclad have actually added some nice quality-of-life features to the interface. If you want to build or research something but don't have the necessary prerequisites, the Intelligent Construction System will queue all of the things you need up to be researched in order and let you check their progress in real-time. The new Empire Management screen lets you, well… manage everything in your sinful solar empire – planets, fleets, starbases, the whole space enchilada – from one page. That beats the heck out of clicking around the star system for each of them, shortcuts or not. </p><p>Then there's the new Fleet Management System, which allows you to request reinforcements for any of your specific fleets directly from that fleet's menu – no heading back to a planet to queue them up and setting the rally point required. New ships are then built at the closest factory and rallied to that fleet automatically (though you can opt for traditional rally points if that's more your speed). These are all good, smart additions that make Sins of a Solar Empire 2 easier and more engaging to play, once you figure them out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the fun combat stuff is saved for the late game.</p></div><p>When it comes to space combat, the basic idea hasn’t changed: you mostly build big fleets and throw them at your opponent, then watch them duke it out in entertainingly flashy battles that – as you’d hope – put the original Sins’ to shame in terms of detail and ship behavior. Instead of ships largely lining up and plinking away at the other side until someone explodes like a Civil War reenactment in space, we now have smaller classes that dart around like large fighters, and larger ships are loaded with gun turrets that swivel to track targets, bringing much more of a sense of action. Long-range missiles can be intercepted by point defenses or blocked by other ships before they hit something expensive, which is a nice nibble of tactical depth for those looking to micro something. And at the top of the Warfare tech tree sits the Titan, a single enormous, faction-specific behemoth that can take on entire fleets by itself. Watching all of these ships shooting all these different weapons, exploding, and making emergency phase jumps out of a system before their hull points tick down to zero looks pretty cool when you’re zoomed in, but early skirmishes with basic units are generally pretty dull.</p><p>Like its predecessor, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 saves most of the fun stuff for the late game when you unlock tech that can do a lot of damage in a hurry. The pinnacle of that is the human’s Novalith cannon, which can shoot massive, literally world-ending shells across the solar system and take out enemy planets in one hit, as opposed to bombarding them into submission with a fleet after bashing through whatever turrets or starbases the enemy has built up to defend it. That’s awesome normally, but it’s even more so (and way funnier) when you have two Novaliths target the enemy’s home planet – you know, just to be sure – and eliminate them from the match without ever moving a fleet into orbit. Then you’ve got the Vasari’s Orkulus starbase, which is essentially just a bigger, angrier version of the Cylon Basestar from Battlestar Galactica. Armed to the absolute teeth and containing several support fighters, it’s all but unstoppable by conventional weapons and, once you upgrade it, it can jump to other planets like a spaceship. Nasty.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking of the two current races, they’re fairly different from one another, which means there’s a lot of learning to do but also a ton of opportunity to experiment with tactics and strategies geared toward their strengths. The human Trader Emergency Coalition (TEC), for instance, needs credits to manage their economy and build things. The super-advanced alien Vasari don’t, though money gives them access to the galactic markets where they can buy resources. There are unique ships and structures for each race, including several that are unique to one of their two sub-factions. The TEC, for instance, currently has the only ship that repairs others on the fly, while the Vasari can build Phase Gates that allow them to immediately jump between planets that aren’t connected by phase lanes. </p><p>That’s taken even further by some of the biggest additions to Sins of a Solar Empire 2, such as the Empire System bonuses. The TEC’s Trade Port structures were in the original game and provided a steady stream of credits, but now they allow you to allocate points to boost your production of metal, crystal, or credits on the fly. The Vasari, meanwhile, can build all-new Phase Resonators that let you allocate points to upgrade ships, their research rate, and so on. I love these additions; they add some spice to each race’s already distinct flavor while offering interesting strategic choices that allow you to build your economy or military in cool, unique ways.</p><p>Drilling down further into the subfactions, there are a lot of options to suit different playstyles. The Loyalist TEC, for instance, are more defensive, gaining access to planetary garrisons of ships that are produced automatically and don’t take up population cap, but have limited range. They can also build two starbases around a planet instead of one, which can make conquering their systems an especially difficult nut to crack. The TEC Rebels, however, are much more about offense: They get the aforementioned planet-destroying Novalith cannon, can ally with pirate factions and build a pirate base in a system they control, get economic bonuses for going on the attack, and can use propaganda abilities to make their ships more effective in combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your chosen faction makes a big difference in how you play.</p></div><p>The Vasari are similarly divided between defensive and offensive factions. The Exodus are here for a good time, not a long time, so they’re happy to force humans into labor camps, strip mine the cores of planets they don’t need, and gain resources by destroying things. The Alliance, meanwhile, is all about fostering cooperation with other races, trade, and good table manners. They want to put down roots and stick around for the long term.</p><p>These distinctions sound subtle, but they make a big difference in how you play (and serve as the majority of the lore you’ll find). I was more fond of the Rebels for the TEC because I tend to prefer an aggressive playstyle, and in my experience, purely defending in Sins of a Solar Empire 2 isn’t going to win you the war. Like any good – sorry, <em>successful</em> – empire, you have to expand or you’ll eventually get overwhelmed. But when I needed to hold out long enough so my teammate could provide support against the two AI opponents I was facing down, those Loyalist garrisons sure did come in handy. With the Vasari, though, I much preferred making alliances with the Minor Factions (small AI players who don’t expand) and supporting my teammate, though I had a couple of nasty fleets capturing planets by the end. I like that the Factions provide so much variety, and when Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works, it feels good (mechanically, not morally) to build your empire up, expand, and conquer your neighbors.</p><p>And, in a nice touch, there are a lot of options for map generation, ranging from recommended player counts (between two and 10) on procedurally generated star systems to specific scenarios with unique challenges. Most of that is carried over from the original, but Sins of a Solar Empire 2 introduces planets and other astral bodies that rotate around stars, which can open up new phase lanes between them when they get close enough. That sounds a bit cooler than it is in practice because it can take hours for rotations to sync up in a way that truly matters (and on smaller maps, it might never happen at all), but when the stars literally align it can let you hit an enemy with a surprise attack on a world they thought was protected by heavily defended neighbors. You have a Future Orbits button that shows you how phase lanes will change for up to an hour into the future, so it’s not left up to chance or guesswork. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Will's Favorite RTS/4X Games</h3><p>Playing Sins of a Solar Empire 2 made me reflect on some of my favorite RTS and 4X games. Here they are.</p></div><p>But, man, so many things just feel incomplete or underbaked. Take the Minor Factions, for instance. You gain favor with them – and special bonuses – by spending Influence Points; when I was playing the Vasari Alliance, Influence Points were easy to get, so I earned lots of bonuses, but once I’d more or less unlocked everything I could only use the points to bid on auctions for resources. Being buddy-buddy with a Minor Faction doesn’t really do anything for you aside from getting you some abilities and making it so they’re (sometimes?) not actively hostile. Like most things in Sins of a Solar Empire 2, it’s hard to tell because there’s not much in-game to clue you in until you’ve pieced together a lot of disparate tooltips and experimented enough to find the right answer.</p><p>Then there are the bugs. I’ve already mentioned misleading audio cues telling me to build the wrong thing, but I’ve also had incorrect notifications telling me an enemy had conquered a planet I’d just colonized and so I spent a minute trying to figure out what happened before realizing, “Oh, it was me who conquered the planet, actually.” Once, I started a team game with a friend where we were clearly set to be allied, only to be told we weren’t once we got into the match, forcing us to fix it in-game. </p><p>There are also entire menu options grayed out that control things like “Orbiting Planet Speed,” or “Research Rates,” or “Ship Build Rates” when you try to adjust pre-game settings – you know, things you might like some say in when you’re setting up a match – that just aren’t available. There’s a tooltip telling you that these options are disabled “as we collect balance feedback,” which is fair, but these limitations just drive home how unfinished everything is. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it works, it really works - it just needs to get us there with less frustration.</p></div><p>All of that said, when Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works, it really works. There's a lot of nuance when it comes to choosing your upgrade paths, deciding which structures to build on your planets, how to spend each planet’s limited orbital slots, and constructing your fleets. Do you go for an economic opening or a military one? Which capital ship do you start with, and why? What upgrades do you give it? What kind of research do you prioritize? Do you trade with other players, or buy the resources you need on the market? How much, if at all, do you engage with the Minor Factions on the map? If a battle looks like it will come down to the wire, do you pull your fleet out and live to fight another day, or go all in and bet on the victory?</p><p>The consequences of those choices, and the choices your opponents make in response to them, determine how games play out. The right decision at the right time – even one as seemingly small as prioritizing one research upgrade over another or choosing a specific capital ship to lead your first fleet – can snowball and make all the difference in an interplanetary power struggle that can last for a dozen hours or more. In its best moments, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 understands that, and that makes for compelling, memorable matches. It just needs to get us there much faster and with less frustration along the way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The latest episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> Season 14 dropped onto streaming services on May 17. While the episode is undeniably mostly filler, one thing happened that has sparked discussion among eager Whovians—the Doctor’s next companion made a rather large appearance.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">In the third episode of the latest season, ‘Boom’, written by Steven Moffat, the Doctor and Ruby find themselves on a wartorn planet where the Doctor runs headfirst into danger, directly onto a landmine. Cue an entire episode where he can’t move while the action comes to him. Like I said, it’s mainly filler.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Of course there are some key moments worth paying attention to, such as the fifth known re-appearance of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-showrunner-russel-t-davies-confirms-the-importance-of-susan-twists-reappearances/">Susan Twist</a>, who plays the AI Ambulance in Boom, and the mysterious snow which seems to fall around Ruby at strange moments.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">However, the biggest thing to come out of Boom is the fact that, ahead of her becoming the Doctor’s next Companion in season 15, Veradu Sethu made an appearance as what could be considered a main character in the episode.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">I won’t go into too much detail about her role in the episode, but she plays an ordained soldier named Mundy Flynn (which was the source of a strangely timed joke about how she should marry Ruby and become “Mundy Sunday”), taking part in the war that’s currently ravaging the planet. Of course, she faces some heartbreak and tough decisions in the episode, but the question on the minds of Whovians everywhere is why is she here, and will she still be playing Mundy when she returns in season 15?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Let’s face it: this is <em>Doctor Who</em>, where even the Doctor himself admits that everything is possible, so Verada could come back as literally anyone else. We even have some precedent for that, given Jenna Coleman’s multiple roles before debuting as Clara proper. </p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">However, the Doctor did openly say that he would be popping back to the planet to visit again at some point. Regardless, it was interesting to see the next companion before we have to get used to them being around for the long haul next season.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="false">The news that Verada would play the next companion, alongside current companion Ruby, came in April 2024. The actress has previously appeared in Jurassic World Dominion and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68802766">has said</a> that it’s an ‘honour’ to be included in the cast of <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="255" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Mountain Dew x Final Fantasy XIV</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-ffxiv-x-mountain-dew-rewards-merch-and-how-to-redeem-points/">promotion</a> has taken the gaming world by storm, causing the birth of <a href="https://x.com/ColinRyan/status/1791190990868369802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memes</a> and discussion across the internet. However, one thing seems to be drawing more attention than anything else at the moment — Big Sippin.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Big Sippin is <em>Mountain Dew</em>’s in-game character mascot for the promotion. A level 81 (at the time of writing) Bard, dressed entirely in green and setting out on his adventures across Eorzea. Players have begun to <a href="https://x.com/MTNDEWGaming/status/1791202741248811209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obsessively stalk his FC house</a> (the FC is called House of Sippin, for those interested, and the house is located on Hyperion – Goblet, Ward 21, Plot 9 – if you want to join in the stalking), and <em>Mountain Dew</em> is sharing Big Sippin’s progress over on their Twitter page.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey gamers, Big Sippin is live in <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FF_XIV_EN</a> right now!</p><p>He’ll be at the Mtn Dew House for a bit, then heading out to start his FFXIV adventure.

 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">For those who don’t know, to be considered a Legacy Player, the player must have played Final Fantasy XIV for at least 90 days prior to the Eighth Umbral Calamity and the release of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> back in 2013. This has raised some questions, and my love for researching strange events led me down a bit of a weird wormhole looking for answers.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="152" data-injectable="false">The reason that people are starting to think that Big Sippin might be a Legacy Player is down to two things which can be found on his <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/52996912/#profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lodestone profile</a>:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false"> <li>They have the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Cait_Sith_Doll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cait Sith Doll</a> minion, which was only ever available as a pre-order bonus for A Realm Reborn</li> <li>They have a <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Legacy_Chocobo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy Chocobo</a> mount, which is only owned by players who were around pre-A Realm Reborn</li> </ul> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">Now, I’m going to be honest and say that I’m 99% sure that Big Sippin is not a true Legacy Player. For starters, he only has three DoW/DoM Jobs unlocked (Bard at level 81, Sage at level 70, and Conjurer at level 22), and I’m wholly convinced that Bard has been level skipped in order to be used for <em>Mountain Dew</em>‘s promotional purposes. </p>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">The Soul Stone for Bard is green, so it fits the theme. Sage unlocks at level 70, so there’s no progression there and while it does look like Big Sippin has at least played a little as Conjurer, he hasn’t progressed far enough to gain his <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-equip-soul-crystal-job-stone-in-ffxiv/">Soul Stone</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="false">It’s more likely that this is a loaner account from Square Enix that was used for testing purposes or similar before A Realm Reborn was released. Or, if you want me to don my tin foil hat, this could just be a new account with a couple of red herring items added to spark conversation amongst players who look into it. If that’s the case, then I guess it worked because here we are.</p>

<p data-characters="143" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As soon as fiction began introducing absurdly powerful heroes, fans started needing to pit them against each other to determine who would win. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">These battles take place in crossover scenarios that would likely never happen — even if only because that kind of defeats the purpose of them being the good guys. Still, here’s the only ranking on the Internet that tells you with pinpoint accuracy who the most powerful hero in all of fiction is.</p> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Sony</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">10. Kratos </h2> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Kratos was always strong, but what made him powerful to the point of challenging the gods was a deal he made with one. He received immense power from Ares, but that power came with a blinding rage that cost Kratos everyone he loved. He set out to get revenge against one god but then ended up killing the entirety of Mount Olympus and pretty much every Norse God in existence. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="true">The only argument you can have against Kratos from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-god-of-war-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God Of War</a></em> as being one of the most powerful characters in existence is the fact that he dies three times in his series. Then again, dying only really helps set him up to kick the ass of whoever’s working as the warden of hell at that point and return even stronger, so maybe he really does belong on this list.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Doom Slayer </h2> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">The original <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-doom-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>DOOM</em> games</a> play like a horror movie where humans pay for messing with the wrong thing. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>DOOM</em> reboot</a> from 2016 turns the tables and has the demon horde as the dumbasses that open the wrong sarcophagus and unleash something that they cannot deal with: the Doom Slayer.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">The Doom Slayer is what the biggest and baddest demons in the <em>DOOM</em> universe see in their nightmares at 666 in the evening. He’s like a version of Kratos who has guns and who can make use of interstellar travel to get close enough to perform a glory kill on any demonic entity in the universe. Also, he already spends most of his time in hell, so dying and being sent there would feel more like waking up from a nap than a proper respawn — not that he would die, anyway.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Asura </h2> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s a tremendous game, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-asuras-wrath/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asura’s Wrath</a></em> doesn’t <em>ever</em> play like a regular game. You play as a god here, and a true god doesn’t care for the tiny zombies that Kratos and the Doom Guy need to kill in their respective games’ early levels—unless there are a million of them at once. </p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">Every level in <em>Asura’s Wrath</em> is a set piece of enormous proportions where Asura has to go against Akuma, giants, entire fleets of combat spaceships, or even planet-sized gods. If the Doom Slayer is the sci-fi version of Kratos, then Asura is the anime version of Kratos, which naturally means he’s at least an order of magnitude above in terms of power and wildness.</p> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-7-kirby" data-injectable="false">7. Kirby</h2> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Kirby’s power level isn’t immediately obvious, but he’s a wildcard of such magnitude that you just cannot help but respect it. It’s almost impossible to make a list of all his abilities because they make up new ones whenever a new Kirby game comes out, but he’s basically able to eat anyone (or anything) and gain their powers.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">If you want more clear proof of Kirby’s power, just look at the trailer for <a href="https://youtu.be/WShCN-AYHqA"><em>Super Smash Bros.</em> <em>World Of Light</em></a>. It shows Galeem, the god who controls the master hands, wiping out an entire galaxy — the galaxy where <em>every</em> character you’ve ever seen in <em>SSMB</em> lives — but failing to even put a bruise on Kirby. You don’t mess with that kind of power.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. Superman </h2> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">When not failing to fly through some hoops because of bad controls, Superman is your quintessential strong character. he’s the character every comic book hero cribs from, whether they realize it or not. </p>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">Superman is SO strong, in fact, that it works against him. Many complaints from modern fans are that he’s boring because there are so few instances when someone was able to present him with an interesting physical challenge. </p> <figure data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Goku </h2> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">While kid Goku from the original <em>Dragon Ball</em> would likely take no more than one half-charged slap from Superman to explode and die, the same definitely doesn’t apply to <em>DBZ’s</em> Goku.<em> </em>I believe there’s one point in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dragon-ball-fighterz/">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, likely the time when Goku first reaches SSJ, when Goku just leaves Superman in the dust and never returns.</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">I’ve read very detailed scientific number crunches detailing how Superman is actually stronger than Goku, but here’s the thing: you’ve picked the only place where science doesn’t matter. Frieza’s weakest form was able to conjure enough energy to destroy a planet in one of his fingers, and Goku still slapped his final form silly. </p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">Goku’s biggest advantage? A genetic trait that makes him stronger whenever he gets beat. Do you know who also shares that genetic trait? Doomsday, the only creature who ever killed Superman, and it wasn’t even powerful enough to destroy a planet with a finger gun.</p> <figure data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. Vegito</h2> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">I know Vegito is half-Goku, so that may invalidate his form for this tournament, but he’s here to prove a point and also too strong for me to just push away.</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Vegito, who is a fusion of Vegeta and Goku using the Potara Earrings, is significantly stronger than Goku alone. Even though no character in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> can match up to him, he avoids becoming boring simply because the mix between Goku and Vegeta’s personalities makes him too funny not to enjoy.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by DC</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Dr. Manhattan </h2> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">Dr. Manhattan’s powers go well beyond those of mere strength. This is a being so powerful he can end or create life in an instant. He exists at the current moment but also in all moments. Dr. Manhattan is an omnipotent being above all beings, which might somehow make him the most human character in <em>Watchmen</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">His only weakness comes not from any imaginable lack of power but rather from having too much of it. By the time of <em>Watchmen</em>‘s event, Dr. Manhattan has gone so far past the line separating humans from deities that he no longer feels empathy for humankind. </p> <figure data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">2. Saitama</h2> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Impossibly powerful “gag” characters aren’t a new thing —children and Reddit users come up with them every day. Still, It’s not common for a gag character to get promoted to the main character role in a legit and spectacular anime. </p> <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">Saitama feels like an alien even in the incredibly wild world of <em>One Punch Man,</em> as he goes through the suffering that a real human who’s too good at his job would, but keeps the invulnerability that only a joke character would have. Though he’s known for finishing off any enemy with one single punch, no aspect of Saitama is bound to any sort of power or ability ruleset, meaning that he’ll always be more powerful than whatever enemy you put in front of him.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by American Comics Group</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">1. Herbie Popnecker </h2> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">The most powerful character on the list is, interestingly, the least famous one. Herbie Popnecker dates back to the ’50s, and his powers are, well, <a href="https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Herbie_Popnecker">pretty much all of them.</a> He’s capable of teleportation, but also he can just walk anywhere in the universe. Herbie is so strong he tends not to notice even when incredibly powerful beings are physically attempting to kill him. Also, he can communicate with animals, and ghosts are afraid of him.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">I cannot say that this is the first godlike gag character in history, but he’s at least the most influential one. If you love Saitama, which you should, know that he might only exist because of Herbie, and that’s why he’s not number one.</p> <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="false">Don’t agree with my pick for number one? Well, I only even know of Herbie because he’s <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/comics/the-debut-of-alan-moores-favorite-comic-character-up-for-auction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the favorite hero of <em>Watchmen</em> creator Alan Moore</a>, so good luck taking it up with him.</p>

<p data-characters="467" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/">30+ year lifespan of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, countless mechanics, creatures, and even crossovers have been added to the game. Despite all of the changes and additions throughout the decades, MTG has maintained the same five mana colors. Each mana color represents vastly different playstyles and can be combined to create 25 different color combinations. These color combinations have been given lore-inspired nicknames, which gives each deck its own identity.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">You aren’t required to know the name associated with your deck, but it can help when searching for decks online or watching the <a href="https://magic.gg/pro-tour">Magic Pro Tour</a> since decks are commonly referred to by their combination name. Most websites will organize decks by combination name + archetype, such as “Esper Midrange” or “Boros Convoke.”&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-all-color-combination-names-in-mtg-explained" data-injectable="false">All color combination names in MTG explained</h2> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">The most basic decks in MTG use only a single mana color. These decks are simply referred to as mono-color decks. An example of this would be mono-red decks, which focus entirely on the aggressive, low-cost cards that Red specializes in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">When combining multiple colors, names taken from the lore of Magic: The Gathering represent each combination. It’s essential to learn a few different concepts to understand the naming conventions used for the various color combinations. </p> <h3 id="h-what-letters-represent-each-mana-color" data-injectable="false">What letters represent each mana color?</h3> <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">With the exception of Blue, each mana color in MTG can be referred to by the first letter of its name:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true"> <li>G – Green</li> <li>R – Red</li> <li>W – White</li> <li>B – Black</li> <li>U – Blue (since Black and Blue share “B” and “L”, Blue goes by U)</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-what-are-allied-and-enemy-colors-in-mtg" data-injectable="false">What are allied and enemy colors in MTG?</h3> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Each of the five mana colors represents a different playstyle in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Some mechanics or abilities are unique to a particular mana color which helps provide each color’s identity within the game. Some of the strategies for the colors work well together, while others clash and are more difficult to combine within a deck; These are known as “<strong>allied</strong>” and “<strong>enemy</strong>” colors.&nbsp;</p>
 <h4 id="h-allied-colors" data-injectable="false">Allied colors</h4> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">Allied colors have roughly the same strategy within MTG. One of the most popular allied color combinations is known as “Azorius Control,” which consists of Blue and White. White mana cards contain a large amount of hard removal spells such as “Exile” and “Destroy” cards. Blue mana cards are known for counterspells and “Draw” cards which ensure that players always have a spell up their sleeve. The combination of Blue and White allows for complete control over the battlefield.</p>
 <h4 id="h-enemy-colors" data-injectable="false">Enemy colors</h4> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, enemy colors have vastly different strategies and aren’t as easy to combine within a single deck. An example of this would be an “Izzet Spellslinger” deck that pairs the control spells from Blue with the aggressive nature of Red creatures. While the strategies of the colors contrast each other, the inclusion of Blue spells offers staying power to the Red creatures which otherwise wouldn’t have many defensive options.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Allied and enemy decks aren’t better or worse than each other. Rather, they are something to keep in mind when determining a deck’s overall strategy. Allied colors have similar strategies and are much easier to pull off when given the opportunity. However, they also share similar weaknesses that your opponents can exploit. Enemy colors aren’t as focused as allied colors, but as seen in the example above, enemy colors can cover each other’s weaknesses much better than allied colors can.&nbsp;</p>
 <h4 id="h-how-to-determine-allied-and-enemy-colors" data-injectable="false">How to determine allied and enemy colors</h4> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Figuring out what colors are considered allies or enemies of each other is simple. On the back of each MTG card, the five mana colors are arranged into a pentagon. For any given color, the two colors adjacent are known as allied colors, while the two colors opposite of it are enemy colors. An example of this would be Blue being adjacent to White and Black (Allied) but opposite to Green and Red (Enemy).&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-list-of-all-color-combination-names-in-magic-the-gathering-mtg" data-injectable="false">List of all color combination names in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <h3 id="h-mtg-s-two-color-combination-names" data-injectable="false">MTG’s two-color combination names</h3> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">Across every format in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, most decks are pairs of two mana colors. The original Ravnica block sets were focused on guilds that each had a pair of mana colors as their identity. Since then, the names of these guilds have been used to refer to each of the 10 two-color combinations.</p>
 <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="48" data-injectable="false">MTG’s two-color combinations (<strong>Ravnica guilds</strong>):</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Azorius</strong> – Blue/White (UW)</li> <li><strong>Boros</strong> – Red/White (RW)</li> <li><strong>Dimir</strong> – Blue/Black (UB)</li> <li><strong>Golgari</strong> – Black/Green (BG)</li> <li><strong>Gruul </strong>– Green/Red (GR)</li> <li><strong>Izzet </strong>– Blue/Red (UR)</li> <li><strong>Orzhov</strong> – Black/White (BW)</li> <li><strong>Rakdos</strong> – Black/Red (BR)</li> <li><strong>Selesnya</strong> – Green/White (GW)</li> <li><strong>Simic</strong> – Blue/Green (UG)</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-mtg-s-three-color-combination-names" data-injectable="false">MTG’s three-color combination names</h3> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">While three-color combinations don’t have the iconic guilds of Ravnica to be named after, they do have two different naming sources of their own. Remember the allied and enemy colors we explained earlier? The three-color combinations in Magic: The Gathering are organized into two different types based on allied and enemy colors:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true"> <li>The allied colors are named after shards from the 2008 <strong>Shards of Alara</strong> block.&nbsp;</li> <li>The enemy colors are named after the five clans from the 2014 <strong>Khans of Tarkir</strong> block.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="71" data-current-count="71" data-injectable="false">Here are the names of the allied three-color combinations in MTG:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Bant</strong> – Blue/Green/White </li> <li><strong>Esper</strong> – Black/Blue/White </li> <li><strong>Grixis</strong> – Black/Blue/Red </li> <li><strong>Jund</strong> – Black/Green/Red </li> <li><strong>Naya</strong> – Green/Red/White </li> </ul> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Here are the names of the enemy three-color combinations in MTG:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Abzan</strong> – Black/Green/White </li> <li><strong>Jeskai</strong> – Blue/Red/White </li> <li><strong>Mardu</strong> – Black/Red/White </li> <li><strong>Sultai</strong> – Black/Blue/Green </li> <li><strong>Temur </strong>– Blue/Green/Red </li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-mtg-s-four-color-combination-names" data-injectable="false">MTG’s four-color combination names</h3> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">There are only five different four-color combinations in Magic: The Gathering. Just like the two-color combinations, the nicknames for these come from the Ravnica block. But instead of the combinations being named after guilds, they’re named after the first word used in the names of the four-color creatures known as the <strong>Nephilim</strong>. These creatures are:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"> <li>Dune-Brood Nephilim</li> <li>Glint-Eye Nephilim</li> <li>Ink-Treader Nephilim</li> <li>Witch-Maw Nephilim</li> <li>Yore-Tiller Nephilim</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="57" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Here are the names of the four-color combinations in MTG:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Dune</strong> – Black/Green/Red/White (No Blue)</li> <li><strong>Glint</strong> – Black/Blue/Green/Red (No White)</li> <li><strong>Ink</strong> – Blue/Green/Red/White (No Black)</li> <li><strong>Witch</strong> – Black/Blue/Green/White (No Red)</li> <li><strong>Yore</strong> – Black/Blue/Red/White (No Green)</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-mtg-s-five-color-combination-name" data-injectable="false">MTG’s Five-color combination name</h3> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Last but not least, the five-color combination name has a simpler approach than the other combinations. Many players simply say “all colors” or “rainbow” when referring to these decks. But you can also find some players that refer to the five-color combination as “WUBRG” (woo-berg) after the letters that represent each of the colors.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In an interview about his plans for Stardew Valley's following its recent 1.6 update, Barone said that he doesn't feel pressured to create a follow-up game, stating: "It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it".</p>

<p>"[Fan expectation] definitely puts pressure on me," Barone told <a href="https://aftermath.site/stardew-valley-concernedape-haunted-chocolatier-interview">Aftermath</a>. "But it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time. When it's ready, that's when I'll release it. I'm not too concerned with the pressure. I don't feel like I owe anyone anything when it comes to Haunted Chocolatier. It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it.</p>
<p>"Before making Stardew Valley, I spent all day hunched over the computer," Barone added. "I still spend all day hunched over the computer... My goal in life isn't about making money. I want to create things and share them with the world. That's what it's all about. That's what I'm doing. That's what I will do, regardless of any other circumstances, as long as I can financially support myself to be able to do that. If I couldn't, I would get a job and spend my free time creating stuff to try to get back to doing that."</p>
<p>Last October, Barone celebrated one million followers by sharing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-shares-new-screenshots-of-haunted-chocolatier">four previously unseen screenshots of Haunted Chocolatier</a>.</p>
<p>Shared on X, formerly Twitter, the four screenshots show some new areas: an interior home and shop, a vivid forest, a mermaid fountain in (presumably) the town square, and a creepy library with a peering skeleton.</p>
<p>That forest screenshot also shows the character shooting at a leafy creature with a bow and arrow, suggestive of the increased combat focus compared with Stardew.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you feel like getting into epic fantasy is a bit of a chore these days due to the sheer number of well-recommended book series out there, we’re here to tell you that there are a ton of brilliant novels, often standalone, that can serve as a starting point for beginners.</p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">Fantasy enthusiasts have an inclination to throw huge book series at readers who may simply want to dip their toes into the genre. Many have come to believe all High Fantasy or Epic Fantasy has to offer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fantasy-book-series-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are enormous 1000-page novels</a> that seem closer to a scholarly endeavor than escapism. </p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">For this article, we have put together a list of 10 highly acclaimed books that can serve as an entry point to your Epic Fantasy journey. We’ve decided to leave out certain names you almost certainly already know, like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, or even well-known series like <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and <em>His Dark Materials</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">That’s not to say the following titles are obscure. But they are all exactly what you need to wrap your head around the genre, its history and legacy, its tropes and themes, and what it has to offer in storytelling and literary terms. Here are some of the best fantasy books for beginners.</p> <figure data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>via William Morrow Paperbacks</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">10. <strong>Stardust by Neil Gaiman</strong></h2> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">Beyond count is the number of fantasy books dealing with the faerie world, but few have become an instant classic in this lately inundated genre. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true"><em>Stardust</em> by Neil Gaiman is the perfect blend of the magical and the lyrical, pushing readers down a literary rabbit hole full of analogies, archetypes, and symbolism. You follow Tristan Thorn, who enters a fairy tale world in search of a fallen star for his beloved Victoria, little knowing that the journey will fundamentally change his self-perception and identity.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via HarperCollins</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. <strong>Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones</strong></h2> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="true">You’ve probably seen Studio Ghibli’s <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em>, an anime adaptation of the 1986 novel by British author Diana Wynne Jones. The acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki flick now finds itself among the top 10 lists everywhere, but reading the book can also prove to be an unforgettable experience. Diana’s witty prose and exceptional storytelling and characterization chops have turned <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> into a timeless classic.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Ace</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">8. <strong>Elric of Melniboné by Michael Moorcock</strong></h2> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">If J.R.R. Tolkien is the father of High Fantasy, then Michel Moorcock’s Elric of Melniboné is akin to the father of modern characterization for fantasy protagonists. Elric may be severely underrated today, but his legend as Moorcock’s so-called “Eternal Champion” hearkens back to mythologies as old as human civilization. </p>
 <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Following the tale of its titular protagonist — who is the last emperor of the decaying island kingdom of powerful sorcerers, Melniboné — the <em>Elric Saga </em>is chock-full of amazing character moments, compelling plotlines, and dark narrative themes, with Moorcock often being referred to as one of the original grimdark fantasy spinners who subverted Tolkien. Dozens of other prominent grimdark fantasy authors like George R.R. Martin, Stephen R. Donaldson, Glen Cook, Steven Erikson, and Andrzej Sapkowski have since taken inspiration from Elric of Melniboné.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Ace</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">7. <strong>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle</strong></h2> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Whimsical, unexpected, and beautiful. These words perfectly capture what it feels like to read <em>The Last Unicorn </em>by Peter S. Beagle. Now a classic of the genre, this 1968 fantasy novel explores themes like love, mortality and nature, wrapped inside a perfect story with lyrical prose, following the adventures of a unicorn who is led to believe that she’s the last of her kind. </p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false"><em>The Last Unicorn </em>is not only an epitome of everything the fantasy genre has to offer but has also been a huge wellspring of inspiration for many other popular fantasy authors today, namely Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Patrick Rothfuss.</p> <figure data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>via Orbit</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">6. <strong>Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames</strong></h2> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">What High Fantasy often distinctly lacks is a sense of humor. I’m not talking about lighthearted character moments or a bit of witty banter between protagonists, but a properly rib-tickling and humorous novel set in a fantasy world. Besides Terry Pratchett’s <em>Discworld</em>, only a handful of authors have attempted to write such a story, and fewer still have managed to make it work. </p> <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="969" data-injectable="true">Nicholas Eames is one of those people, and his book <em>Kings of the Wyld </em>is a great retreat for readers who want a story that doesn’t take itself too seriously. <em>Kings of the Wyld </em>follows the adventures of a retired band of mercenaries (heavily inspired by old-school rock and roll bands) who break off their retirement to save the daughter of one of their members. But time and age make milksops of us all, even if you used to be a fearsome warrior of legend, and no band reunion in history, be it music or something else entirely, has ever managed to recapture that old flash of glory.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Penguin Random House</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. <strong>The Once and Future King by T. H. White</strong></h2> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Most fantasy stories, even Tolkien’s own Middle-earth, trace their roots to the Arthurian legend. But the problem with old and strewn mythologies is not knowing where to start. <em>The Once and Future King </em>by T. H. White takes care of that little dealbreaker by delivering a unique and modern spin on the Matter of Britain. </p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true"><em>The Once and Future King </em>unites all the different stories and accounts from works like <em>Historia Regum Britanniae </em>and Sir Thomas Malory’s <em>Le Morte d’Arthur </em>into a cohesive take on King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The tale begins with Arthur’s tutelage under the wizard Merlin and continues to explore the founding of Camelot’s ideals and other legendary tales like the quest for the Holy Grail.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Berkley Books / Harper Voyager (reissue)</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">4. <strong>Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay</strong></h2> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">Guy Gavriel Kay is probably the most underrated High Fantasy author alive. Best known for his rich world-building and intricate prose, Gavriel Kay first made a name for himself when he assisted Christopher Tolkien in editing The Silmarillion in the late ‘80s. Kay then went on to write books of his own, first The Fionavar Tapestry trilogy and then the highly acclaimed <em>Tigana</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">In this book, Kay weaves mythology and fantasy together to make a deeply complex story about the history of a civilization. It features a masterful narrative structure, many thought-provoking themes and brilliant character studies, and is now finally garnering some love for its massive influence on the genre.</p> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>via Hachette Book Group</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">3. <strong>The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski</strong></h2> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"><em>The Last Wish </em>is a collection of short stories that first introduced the world to Geralt of Rivia. <em>The Witcher </em>series of books and the consequently following video games are now a huge part of pop culture, but <em>The Last Wish </em>still stands on its own as a great gateway into modern fantasy literature. </p> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Andrzej Sapkowski writes in tandem with history and often brings in elements of folklore, especially East European folklore, to inform and develop his world. The Last Wish has excellent prose and remains, in my opinion, the best <em>Witcher </em>novel from the saga to this day. If you want a grimdark, character-focused fantasy story, then waste no time picking up <em>The Last Wish</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Gollancz</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <strong>The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson</strong></h2> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Brandon Sanderson is mostly known these days for his <em>Stormlight Archive </em>series, but the <em>Mistborn </em>trilogy, beginning with <em>The Final Empire </em>in 2006, is also very beloved in the fantasy community. </p>
 <p data-characters="556" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">The Final Empire tells the tale of a band of rebels who want to overthrow the seemingly invincible, verifiably immortal, and utterly tyrannical god emperor of their world. But there’s a catch: The tyrannical emperor, called The Lord Ruler, is actually the prophesied Hero of Ages and the man who saved the world from an enigmatic calamity known as the Deepness a thousand years ago. There’s also the fact that he’s very much invincible and untouchable, and the business of overthrowing him, justified though it may be, will not prove to be so simple.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>via Del Rey</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-spinning-silver-by-naomi-novik" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik</strong></h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true">This standalone book from 2018 tells the tale of three women who fight against fate and get thrust into a conflict with evil forces in an imaginary medieval European kingdom called Lithvas. </p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false"><em>Spinning Silver </em>is about identity, self-perception, and the consequences of human greed. Naomi Novik’s prose is poetic, her worldbuilding is top-notch, and the magic and wonder of <em>Spinning Silver </em>is reminiscent of some of the best stories in the history of the fantasy genre.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> was blessed with several excellent animated trailers, each one produced by French animation studio Bobbypills. Now the slick metroidvania is getting a full animated television series from the same folks, and the first trailer is below.

<p>It's in French, but you can turn on English subtitles. Also, the animation style is different from the trailers.

<p>I think I approve of everything about this. I like that it's not treating the subject matter overly seriosuly - because who really cares about Dead Cells lore when the game is mostly about the wonderful feeling of rolling, dashing, and exploding enemies. I like that it's a comedy. I like that several of the gags in the trailer above are derived from the animation itself. (I'd guess many Dead Cells fans will not agree with me.)
</p>
<p>The Dead Cells animated series is due to release on June 19th on ADN (France). That's the <a href="https://animationdigitalnetwork.fr/">Animation Digital Network</a>, an online streaming service. An English version is due later in the year - but it's fine, you can watch it with subtitles, don't be afraid.
</p>
<p>Dead Cells recently received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-to-receive-its-final-update-as-devs-move-on-to-new-secret-projects">its final update and DLC</a>.

<p>When you have an immensely popular first-person shooter—a genre known to draw cheaters—you’ll find that many of your rounds include a hacker or two. The more popular the game, the more money flowing behind the scenes to facilitate cheating. Unfortunately, Escape From Tarkov cheaters prove to be some of the most prevalent and dug-in bunch. Is the extraction shooter full of cheaters today?</p>



<h2 id="h-are-escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-in-every-lobby">Are Escape From Tarkov Cheaters in Every Lobby?</h2>



<p>I wouldn’t say every single lobby in Escape From Tarkov includes cheaters. Is it possible? Yeah, if you listen to the community on Reddit. Does the game have a cheater problem? Absolutely!</p>



<p>There are too many Escape From Tarkov cheaters to count, and despite Battlestate Games reportedly banning tens of thousands of them, it seems like there are more each day. How and why? We’ll dive into that more shortly. For now, however, know that Escape From Tarkov has a problem with hackers plaguing the game.</p>



<p>They use all manner of hacks commonplace in competitive first-person shooters, including wallhacks, aimbots, and speedhacks. But in Tarkov, where loot reigns supreme, you’ll find many with a vacuum-like cheat that sucks up the loot from every container in the map, then deposits it in front of the cheater. They may then pick and choose what they want while utterly untouchable. </p>



<p>How can the average player compete with hackers? You have a few options. You can report them to BSG and hope they take action, try to avoid a known cheater, and consider playing single-player. BSG themselves recently launched the PvE mode, but there’s a fantastic single-player Escape From Tarkov mod, known as SPT, that genuinely instills me with excitement to play once more!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-keep-coming-back">How Do Escape From Tarkov Cheaters Keep Coming Back?</h2>



<p>The amount of money flowing from the cheating scene proves rather tremendous on all fronts. You have cheat creators actively seeking workarounds to any anti-cheat software in their favorite games. In this case, EFT. Then, you have the cheaters themselves. They buy the cheats, use them for days or weeks before they receive a game ban, and sell the loot they receive, or even the account, for real money. Using that money, they turn around and buy another key for EFT on the cheap from a gray market website or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-buy-escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly from BSG during a sale</a> and continue the process.</p>

<p data-characters="291" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Minecraft</em> has always been about adventuring and exploring everywhere the game has to offer, stumbling upon gems like caverns, shipwrecks, and more. However, one of the most classic and vital treasures to find is the many villages. They’re full of resources and villagers to trade with.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">Since villages are so great, it makes sense that plenty of seeds will have them for you to explore. While there are plenty that are perfect for all types of gameplay, we’ve narrowed it down to the best 10 <em>Minecraft</em> village seeds for you.</p> <div data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-10-mountain-valley-double-village-seed-10532435" data-injectable="false">10. Mountain Valley Double Village (Seed: 10532435)</h2> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">What’s better than one village in a great spot for exploring? Two. This seed is the penultimate seed to begin any adventure you can think of. Nestled in a scenic mountain valley, these two villages allow you to get everything you need to start off on whatever journey you can think of and make a safe home base whenever you need somewhere familiar to return to. The true joy of <em>Minecraft</em> is adventure, of course.</p>
 </div> <div data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-9-tiered-lake-village-seed-4344633995751933050" data-injectable="false">9. Tiered Lake Village (Seed: 4344633995751933050)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">This is another seed that’s mainly just for looks instead of adventure, but that doesn’t mean it’s no fun. This seed has an amazing lake right next to it that has three tiers to it. This huge lake would make a great backdrop to a stunning mansion you can build or a lovely view for the backyard of your cozy cottage. Whatever you decide, this village seed is a great pick, no matter how you play.</p>
 <h2 id="h-8-ravine-village-seed-2467475923055248755" data-injectable="false">8. Ravine Village (Seed: 2467475923055248755)</h2> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">There’s a massive ravine that breaks most of this seed in half, and luckily the village is right on it. Not only do you get all the resources from the village itself, but all the ore you could need in the ravine below. This seed also contains plenty of different biomes that surround the village, so whatever blocks you’re looking for, you can find nearby. </p> </div> <div data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-7-sakura-and-snow-village-seed-5063885805507972583" data-injectable="false">7. Sakura and Snow Village (Seed: 5063885805507972583)</h2> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="787" data-injectable="true">If you’re looking for beauty, this is the seed you need. Right next to the village is a wonderful mix of snow biomes and cherry blossom biomes, which mix together to make a stunning place to explore. The Sakura biome was added in the 1.20 update to the game, and I’ve been unable to get enough of them since then, even as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-1-21-update-release/">1.21 update</a> is here. This village seed is fantastic for taking advantage of it. </p>
 </div> <div data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-6-shattered-savanna-village-seed-6284900741809347198" data-injectable="false">6. Shattered Savanna Village (Seed: 6284900741809347198)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">There are tons of biomes to pick from in <em>Minecraft</em>, but some are much harder to come across when exploring. With this seed, you’ll be right next to several shattered savannas or windswept savannas to explore. There are floating islands, a swamp, and two villages to enjoy. </p>
 </div> <div data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-5-underground-zombie-village-seed-2404910741640601849" data-injectable="false">5. Underground Zombie Village (Seed: -2404910741640601849)</h2> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">This seed provides a unique challenge if you’re looking for a little danger — not only are you far underground in a big cave system, but there are zombies everywhere you turn. True, this seed is not for you if you’re looking for a peaceful gameplay experience. But there’s nothing wrong with a good challenge, and this village seed is perfect for it. It’s also great if you’re looking for a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-scary-minecraft-mods/">scary</a> playthrough.</p>
 </div> <div data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-4-shipwreck-coastal-village-seed-7783854906403730143" data-injectable="false">4. Shipwreck Coastal Village (Seed: -7783854906403730143)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Okay, we’re back to the water again. But I couldn’t leave this seed out because not only do you have a cozy seaside village to enjoy, but there are shipwrecks, a ruined portal, and large mountains to explore after your base is set up. This seed is great for a bit of adventure and still a great home to go back to when you’re finished.</p>
 </div> <div data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-3-desert-village-seed-4818056236209846150" data-injectable="false">3. Desert Village (Seed: 4818056236209846150)</h2> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">For a change from the views on the water, this seed’s village is located opposite the ocean in a vast desert. In fact, there are actually multiple villages you can find in the desert here, but that’s not all. There are also multiple desert temples for you to explore in this seed, so you get the best of both worlds with a lovely place to build a home and plenty of adventure to find.</p> </div> <div data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-2-coastal-peninsula-village-seed-2083747154327962073" data-injectable="false">2. Coastal Peninsula Village (Seed: 2083747154327962073)</h2> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="true">On a breathtaking cliff overhanging the water, you can find this stunning coastal village in this seed. There are lovely caves you’re able to build your own base in, or you can join the village itself and build a cozy home on the seaside. This massive peninsula gives you plenty of room to work with, whether you need room for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-tame-a-fox-in-minecraft/">tame foxes</a> or pet cats.</p>
 </div> <div data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-1-cliff-village-seed-6537256334104833826-t" data-injectable="false">1. Cliff Village (Seed: -6537256334104833826)T</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">If you’re looking for a village that’s not like the others, then this seed is for you. The village in this seed is built on a massive cliff on the water, making it an interesting challenge just to reach everything. This village gives you everything you need, including resources, plenty of villagers, houses, and fantastic views. There’s even farmland nestled into the side of the cliff for you to use.</p>
