			<p>New early Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 comparison videos were shared online over the weekend, highlighting how the upcoming new version of the game holds up surprisingly well compared to other versions.</p>
<p>The new comparison videos, which were put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BluntyTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blunty</a>, compare the latest high-quality footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version which was shared by developer CD Projekt Red itself after providing it for a round of<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-footage-underestimated/"> Japanese previews</a>, featuring the same sequences seen in the footage recreated on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and on an ROG Ally that simulates the Steam Deck specs. While the new version of the game clearly loses to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions in terms of graphics and performance, it holds up extremely well to them, considering we are talking about handheld hardware. In the comparison with the simulated Steam Deck specs, the Nintendo Switch 2 version fares better, although that is to be expected, considering the game is presumably running in docked mode in the footage, so handheld mode footage will be needed for a proper comparison, which may not be made available in high-quality before launch.</p>

<p>Despite being available for five years now, Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 has quickly become one of the most anticipated launch games for the system. It will likely set a pretty high bar in terms of multiplatform ports on it. CD Projekt Red has put <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">incredible care</a> into this new version of the game, not wanting a repeat of the launch fiasco on previous generation consoles, and it definitely shows.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most of the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/669500/razer-blade-14-gaming-laptop-rtx-5060-5070-specs-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is making its Blade 14 thinner and more powerful, just like it did recently with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">16-inch counterpart</a>. In addition to giving it an RTX 5060 GPU with a <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-14" rel="sponsored">starting price of $2,299.99</a>, the Blade 14 can be specced out with the RTX 5070 for $2,699.99. Razer says it isn’t limiting that 5070 in this thin chassis, as it can deliver its maximum TGP of 115W.</p><p>Both the 5060 and 5070 versions of the Blade 14 are expected to launch in May, and Razer is also introducing a lower-cost Blade 16 with the RTX 5060 for $2,399.99 — due out this month as well.</p><p>The Blade 14 will have an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU and a 14-inch 3K 120Hz OLED display in all configurations, as well as per-key RGB lighting with customizable Razer Chroma compatibility. It can be configured with up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Sadly, the RAM is soldered in, but the single NVMe SSD slot is user-accessible if you want to put in a larger drive. The ports are mostly the same as last gen, with two USB4, two USB 3.2 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, reversible proprietary power plug, and 3.5mm combo audio jack, but it adds a UHS-II microSD slot.</p><p>What’s also changed for the 2025 Blade 14 is that it’s 11 percent thinner and 11 percent lighter than its predecessor. That translates to a laptop that’s 0.62 to 0.64 inches (15.7 mm to around 16.2 mm) thick from its thinnest to thickest points, and it weighs 3.59 pounds / 1.63 kg. Razer says it was able to make the Blade 14 thinner without sacrificing power or battery life (it’s still got a 72Whr cell) by redesigning its thermal shelf and cooling design — just like it did the Blade 16.</p><p>The Blade 14 looks a lot like a slightly shrunken-down Blade 16, following its bigger sibling’s redesign to a T. Well, mostly, as its microSD slot feels like a slight downgrade compared to the 16’s full-size SD. But even microSD is better than no slot at all. One differentiator of the Blade 14 is that it will be available in white as well as Razer’s typical matte black.</p><div><p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">my recent time testing the Blade 16</a>. It’s unsurprising that the Blade 14 is copy-pasting many of the same changes to be an even more portable hybrid gaming / content-creation machine, and remaining a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">noteworthy competitor to Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Tell it to the judge</h2>
<p>In an attempt to force Apple's hand, Epic <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-16-25-epic-games-filing-16f7f43cb85d.pdf">filed a motion</a> on Friday arguing that Apple's latest <em>Fortnite</em> denial is "blatant retaliation" for Epic's court challenge and an attempt to "circumvent this Court's Injunctions and this Court's authority."</p>
<p>Epic says the iOS version of <em>Fortnite</em> it recently submitted complies with all Apple policies and court rulings by offering a link to the external Epic Games Store for purchases. Through that link, players would be able to take advantage of a 20 percent discount on purchases compared to in-app purchases through iOS itself.</p>
<p>"Although Apple’s contracts may permit it to reject an app for lawful reasons, the Injunction provides that Apple may no longer reject an app—including <em>Fortnite</em>—because its developer chooses to include an external purchase link," Epic wrote. "Likewise, if the Injunction is to have any teeth, Apple cannot reject an app on the ground that its developer has sought to enforce the Injunction’s prohibitions."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the filing, Epic says it is being "punished" by Apple after a nearly five-year legal battle and is being denied the ability to "take advantage of the pro-competitive rules it helped usher in." Epic argues that Apple "cannot reject any developer (including Epic) because they went to court to enforce the Injunction" and "cannot refuse to deal with Epic as retaliation for Epic’s decision to avail itself of this Court’s Injunction."</p>
<p>The matter will now be taken up by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who has shown little love for Apple in recent weeks. In her April order, she took the company to task for its "clear and convincing violation" of her initial injunction and even made a criminal contempt referral for Apple executives who she said "outright lied under oath."</p>
<p>"Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated," Gonzalez Rogers wrote at the time. "This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The next major collaboration coming to Overwatch was teased last week, as Capcom's Street Fighter franchise will become the first-ever video game franchise to join Blizzard's hero shooter. Eight of Overwatch's heroes will be given the Street Fighter treatment, as they'll be able to dress up as eight of SF's world warriors, with some new themed emotes to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with Overwatch art director Dion Rogers and former character art director Arnold Tsang to talk about bringing Street Fighter to Overwatch, from the character-selection process to how Street Fighter inspired some of Overwatch's design choices from the very beginning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="11520" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497281"></a><figcaption>The eight Overwatch 2 X Street Fighter skins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Match made in heaven"</h2><p dir="ltr">From the beginning of discussions–"about a year ago," according to Rogers--the Overwatch x Street Fighter collaboration has been what Tsang describes as "a match made in heaven." A big part of that, as Rogers describes, is Capcom's shared background in developing games.</p><p dir="ltr">"With some of our collaborations, there's a little bit more explaining to do," Rogers says. "Capcom though, they do this. They make games. They get it. If we come to them and say, 'Hey, there's some technical challenges with this, we're going to have to edit this look,' they understand. The back-and-forth between us and Capcom was really nice."</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom also gave the Overwatch team "complete say" in which heroes would be included from the Overwatch side, as well as the Street Fighter characters they would be paired with. There was only one caveat: The Street Fighter characters had to come from the roster of the current game, Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr">"We had complete say on what that would look like," Rogers says. "Capcom gave some suggestions after reviewing things with us, but we have a ton of Street Fighter fans on the team, so the concept artists already had ideas. Ultimately, we had a conversation together that landed on which hero we choose as the right hero for a character."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Finding the right pair</h2><p dir="ltr">The team at Overwatch, with Capcom's input, eventually settled on eight Overwatch heroes and the Street Fighter characters they'd be portraying:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hanzo as Ryu</li><li dir="ltr">Sigma as M. Bison</li><li dir="ltr">Winston as Blanka</li><li dir="ltr">Cammy as Widowmaker</li><li dir="ltr">Soldier: 76 as Guile</li><li dir="ltr">Zenyatta as Dhalsim</li><li dir="ltr">Juno as Chun-Li</li><li dir="ltr">Kimiko as Juri</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Some of these decisions allowed the team to explore new facets of a hero; pairing Widowmaker with Cammy, a natural fit given their assassin or "femme fatale" background, also offered a unique opportunity to show Widowmaker with a more human-like skin color as opposed to her trademark purple.</p><p dir="ltr">Other groups presented unique challenges; making Sigma into M. Bison, for example, resulted in Sigma donning a cape, which is not usually part of his outfit. "It doesn't affect gameplay too much," Rogers said. "Usually the animations and the movement of the hero kind of dictate who they are, but Bison now becomes a unique skin for Sigma because of the cape; no other Sigma skin has that."</p><p dir="ltr">The best parts of designing the skins, however, were when the animators could inject parts of the Street Fighter character's background into unexpected places. Hanzo as Ryu might seem like it poses a challenge--Ryu is no archer, after all--but the team immediately paired the two as the design process was evolving.</p><p dir="ltr">"Everything else [with the pair] fits perfectly, but the fact that Hanzo's an archer? We thought, 'Well, everyone else has guns,'" Arnold Tsang said. "If Ryu was going to be in Overwatch, he'd probably pick up the bow in favor of something else."</p><p dir="ltr">The Hanzo pairing also let Tsang add that unexpected reference too--"In Street Fighter, Ryu has that white bag he usually travels with," Tsang explains.

"I learned how to draw by studying the Street Fighter and Capcom artists," Tsang explains.</p><p dir="ltr">He attributes this to why, from a visual perspective, the two sides meshed so well together. "I remember in the beginning, when we were making the game, we had our first few heroes, and one of the big decisions we made was we wanted heroes from different countries," Tsang says."That was hugely inspired by Street Fighter; I used to have a poster where I would see the different characters and the little flag beside their names. So, when we made Overwatch, I thought 'Let's bring some of that energy into the game and have all these characters from different countries, influenced by their culture.' Some of that DNA is there, in these heroes from all around the world coming together."</p><p dir="ltr">Now that Street Fighter is entering Overwatch, what if the roles were reversed and a hero for Overwatch joined the battle in Street Fighter? Tsang has a few ideas on who might best fit on the Street Fighter roster from the Overwatch squad.</p><p dir="ltr">"Genji and Doomfist are melee characters, so those are no-brainers," Tsang says. "A lot of the heroes have guns, so it's harder to imagine how they'd fit into a traditional fighting game, as it makes the martial arts aspect less creative. Hanzo has a bow, but he also has the sword; he could use that too." Eventually, Tsang settles on one of the first names he mentioned: Doomfist, who according to Tsang, was "designed to be a fighting game character, basically."</p><p dir="ltr">The Overwatch x Street Fighter collaboration begins May 20 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

		<p>Outside of a pair of ventures into the far-flung future, the Anno series has always set its city-building ventures in the times of the Renaissance, early colonialism and through to the Industrial Revolution. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> rips us all the way back to the heights of the Roman Empire – literally, 117 AD was the Roman Empire at its greatest – and a period of relative peace to allow your budding settlements to flourish without <i>too</i> much worry of war breaking out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana Preview – Pleasing Plebians &amp; Trading Triremes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xOhonMdJCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game lets you play in two domains, either within the Roman Empire in Latium or in the less tamed Albion, and it was the former of these that we got to go hands-on with. Settling on a pleasant island, you get to work setting down a villa for your governor to call his home, laying down roads and connections between that, a port, and the first industry and living spaces for your citizens.</p>


<p>This is actually my first real experience of the Anno franchise, and I’m pleased to say that the game really sits under your fingers and thumbs quite nicely. Laying roads and buildings snaps neatly to a grid, and there’s just the right amount of freedom here in letting you shift to 45º angles for some pleasing variety in laying out your city –&nbsp;albeit accepting that buildings won’t pop up to fill off-angle spaces for you.</p>
<p>Anno 117 absolutely nails the look and feel of this as well, from the basic residences that you place through to the huge fields of wheat, hemp and other crops that would make Russell Crowe break down in tears – now that I think about it, that scene was about something else…</p>


<p>There’s a holistic cycle of building blocks of housing for new residents, unlocking new building types and industries to meet their wants and desires, and then being able to upgrade those domiciles to suit higher-class citizens who supply workers to new buildings and have a new set of needs. This is not a game for those of you who are opposed to gentrification!</p>
<p>It’s quite straightforward stuff in the opening hours. With the Libertus residents, you need to start fishing for sardines and farming for oats to supply a porridge kitchen to meet their food needs – this a simple two-step production line that just requires that the buildings are within range of one another, and of a warehouse for any storage overflow. With their tummies full, a marketplace and a tavern are unlocked, before catering to clothing with simple hemp tunics and woollen hats.</p>
<p>It’s once the Plebians arrive in upgraded homes that things start to get a shade more demanding. Baking requires wheat, salt water and a bakery, and I soon found industries that I couldn’t cater to simply from the natural qualities of the island. Without ground that’s suitable for olives, I can’t make olive oil, and with the noise and stench of pig farming to supply a tannery, making sandals has a negative impact on people’s happiness if everything’s clustered together. And then once you need to start making charcoal, the risks of fire grow, so you need to have firefighting and other public services ready and waiting to tackle any sudden challenges.</p>

<p>It won’t take too long, then, before you’re having to look beyond your starting island for ways to progress. Having arrived on a Trireme, you can send this ship out to explore the world map, pushing back the fluffy white clouds that obscure the archipelago of other small islands, bumping into other settlements, like that of Governor Tarragon of Ithacus, and just random island-spanning villas, such as that of Diana Augusta. There’s also unsavoury slavers, people of different regions entirely, and the diplomacy will let you set out whether you have a friendly and cordial relationship, or an antagonistic one. Given the cartoonishly evil looks of the slaver, you can happily antagonise them, but you likely want to work with your neighbours to establish trade routes, and Diana’s island provides missions that you can take on, some early narrative as you and some of your citizens look to attend her party.</p>
<p>One element that I really didn’t engage with was the warfare that is possible here. You can build up a military garrison and fence off your settlement, and while you’re on the high seas, some missions can have you run into hostile ships. Similarly, I barely got to scratch the surface of the research tree – some of which will tie across to managing a settlement in Albion, it seems – and the broad strokes of diplomacy and trade.</p>

<p>One thing that really stands out about Anno 117, though, is just how good it looks. The landscapes are lush and verdant, there’s a lot of fine detail to all of the buildings, and zooming in lets you appreciate the hustle and bustle as people wander around. I really enjoyed, as well, that this island I started on actually had ruins from a previous settlement off on the other side, giving a little sense of the centuries that the Roman Empire had already existed for prior to the Pax Romana period. Wrapped around this is the optional day-night cycle. You can lock the game at a particular time of day if you wish, but you miss out on the gorgeous sunsets and daybreaks, albeit with nighttime making it a little trickier to get building and management done – you’re always just a toggle click away from daylight, though.</p>
<p>From the opening hours I played, Anno 117: Pax Romana is shaping up as a lovely take on the city building genre, and an exciting step back into ancient history for fans of the series.</p>

While other action stars use camera tricks, stunt doubles and CGI to manufacture a sense of toughness, Cruise really is climbing the tallest building in the world, fighting on a moving train, and doing things in the air with planes that would get the average person put in jail or a grave.</p><p><em>Mission: Impossible</em> has been the standard-setter for action stunts for more than two decades, and that’s why we had to rank the wildest sequences that have been featured in the film. We’re judging these insane feats by how humanly improbable they are to pull off, so while some may look crazier than others on film, the ones that really pushed Cruise to his physical limits will rank the highest.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-8-dead-final-reckoning-trailer-date-1851694777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-8-dead-final-reckoning-trailer-date-1851694777"><em>The Final Reckoning</em></a></span><em> </em>will undoubtedly be another explosive entry into the <em>Mission: Impossible </em>canon, even if it’s its last. But don’t worry about not seeing Cruise putting his body on the line for an action flick: He’s already committed to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tom-cruise-making-movies-into-100s-mission-impossible-1236220928/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tom-cruise-making-movies-into-100s-mission-impossible-1236220928/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doing action films when he’s 100</a></span>. While we wait for Cruise’s geriatric leaps of faith in the future, lets revisit the stunts that made him one of the greatest action stars of all time.</p></div></div><div><p>It’s sacrilege to have any list involving <em>Mission: Impossible </em>stunts and not include the stunt that started it all. It might not be the wildest or most dangerous move Ethan Hunt’s pulled off, but the ceiling drop in <em>Mission: Impossible</em> is, without question, the most iconic. It’s the stillness that makes it unforgettable. A droplet of sweat could’ve got him arrested. A sneeze almost blew the entire mission. This was the last of its kind before the franchise traded in grounded, semi-practical stunts for the over-the-top theatrics that made it the benchmark of action films. </p></div><div><p>There are no gadgets. There is no mission. There’s just Ethan Hunt free-climbing on crumbling desert rocks, thousands of feet above sea level...for fun. That was what the spy considered a vacation. We even see Cruise wedge his knees into a crevice, then terrifyingly lean back to rest his body and re-chalk his hands. While the sequence where Hunt slips was performed by a stunt double, Cruise was genuinely climbing these walls himself—albeit with safety ropes that were painted out in post. But, it’s still one of the best parts of one of the worst <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movies ever.</p></div><div><p>It’s hard enough performing realistic fighting sequences on motorcycles, or dangling from the stage lighting at the opera, but, imagine doing it on the top of a speeding train while dodging low-hanging signs, leaping between cars, and barely clinging on as the train threatens to toss you into oblivion at every turn. Cruise sells every slip, stumble, and surge of momentum with zero green screen in sight. What makes it truly insane isn’t just the risk—it’s how he’s able to have the type of hand-to-hand combat that’s become standard in <em>Mission: Impossible</em> while doing the stunt. And he really is doing it. Both actors were up on the especially built train, moving at 60mph, each of the numerous moments of shock reminding you of what the stakes really are for this stunt. </p></div><div><p>We’re fully aware that Cruise’s motorcycle cliff jump in <em>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One </em>has been called the biggest stunt in movie history. It is also one of the few stunts so daring that even Ethan Hunt had to pause for a second to realize exactly what he was about to do. The silence when he leaps off the bike mirrors the air being sucked back into your lungs in shock as you watch. The gigantic scenery making Cruise a small dot surrounded by potential danger is sublime. It’s still not the most ridiculous <em>Mission: Impossible </em>stunt ever, simply because it boils down to him riding off a cliff into a freefall before pulling his parachute, but the danger Cruise put himself in, and the spectacular photography of the moment, make it one of the most memorable movie stunts of all time.</p></div><div><p> The average human can hold their breath underwater for 90 seconds, and is likely to pass out if unable to breathe for longer than two minutes. For the untrained person, brain cells will begin to die after five minutes without oxygen. Cruise was underwater for six minutes filming the pivotal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244"><em>Rogue Nation </em>scene</a></span> where Ethan Hunt has to infiltrate a water-filled chamber to switch out the security key card disks. Avoiding flailing mechanical arms, then having the key cards knocked out of his hand and having to retrieve them, is tough to watch.</p><p> With significant training, and by slowing their heartrates, some people can hold their breath for as long as 25 minutes. Cruise’s six minutes remains an extraordinary feat, especially given he’s performing stunts at the same time, and at the time it was the longest any actor had held their breath for a scene—a record since broken by Kate Winslet while filming the <em>Avatar </em>sequel, where she was underwater for seven minutes and 14 seconds.</p></div><div><p>This may be the longest the audience ever spends with Hunt freefalling in the sky, and that makes it terrifyingly good. The shot of him falling out of the sky and finding the incapacitated body of August Walker (Henry Cavill) perfectly aligned with the sunlit horizon is both beautiful and visual reminder of just how high  he is. And he still had to have the frame of mind to deliver emotive acting, while perfectly timing his fall to catch the falling body. On the right day, you could convince me this is higher on the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> ranking.</p></div><div><p>Within four minutes of <em>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation</em> starting, Ethan Hunt was hanging onto the side of an airborne plane while  gravity tries to rip the skin off his face. The best <em>Mission: Impossible </em>stunts usually elicit the same reactions: What?! Why? Seriously?! Before we get into how ridiculously insane this stunt is, what really endeared it to me was how I just assumed Cruise’s reckless mentality was about to be on display. This is the fifth film in the <em>Mission: Impossible </em>franchise, so we’ve already seen him dangle from a ceiling vent in Langley, climb Dead Horse Point, and scale the tallest building in the world, all because the mission called for it. So, as soon as he asked Benji if he could open the door on a moving plane, I didn’t just know he was going to climb that plane, I <em>wanted</em> him to.</p><p>Now, as far as ludicrous stunts go, this one is hard to top (but we will!). The man was 5,000 feet in the air, holding onto nothing but a plane door with his legs dangling. The continuous shot of the plane getting higher, with no camera cuts, is spectacular and deeply uncomfortable. And that always makes for an all-time stunt. The fact he did this stunt <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afS5ks54tms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afS5ks54tms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EIGHT times</a></span> makes it even wilder.</p></div><div><p>At 2,717 feet, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest building in the world. Ethan needed to climb from the 130th floor to the 134th, in order to break into the server room. Did he have an industrial grade pulley system, or a harness, or a Marvel-like superpowers allowing him to shoot up to the level? No, all he had was malfunctioning adhesive climbing gloves and the same upper body strength that allowed him to climb Dead Horse Point in <em>Mission: Impossible II</em>, just now in an older body.</p><p>The overhead shots of Cruise gingerly climbing the picturesque glass window with nothing but an 1,800 feet drop below him is enough to suffocate anyone watching with anxiety. You <em>knew</em> he was not going to die because you saw Cruise do interviews for the movie. But, the stunt it so death-defying that for a split second, when he’s dangling from one arm because one of his gloves short-circuited, you believed this was the last time you’d ever see this daredevil again. Oh, and the man also ran across the glass windows and swung from one floor to the next. </p><p>All of that, and it wasn’t even the climax of the movie. But, it surely is the most memorable part. </p></div><div><p>Let’s take a quick second to understand exactly what Thomas Cruise Mapother IV signed on to do. As Ethan Hunt, the adrenaline addict agreed to fly a helicopter while swerving around mountains, doing a 360-degree downward spiral, getting dangerously close to crashing, escaping death by pulling the helicopter up at the right moment. This was all while Ethan is supposed to be in pursuit of genocidal turncoat agent August Walker, trying to stop him from using one of the two nuclear detonators needed to set off two plutonium bombs and poison the water supply of a third of the world’s population. </p><p>That alone would have it high on these rankings. It becomes the unquestionably wildest <em>Mission: Impossible </em>stunt when you remember this: before Cruise even gets into the helicopter he’s dangling from onto the landing skids below. He also hangs onto the rope connected to the a large payload, onto which he falls 40-foot backwards. This man did a blind fall off of a fucking helicopter attached to nothing more than a safety line that was only there so, “if Tom was killed during the stunt, we wouldn’t be looking for his body in the bushes,” according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mission-impossible-fallout-stunt-breakdown-20180728-story.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mission-impossible-fallout-stunt-breakdown-20180728-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fallout </em>director Christopher McQuarrie</a></span>.</p><p>Tom, if you’re reading this, thank you for being an absolute lunatic so we can all have 10 minutes of thrilling action. Also, thank you for not dying. That would’ve sucked.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft has rolled out a new Xbox update allows players to further customize the home screen, and the changes sound pretty nice. For now, the new features are available only to Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha users, before everyone else gets to try it later. You can <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for the free Xbox Insider program</a> to get early access to Xbox updates.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/16/xbox-insiders-get-new-ways-to-personalize-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's received feedback from fans that they want the Home screen on Xbox to feel more personalized. Specifically, fans have asked for Microsoft to hide tiles they don't regularly use, and in general, make the Home screen feel "less crowded." This new update is an attempt to give fans some updates with those concerns in mind, Microsoft said.</p><p>"This update is part of our ongoing effort to make Home more personal, flexible, and responsive to your feedback," the company explained.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497269" data-ratio="0.54969749351772" data-width="1157" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497269"></a><figcaption>You can now further customize the Xbox Home screen.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png"></figure><p>So what's in the new update? To begin with, the Home screen now has three new settings, the first of which is "Hide System Apps." Whereas system apps would previously show up under "recently played games," this will no longer happen. The second new setting is "Pin Favorites to Home," and this allows users to pin up to three recently played games or apps to the recently played list. "These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles," Microsoft said.</p><p>The third is "Reduce Tile Count." This isn't available yet, but when it does arrive, users will be able to reduce the number of tiles that show up in the recently played games and apps list. "We're still refining this setting, and it will be coming soon," Microsoft said.</p><p>In other news, Microsoft just recently raised Xbox console prices, while the company will start <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">charging $80 for games later this year.</a> The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase</a> is coming June 8, with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a> broadcast to follow immediately after.</p>

                <p>Summer is typically a great time to head outside, enjoy the warmer weather, and work on your tan, but if you're into video games, it's also a season of announcements. Similar to previous years, various developers and publishers are gearing up to reveal what they're working on, as they'll be taking to the internet for a series of livestreams. From indie games to upcoming AAA releases, the next couple of months are going to be a busy--but entertaining--time in the industry.</p><p>If you're looking to stay up to date on when these livestreams are being held, we'll be keeping track of everything and updating this post whenever a new livestream is announced. For now, there's a lot to look forward to already as Geoff Keighley's annual Summer Game Fest, the feel-good Wholesome Direct, and the Xbox Games Showcase are all confirmed for this year. A few other events are also coming even sooner--a clever move that will allow these respective initiatives more time to shine.</p><p>Here's a closer look at everything on the way.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#May_22">May 22</a><ul><li><a href="#Warhammer_Skulls">Warhammer Skulls</a></li><li><a href="#Six_One_Indie_Showcase">Six One Indie Showcase</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#May_29">May 29</a><ul><li><a href="#Indie_Quest">Indie Quest</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_6">June 6</a><ul><li><a href="#Access_Ability_Summer_Showcase">Access-Ability Summer Showcase</a></li><li><a href="#Summer_Game_Fest">Summer Game Fest</a></li><li><a href="#Day_of_the_Devs">Day of the Devs</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_7">June 7</a><ul><li><a href="#Wholesome_Direct">Wholesome Direct</a></li><li><a href="#Future_Games_Show">Future Games Show</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_8">June 8</a><ul><li><a href="#Xbox_Games_Showcase">Xbox Games Showcase</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_Direct">The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a></li><li><a href="#PC_Gaming_Show">PC Gaming Show</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="May_22">May 22</h2><h3 id="Warhammer_Skulls">Warhammer Skulls</h3><p><strong>Where to watch</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/warhammer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@officialwarhammer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li></ul><p><strong>When to watch</strong></p><ul><li><strong>PT: </strong>9 AM</li><li><strong>ET: </strong>12 PM</li><li><strong>BST: </strong>5 PM</li></ul><p>For all things grimdark in video games, the Warhammer Skulls livestream is the place to be.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s forthcoming espionage game Physint won't be released for quite a few years yet.</p>
<p>Kojima's next game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, is on the cusp of release, but Physint is already in development alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD</a>.</p>
<p>He even wants to create a film as well, but these game projects are a priority first. "Besides Death Stranding 2, there's Physint in development," Kojima told French magazine Le Film Français (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-says-in-an-interview-with-a-french-magazine-that-the-death-stranding-movie-is-planned-for-2027-and-that-physint-will-take-him-5-or-6-years.1192278/">ResetEra</a>). "It'll take me another five or six years. But maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film."</p>

<p>He continued: "I grew up with cinema. Directing it would be a kind of homage to it. Besides, I'm getting older, and I'd prefer to do it while I'm still young."</p>
<p>Kojima is now 61 years of age, meaning Physint won't be released until he's into his late 60s and, at this rate, a film won't be likely until he's in his 70s.</p>
<p>And with a few years to go until Physint, does that mean it could release on Sony's next console? Back in 2022, a confidential document suggested the company wouldn't expect a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-doesnt-expect-playstation-6-before-2027-confidential-document-suggests">PlayStation 6 until at least 2027</a>. Of course, that may have changed to even later now.</p>
<p>Kojima first announced Physint in 2024, describing it as "the third, new original IP since the establishment of Kojima Productions" and a "completely new 'Action Espionage' for the next-generation". Many fans are expecting it to rival Metal Gear, the series Kojima is most known for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">Death Stranding 2 certainly has more than a shade of Metal Gear to it</a>, both in its expanded combat options and its story themes.</p>
<p>At a recent preview for Death Stranding 2, Kojima mentioned the desire from fans for a new Metal Gear game inspired Physint.</p>
<p>"Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create," he said. "But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That's when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected, and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint."</p>
<p>Still, he told Edge Magazine he's not "interested in appealing to the mass market", after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">test reviews for Death Stranding 2 came out positively</a>.</p>
<p>"Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish it was a bit more controversial," said Kojima. "Blockbuster films need an 80 percent approval rating - I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market, or selling millions of copies. That's not what I'm aiming for."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bethesda-shows-even-more-support-to-the-skyblivion-mod-team-hosts-them-at-rockville-headquarters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda showed even more support to the Skyblivion mod team, and invited them to tour Bethesda Studios headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. The Skyblivion team shared the excursion with <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1923793664112726161">a post on X</a>, with photos from the studio and with developers from Bethesda, including Todd Howard, thanking the studio for having them and showing them around.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you to our friends Bethesda Studios for having us over and showing us around!</em>" the post reads. "<em>Meeting the legendary people behind some of our favorite games was incredible and was only matched by their shared enthusiasm for Skyblivion and the modding community</em>."</p>
<p>It's the latest show of support after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">Bethesda gifted the entire Skyblivion team game keys</a> for the recently released Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>If you weren't aware, Skyblivion is a total conversion mod effort to take The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and recreate it in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It's been in development for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/">more than eight years</a>, and is finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">due to release sometime in 202</a>5, though it'll just be the base Oblivion game on launch, with the Oblivion DLCs due to come sometime later.</p>
<p>When the Oblivion Remaster was first spotted online, ahead of it being officially revealed, Wccftech reached out to the Skyblivion team, who had no ill-will towards the work that Bethesda was doing in its own remastering of Oblivion.</p>
<p>"<em>For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster,</em>" said the Skyblivion team lead Rebelzize.</p>
<p>"<em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different from what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing [Skyblivion] was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all.</em>"</p>

Melee </em>Major tournament when both got caught in the fire forest phase of Pokémon Stadium. With both players separated by one of the obstacles, they twitched back and forth, biding their time to see who would make the first move. It ended up being Pratt, though perhaps not in the way he intended. A rare glitch saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/mang0/clip/DoubtfulBoringMushroomWOOP-EOx2mIS8XoYHgZ-R&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mang0/clip/DoubtfulBoringMushroomWOOP-EOx2mIS8XoYHgZ-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">him accidentally fall straight through the level</a></span>, cementing Schwab’s victory and the $2,000 first place prize. </p><p>The glitch is triggered by wavedashing, a physics exploit common in high-level <em>Melee</em> that lets players maneuver quickly without leaving them vulnerable. Doing so around the tree in the fire forest phase of the Pokémon Stadium stage, however, opens players up to an uncommon but well-known glitch that will send them falling through the level geometry. Guest commentator Juan “Hungrybox” Debiedma, who lost to Pratt earlier in the tournament, even mentioned the possibility on air, just moments before it unfolded on-screen.</p><p>“There’s just no way LMAO,” Pratt <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/moky_dokie/status/1924255114040402380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/moky_dokie/status/1924255114040402380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span> after the match. Not everyone is convinced it was an accident, however. How could a player as skilled and experienced as Pratt succumb to such a one-in-a-million bug? Did he lose that way on purpose because it would be funny, or to prove a point about why certain levels should be banned? Then again, is a briefly viral Twitch clip really worth $2,000? In this economy?</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soul-sacrifice-review/1900-6407884/">Soul Sacrifice</a> launched in 2013 for PS Vita and came from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keiji-inafunes-soul-sacrifice-headed-to-us/1100-6379783/">a concept created by former Mega Man designer Keiji Inafune</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/freedom-wars-review/1900-6415969/">Freedom Wars</a> arrived the following year in 2014 for the handheld. Both Vita exclusives <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-sacrifice-monster-hunter-in-different-clothing/1100-6396876/">featured Monster Hunter-like similarities</a>, which is notable because Capcom's popular franchise skipped the Sony handheld after being a juggernaut on PlayStation Portable. Nintendo was able to secure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-headed-to-3ds-in-early-2015/1100-6417343/">Monster Hunter 4 as an exclusive for 3DS</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The online <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vita-exclusives-freedom-wars-soul-sacrifices-servers-shut-down-next-month/1100-6498377/">servers for Soul Sacrifice and Freedom Wars were shut down</a> in 2021. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-vita-exclusives-is-getting-remastered/1100-6526546/">Freedom Wars Remastered launched</a> earlier this year, providing a new way to play the game on PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>As for Yoshida, he's been showing up on other podcasts recently, too. For instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-80-games-are-a-steal-based-on-what-they-offer-former-playstation-exec-says/1100-6531628/">Yoshida stated that certain $80 games could be a steal</a> because of the hours of entertainment they provide.</p>

So they over-invested and over-hired and they started too many projects, but after COVID there were a lot more ways for people to entertain themselves so the growth slowed down."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yoshida described the situation that has left thousands of developers out of work (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-reevaluating-playstation-studios-and-cutting-900-jobs">including many at his former employer Sony</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) as "very sad," but claimed the "stupid money" that helped spark that age of over-investment&nbsp;has departed the video game industry in search of the next big thing.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-is-delisting-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-after-one-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">Activision is delisting Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile after one year</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yoshida feels diverse portfolios and smaller projects can deliver stability">Yoshida feels diverse portfolios and smaller projects can deliver stability</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does that mean there's cause for quiet optimism? Yoshida believes so, but feels the largest companies need to begin (sensibly) investing in portfolio rather than pinning all of their financial hopes on a handful of gargantuan projects with no margin for error.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Each product is different, right? Some live service games are successful—like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Helldivers 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So you cannot just take one product [or model] and say they're all wrong. Especially with entertainment products, nobody can predict sales, especially when new IPs are tried," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've worked with marketers in the past and they always miss the numbers. So, what big companies should do is invest in a portfolio of titles—because if they just invest in a small number of titles it's a huge risk. Even when you invest in existing successful franchises, because people's tastes will change."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also important, says Yoshida, to moderate the amount invested across that portfolio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains that because big companies have to compete with rivals of similar size and stature, budgets can quickly balloon as competitors attempt to outdo each other. The antidote to that budgetary arms race, he suggests, is to realize that "sometimes limitation is really helpful" for studios and developers looking to push themselves creatively.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-projects-annual-growth-despite-gta-vi-delay" target="_self" data-discover="true">Take-Two projects annual growth despite GTA VI delay</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a sentiment that chimes with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential">advice handed out by </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential">Astro Bot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential"> director Nicolas Doucet at GDC 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where he reminded attendees that "it's okay to make a small game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of the choices we made with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be labelled double-A or maybe lacking in ambition—like the size of the team, the size of the game, the fact there's no text, no voice, and its not an open world," added Doucet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has delisted&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>from both major mobile storefronts, so if you want to play a round of the battle royale FPS, you'd better hope you've already got it installed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on Friday</a>, Activision said that while it's proud of its "accomplishment" in creating an "authentic" mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, the mobile edition of the game hasn't "met [Activision's] expectations" in the same way as the PC and console versions have.</p>

<p>As such, new gameplay updates and seasonal events will no longer be added to&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile</em>, and you won't be able to buy in-game points or the BlackCell battle pass using real currency either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted-stadium.jpg?itok=TQP886zh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted-stadium.jpg?itok=5Cr1jzqK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>can no longer be downloaded from either major mobile storefront.</figcaption></figure><p>If you had&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>downloaded and installed prior to today, then you can still enjoy it now, provided that it's still on your system. However, if you didn't have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>installed on your device before today, then it's gone for good.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you can redownload it if you previously gave it a shot, either; you've got to have it on your device already, or your access to the game has been permanently revoked.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>on your phone or tablet, then you can continue to play it, and cross-progression will still be available, as will servers complete with matchmaking for online play.</p>

<p>You can also continue to spend whatever COD Points you have left over on "available content in the Store"; you just can't purchase any more with your real currency.</p>




<p>For a limited time, if you sign up to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile&nbsp;</em>using your Activision account (and you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>player), you can nab yourself some&nbsp;<em>Mobile&nbsp;</em>COD Points by way of an incentive.</p>

<p>More info about this, as well as all other things pertaining to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>'s shutdown, can be found via Activision's official <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the matter.&nbsp;If you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone&nbsp;</em>player on PC or console, don't fret; that version of the game isn't going anywhere.</p>

Siege X launches alongside a new season called Operation Daybreak. It redesigns the Defender Operator named Clash, who can now deploy her shield and activate its taser remotely. Operation Daybreak also brings other balancing updates to the game, such as electricity slowing Operators rather than damaging them now, reducing limb damage, and adjusting the abilities of Blackbeard, Jackal, Jäger, Thunderbird, and Sledge. The developers also plan to be more efficient in making anti-cheat updates throughout the season.</p><p>When Season 3 arrives several months from now, it will introduce a new Operator to the game, who is from Switzerland and wields a new weapon. It will also remaster the Nighthaven, Lair, and Consulate maps, feature the return of a Halloween event, and bring some changes to Dual Front to set up the new Operator. Then, Rainbow Six Siege will celebrate its 10th anniversary during Season 4, so Ubisoft will have a special in-game event for it. More Operator and map remasters, updates to training mode, and a new playlist called Testing Grounds will also arrive in Season 4.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X and Operation Daybreak will launch on June 10 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A test server for Siege X will run between May 20 and June 9.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-plans-to-continue-making-games-in-some-way-even-after-he-has-passed-away/">Hideo Kojima</a> and Kojima Productions next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is due to release in a little more than a month. After that, it's anyone's guess as to when the next games we know Kojima has cooking, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-return-to-stealth-physint-spurred-by-brush-with-death/">Physint</a>, are going to hit store shelves.</p>
<p>Kojima's guess, at least regarding Physint, is that we won't see its release for another "<em>five or six years</em>." That's what he told French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/">Le Film Français</a> in a recent interview (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/">VGC</a>), when talking about his future projects, and aspirations to make movies, now that Death Stranding 2 is nearly out the door.</p>
<p>"<em>Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film. I grew up with cinema. Directing would be a kind of homage to it. Besides, I'm getting older, and I would prefer to do it while still young.</em>"</p>
<p>Kojima doesn't talk about OD, so perhaps OD is right in the middle of the five-to-six-year period, or it'll come afterward, with him working on OD alongside his first big film project. That's all just speculation, but unless we're due to hear that OD has been canceled, it arguably has to be somewhere in the next decade.</p>
<p>I mean, realistically, how much longer will Kojima keep working? He's currently 61, and if his estimation for Physint is correct, then he's technically also just confirmed the first cross-generational release between PS5 and PS6, unless, of course, the PS5 sticks around for more than a decade. And by that time, he'll be 67, looking to start directing movies, and maybe even still working on OD.</p>
<p>This all puts even more importance on Death Stranding 2. Whether you like Kojima's work or not, he's been one of the video game industry's most influential creators for years now. DS2 is officially one of the last game's we'll see from Hideo Kojima, and marks the closing of an era in video games with him officially looking at the exit door, even if he's not yet put a foot over the edge.</p>
