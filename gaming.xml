            <p>Corporate gaming giant NetEase are hunting for more jobs to slash among their overseas studios, according to insiders who spoke to Bloomberg and Game File last week. The parent company recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">cut a bunch of US jobs among their Marvels Rivals developers</a> despite the game raking in a big profit. And it now looks like that was just the start of a larger mauling which may hit up to 20 of the company's non-Chinese studios.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"NetEase is actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios—many of the very same ones it announced over the last three years," says Stephen Totilo in a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">report for Game File</a>. "One of Game File’s sources says NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams, leading to the potential closure of more than a dozen game studios, if they can’t secure new post-NetEase funding." </p>
<p>Among the overseas studios owned by NetEase are French studio Quantic Dream, who were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-have-acquired-quantic-dream">acquired in 2022</a>, and Nagoshi Studio, a venture set-up by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-yakuza-series-director-announces-new-studio-under-netease">a former Yakuza director</a>. The corporate behemoth also own several overseas studios that haven't released a game yet, such as US studio Bulletfarm and Bad Brain Game Studios in Canada, among 16 other studios in various countries. It's not clear which of these studios are on the chopping block. </p>
<p>"[All] studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation," the company told Game File after a request for comment, "and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process.” </p>
<p>NetEase are also partial owners of Polish studio Rebel Wolves, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-the-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-a-trailer-looks-witcherish">recently revealed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood Of Dawnwalker</a>. But they are minority shareholders, as clarified by co-owner Tomasz Tinc <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/">on LinkedIn</a>, who said that Dawnwalker is "fully funded" and not in danger.</p>
<p>"The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," he said.

</p><p>A pattern of cuts to relatively new NetEase studios has already emerged. As noted by Edwin recently, NetEase have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">pulled funding for Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">split with Jar Of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">laid people off</a> at Liquid Swords. All these studios were recently set up by industry veterans who had worked on game series' like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo">Halo</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>. </p>
<p>The move is a strategic set of cutbacks envisioned from on-high, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push">Bloomberg</a>, who report that NetEase CEO William Ding has "reasserted his leadership with a series of dramatic decisions over the past year", including hiring a number of 20-something finance graduates to "lead or supervise gaming units", according to the newspaper's sources. </p>
<p>NetEase laid off almost 900 workers from various games subsidiaries over the course of 2023, Bloomberg also notes. But when asked about the status of overseas studios on a conference call last week, Ding responded via translator to say that the company will continue to support "high-quality studios and really master creators.”</p>
<p>“That is our strategy,” he said. “There’s no change on that.”</p>
<p>If you are one of the 448,000 players who played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> at the height of its popularity on Steam, you may be looking at those recently laid off and wondering what counts to Ding as "high-quality". </p>

            <p>A former boss of Amazon Games has detailed why the company couldn't compete with Valve's Steam platform for PC sales.</p>
<p>Ethan Evans was VP of Prime Gaming at Amazon until September 2020, and in a recent post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAVvKbEB4BSwtr1FhSqcqk72HAWxOtwQlK0">LinkedIn</a> he detailed how Amazon "failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam".</p>
<p>"We were at least 250 times bigger, and we tried everything," he wrote. "But ultimately, Goliath lost."</p>

<p>Amazon tried three times to enter the "online-game-store market", said Evans. The first was by acquiring the small PC games store Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it, but this "went nowhere".</p>
<p>The second, after Amazon bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, was to create its own PC games store and utilise the Twitch audience for sales. "Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch," said Evans. "Wrong."</p>
<p>The third effort from Amazon was its Luna streaming service, which competed with Google's own ill-fated Stadia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stadia-is-shutting-down-in-january">shut down in January 2023</a>. Luna remains live, but Evans admitted neither Amazon nor Google's efforts "gained significant traction". "The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google)," he said.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam," said Evans. "It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well."</p>
<p>He continued: "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.</p>
<p>"We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either.</p>
<p>"Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it."</p>
<p>Amazon still has its Prime Gaming subscription, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-another-20-games-in-february-including-one-for-xbox">this month includes BioShock 2 Remastered and Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>And after publishing multiple MMORPGs, Amazon Games' next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">King of Meat from ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers</a>.</p>
<p>Steam, meanwhile, has just seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-lands-series-second-biggest-start-on-steam">concurrent player numbers peak once again</a> this month, hitting 39.92 million online users.</p>
<p>Steam's other big competitor, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic Games Store, also now has more players than ever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/moroi-could-be-one-of-the-weirdest-games-of-2025-and-it%E2%80%99s-all-the-better-for-it.1116966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/moroi-demo-preview-one-of-the-weirdest-games-of-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Moroi grabbed my attention when it was announced late in 2024 with its grimdark aesthetic and grotesque characters. Taking its name from a Romanian folk monster (apparently some kind of vampire) the top-down hack and slash action game looked like a spiritual successor to the excellent Van Helsing series. Having now got my grubby hands on a preview demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2518410/Moroi/">available now via Steam Next Fest</a> – and spent some time in a Q&amp;A with the developer, I am pleased to report that it is actually so much more than I expected.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moroi | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeXCOkKuZP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is a clear sense of mystery and deliberate confusion in the world of Moroi. You begin by waking up in a prison cell with no memory of who you are and how you got there. The door to your cell is open and you begin to explore your strange surroundings. During the roughly 30 minutes of the demo I encountered a cast of bizarre characters, some fun combat, and a series of enjoyable – if simple – puzzles.</p>


<p>The graphical style that first caught my attention looks great in the demo build. While the bulk of the demo takes place in a dark prison environment there is a good level of detail and excellent lighting to add to the atmosphere. The star of the show, though, is clearly the character designs. Your own player character looks like a mannequin of sorts (in a manner that begins to be revealed as the game progresses) but NPCs look uncannily similar to the nightmarish cenobites of Clive Barker’s Hellraiser series.</p>


<p>Brief conversations with early NPCs do little to unravel the mysterious nature of your plight, but odd characters such as a self-aware furnace are as quirky as they are unsettling. Perhaps the most important character in the early stages is a talking duck that gives you his teeth to upgrade your weapon and enable you to break through barriers. The fact that such a sentence rolls off in this preview is a testament to how strange the world of Moroi really is.</p>
<p>Puzzles here are mostly generally simple find the correct object affairs, but there are a couple which require you to read the various lore messages you find along the way. Combat is either melee or ranged with the chaingun you find – the latter showing the way that the developer is clearly aiming for fun rather than any kind of realism. The chaingun has no ammo counter but is on a cooldown so there is some strategy involved in either dodging around enemies or switching between weapons during fights. The playthrough I watched during the Q&amp;A presentation made the combat look particularly challenging, but on Normal it feels pitched quite well. Attacking enemies builds up a finisher meter that enables a one hit kill which also heals you so there is a good sense of rhythm to the combat.</p>

<p>About 20 minutes into the demo, your player character is seemingly killed and there is a drastic change in tone and scenery. The tonal whiplash from this moment is my abiding memory of my time with Moroi. It is clearly a game that isn’t afraid to take you in some weird and unexpected directions, reminding me in part of recent classics like Indika or the Zeno Clash series.</p>
<p>If the rest of the game comes close to the strangeness of this 30 minute demo then Moroi should be guaranteed to become a cult classic. With a release date of early 2025 we shouldn’t have too long to wait before checking out the full game.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5 adds complexity in some interesting ways that allow the development of games that may not have been possible before but at a cost on PC that will likely only get mitigated in the future by brute forcing better performance.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broke Silicon podcast, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk discussed Unreal Engine 5 at length, highlighting the many issues developers face with the engine but also how it adds complexity in ways that is allowing them to do things that maybe couldn't be done before, but with a base cost that was, at launch, two GPU generations behind in terms of performance, a really unsurprising statement considering we have seen, time and time again, how Unreal Engine 5-powered games don't seem to run well even on top-end hardware. On consoles, things are quite different, according to the developer, as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S have dedicated hardware, such as their IO controllers, that handle data compression and decompression. On PC, on the other hand, there are a lot of data bottlenecks that prevent the process from being smooth, and, as of now, it seems like performance will only get better with the faster interface and CPUs, essentially brute forcing through the issues, getting to the point where latency will be so low and the interface speed so fast that things will get better at least until the next generation of consoles. As such, it may be until the RTX 6000 series when Unreal Engine 5 will run as it should on PC.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5 creator Epic is well aware of the performance issues in games powered by their engine and has recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-shader-compilation-systems-prevent-stuttering-not-work-properly/"> outlined</a> what the engine features to mitigate the issues and what they are currently working on to further improve the situation. Some of these systems, however, don't seem to be working properly out-of-the-box, and require developer intervention, so there's definitely more work to be done until shader compilation and other performance issues become a thing of the past in UE5 games.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5. You can learn more about some of the features it introduces, including the Nanite of lights, MegaLights, by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Bossa Games, the London-based company behind indie hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> and I Am Bread, has announced a second wave of job losses - just a year after it previously shed a third of its staff.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/">statement posted to LinkedIn</a>, company co-founder Henrique Olifers said Bossa had been forced to make "the painful decision to scale back" its size once more.
</p>
<p>
The company will now focus all its efforts on getting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">open-world airship adventure Lost Skies</a> out the door, before "reshap[ing] into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many staff have been impacted by these latest layoffs, though Olifers wrote that the changes meant the studio would be "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time".
</p>
<p>
"We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back or teams," Olifers continued, "but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour."
</p>
<p>
The co-CEO blamed the action on a "fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams", though did not elaborate further how Bossa had been affected in particular.
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2024, Bossa was thought to employ around 60 people, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-studios-lets-go-a-third-of-its-staff">layoffs saw 19 jobs lost which Olifers blamed on a "perfect storm of events"</a> at the time: higher development costs, funding delays, and a tougher market for indie games.
</p>
<p>
It's been four years since Bossa last shipped a game - I Am Fish. It remains best known for Surgeon Simulator, which it launched in 2013 and followed up with various other versions for smartphones, Switch and VR.
</p>
<p>
Bossa had previously received funding from NetEase, the Chinese giant that is currently pulling back from many of its gaming studio investments across the globe. 
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tinybuild-acquires-bossa-studios-ips-for-3m">Bossa sold the rights to I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator</a> to US indie publisher TinyBuild, generating a reported $3m.

			<p>The official PC system requirements for Lost Soul Aside have been revealed, confirming the system configurations that can run the game at different quality settings and with ray tracing.</p>
<p>The system requirements for running the game without ray tracing look reasonable enough for a game launching this year, as players will need either an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU and either an RTX 3070 or RX 6800 XT to run the game at the high preset, although with an unknown target resolution and framerate. The requirements unsurprisingly become more demanding with ray tracing, as an RTX 5070 Ti GPU will be required for the Ultra Ray Tracing preset.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-gameplay-is-being-leaked-online-as-early-copies-are-already-in-players-hands.1116930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Early physical copies of Assassin’s Creed Shadows have already found their way in players hands, resulting in early gameplay of the game being streamed and uploaded online.</p>



<p>According to X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/DannyStevens__/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DannyStevens__</a>, copies of the game are obtainable via Facebook Marketplace. Insider Gaming were unable to find any copies on Facebook’s UK marketplace, Stevens’ claims were backed up with pictures of the games case, the install screen, and several gameplay photos. Those images have since been deleted.</p>



<p>After searching for the game online further, it seems that Ubisoft is aware of the situation and is currently DMCA striking a lot of the content posted online. Inevitably though, some gameplay and images will fall through the cracks, so be aware if you’re sensitive of spoilers.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-assassins-creed-shadows-free-download-bonus-weapon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – How to Get Assassin’s Creed Shadows Free Download Bonus Weapon</a></strong></p>



<p>It’s unclear on why copies of the game have started to be sold at such as early stage, as typically, physical copies begin leaked around 2-3 days before launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows was delayed twice</a>, including a recent delay that moved the game from its February 14 release to March 20, so it’s possible that the game had already been printed on masse.</p>



<p>It was said that the second delay was needed to give the game “additional weeks” to implement changes based on feedback received from players during testing.</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté said, “since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us. “Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is scheduled to release on March 20, 2025 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. Ubisoft sources tell Insider Gaming that the company is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confident on its new release date</a>.</p>

Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches officially on March 20, 2025.

Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-insists-assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-are-tracking-solidly-in-line-with-odyssey">Ubisoft insisted that Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong number of preorders</a> despite its troubled development and promotional period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The struggling publisher said in its latest financial report that "preorders for the game are tracking solidly, in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the second most successful entry of the franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained this confidence. "Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-players-wont-be-missing-out-if-they-largely-ignore-one-protagonist"><u>the dual protagonist approach</u></a>,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to commend the incredible talent and dedication of the entire Assassin’s Creed’s team, who is working tirelessly to ensure that Shadows delivers on the promise of what is the franchise’s most ambitious entry yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally planned for November before Ubisoft bumped it back to February 14.

            <p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-more-netease-studios-like-quantic-and-grasshopper-at-risk-as-firm-reportedly-seeks-buyers">reports circulated over the weekend that NetEase is allegedly pulling back on its international game investments</a> by "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios", NetEase-owned Rebel Wolves has reached out to assuage fears, reiterating that NetEase is a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to LinkedIn, Rebel Wolves' chief publishing officer and co-owner, Tomasz Tinc said he was aware of the "rumoured situation" but said that Rebel Wolves' ownership largely rested in the hands of studio employees.</p>
<p>The company is currently at work on The Blood of Dawnwalker, a project headed up by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, who is also a studio co-owner.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," Tinc wrote.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves. NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder."</p>
<p>Tinc also confirmed that production of he Blood of Dawnwalker is "fully funded", and it was working alongside the studio's partners and publisher Bandai Namco to "bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life".</p>
<p>NetEase's backtrack arguably commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese megacorp <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is 2K’s newest golf sequel, and its Xbox Game Pass and status is up in the air—like a well-struck golf shot. That’s why we’re here today to let you know if you need to pay your green fee, or if this one’s on the house.</p>



<p>The golf game market is hotter than it’s ever been. EA Sports PGA Tour is the up-and-coming Pro making a big impression, but the PGA Tour 2K series is the evergreen veteran of the links. Take-Two’s newest golf title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>—carrying on the company’s trend of biannual releases.</p>



<p>2K’s franchise has a healthy following of fans—myself included—but let’s see if the audience can grow thanks to the Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pga-tour-2k25-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play PGA Tour 2K25 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A warm welcome indeed. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t available as a day-one release on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</strong></p>



<p>Consider <a href="https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGA Tour 2K25</a> a private membership. Not a single PGA Tour 2K25 trailer or prerelease gameplay video has made any mention of the sports title coming to Game Pass. It’s hardly a shock though. Few (if any) sports titles come to Game Pass on day one. I also can’t recall any 2K sports title doing this either.</p>



<p>You must go through each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pga-tour-2k25-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</a> and agonize over which one you want. Each Edition is TaylorMade for a different type of PGA Tour 2K fan. You must consider if you want the base game, extra content on top, or everything and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pga-tour-2k25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will PGA Tour 2K25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data suggests PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass later on.</strong></p>



<p>A quick browse of recent history shows neither PGA Tour 2K23 or 2K21 have come to Game Pass. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with it, but you <em>can </em>play EA Sports Tour on Game Pass. There might be some exclusivity rights there, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, if you’re hoping to play PGA Tour 2K25 through Xbox Game Pass, my advice would be to not sit around in the grandstand and wait for Game Pass to take the first shot.</p>



<hr>



<p>What will you do? Are you prepared to dive into your pocket to try out the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-courses-in-pga-tour-2k25-dlc-courses-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courses</a> and features? Or will you wait for a sale and bide your time for PGA Tour 2K25?</p>



<p>We also have the Xbox Game Pass status of quite a few other titles for you to check out: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-split-fiction-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-or-ea-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-sniper-elite-resistance-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-coming-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>.</p>

            <p>
Obsidian's fun and colourful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> doesn't sound like a one-and-done effort by the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Avowed arrived last week to a positive reception, and now a Bloomberg interview with the game's director Carrie Patel includes the suggestion we'll see more of the franchise from Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
Asked whether Patel's next project would be something new, the director said that work on more Avowed content - be that for this game, or sequels - was more likely.

</figure>
<p>
"Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it," Patel said.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian has invested more than six years in Avowed, and longer in its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe. Development on the project began in 2018, two years prior to the company's acquisition by Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Initially planned as a multiplayer version of Skyrim with a massive open world, Obsidian ditched the game's online component relatively early on. After Patel came on board to lead the game in 2021, the decision was then made to also switch the game's map from open world to multiple large open zones. The game also ended up leaning further into the Pillars of Eternity universe's lore than initially planned, too.
</p>
<p>
"With any game you think, 'OK, we can't climb every mountain  - which ones are really worth the effort for us?'" Patel said. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with open zones, and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next."
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-studio-plans-to-make-its-100th-birthday-by-staying-lean-and-invested">Obsidian said it was planning to still be open for its 100th anniversary</a> - in another 78 years - by staying "lean and invested".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-gets-a-countdown-to-4th-march-reveal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 looks like it’s on the way with an annoucnement on the 4th of March. It’s a reveal date that will only make sense to Americans and their back-to-front way of writing dates, the announcement coming on “03.04.25”, the countdown set to conclude at 3PM GMT / 10AM ET / 7AM PT.</p>
<p>The first teaser came from the appropriately named new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> map, Grind – reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577">Charlie Intel</a>. the map features a skatepark as its main area, but also has a skating themed shop, which plays host to a TV screen that proudly proclaims the 03.04.25 date with a THPS style logo.</p>


<p>That imagery has been replicated on the THPS website, which has the date and countdown to an announcement.</p>
<p>This all comes off the back of long-running reports and rumours surrounding a follow up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</a> remake. Following that game’s 2020 release, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/06/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-plans-shelved-after-blizzard-entertainment-absorbed-vicarious-visions-says-tony-hawk">Tony Hawk said</a> that a follow up was planned, but shelved after Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Blizzard Entertainment, rebranded as Blizzard Albany and set to work on the Diablo series.</p>
<p>Rumours about the project were revived recently when skater Tyshawn Jones<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1314"> said in a radio interview</a> that he is set to be in an upcoming <em>Tony Hawk</em> game remaster.</p>
<p>It’s not clear right now who is working on Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4. There’s obviously nothing stopping Blizzard Albany working on this as they still exist within the overarching Activision Blizzard structure, and depending on workloads since the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/">Diablo IV</a> in 2023, and surrounding the Vessels of Hatred DLC last year.</p>

<p>Looking back at THPS 1+2, we awarded the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">a stellar 10/10</a>, saying “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+ 2 is a labour of love and an ode to the series’ glory days. Every inch of the game has been perfectly restored and updated for modern consoles and it’s an absolute delight to play from start to finish. This is a must-buy for skateboarders, gamers and everyone else in between.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/behold-the-essential-oil-diffusing-fragrance-mouse.1116900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-essential-oil-diffusing-fragrance-mouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>"The cat is the fragrance, Nic," Ollie once told me when I asked the RPS Slack channel for alternatives to my essential oil diffuser, which I can no longer use for fear of my cat getting vanilla scurvy or lavender botulism or whatever else. I contemplated those words last night when she pounced into bed with me, curled up, and serenaded me to slumber with a briney fart. I remembered them again this morning when I learned of the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-fragrance-mouse-release/">ASUS Fragrance Mouse</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valve-bans-games-that-rely-on-in-game-ads-from-steam-so-no-watch-this-to-continue-playing-stuff-will-be-making-its-way-to-our-pcs/">Percy Gamer</a>.)</p>
<p>The mouse is ergonomic, wireless, and comes in plain or pink ("Iridescent White or Rose Clay"). Its innards house a refillable vial for scent oils. It features "delicate underglow lighting," a sell  that would be easier to make fun of if most gaming hardware wasn't illuminated by a choice of either energy drink piss green or antiseptic gel blue.</p>

</figure>
<p>Would I use this if I hadn't a cat? Silly question. I would immediately source a cat. Ah, but what if she was theoretically immune to essential oils and also not sick of being used in dangerous hypotheticals as I assume all cats are by now?</p>
<p>A tendency toward anxious agoraphobia has made me someone who spends a lot time cultivating vibes. I would venture that I own more fairy lights, houseplants, IDM playlists and tiny lamps shaped like mushrooms than most people who don't also use Instagram. I owned both a scent diffuser and an apocalypse bunker's worth of Nag Champa before my cat's arrival meant I had to stop using them. I am, on paper, the exact genre of mark that should fall for this.</p>
<p>And yet, I cannot help but view it as an admission of defeat. As PC Gamer deftly note, the fragrance mouse is "the first development in mouse I've seen in some time that wasn't just 'more button". Its very existence feels like a thwarted admission that there are no new ideas left in the world (of mice) and thus ASUS have resorted to just shoving in things that already exist and, I must assume, are much more suited for the task when they don't also have to fight for space with mouse brains.</p>
<p>Why, if we're just doing that, I bet I could source several better ideas from the morass of Monday morning ennui that is the RPS Slack in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>"A mouse encased in a magic ball that somehow attaches itself firmly to any surface, including your own leg, so that you can wield it dexterously enough to play an FPS without needing a desk," says Edwin.</p>
<p>"A mouse with a mouse's tail; it's fairly unobtrusive most of the time but it sometimes displays excitement or affection, wrapping itself around your wrist or wagging like a dog's when you knock someone in Apex," suggests Ollie.</p>
<p>"A vertical mouse for work that changes into a normal mouse when you want to play a precise FPS. A Transformer mouse," adds Brendy.</p><p>

"A mouse with a pencil sharpener in it. Just for the irony", says James.

</p><p>Me? Idk. A…toaster? Little tiny toaster? Makes you little tiny bits of toast that you can nibble on to make you feel better about burning your fingers on your stupid toaster mouse?</p>
<p>I do not hate the fragrance mouse. Benign bewilderment is an entertaining emotion. However, my desk only has room for one scent.</p>

            <p>A former Nintendo employee has predicted the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> will launch in June, with a release date announcement due in the forthcoming Direct in April.</p>
<p>The employee, known only as Sean, was sales lead in Nintendo's sales and retail department and appeared on the Kit and Krista podcast - also former Nintendo employees.</p>
<p>"They're going to want the system to be out before the end of the summer," said Sean, discussing a potential release date for Switch 2. "I would say at the start of the summer - end of school year, so you've got the kids in school talking about what they're excited for.</p>

<p>"I think we'll see a June launch, I'm thinking probably mid-June, maybe a little bit later than that. But definitely before the end of the summer that thing's coming out."</p>
<p>There are "good strategic reasons" for this, he said, from that end of school year point, to the ability for retailers to sell Switch 2 bundles at Christmas time. If the console launches at the end of the year, it means "something wasn't ready", Sean suggested.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 hands-on tour</a> begins in April and ends in June, too.</p>
<p>Another point of discussion in the podcast was the price point, specifically the upper limit.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine it being too much more than $400… maybe $450 is the highest I can imagine," said Sean.</p>
<p>That's based on him not knowing the specific tech specs, though he's "sure" the Switch 2 will have an Nvidia chip and be the next generation of the existing Switch chip. Further, he doesn't think it will have an OLED screen as Nintendo will be making "trade-offs" to hit a specific price point.</p>
<p>What's more, the original Switch likely won't drop in price right away at Switch 2's launch. "Don't be surprised if Black Friday comes around and you can get an OLED Switch for a smoking good deal," he said.</p>
<p>Sean also had some ideas to assist with pre-orders and the launch. That included using pre-orders to judge retailer allocation, but how can Nintendo know it's a real pre-order and not a scammer? Sean suggested tying pre-orders to Nintendo Online accounts when purchasing direct from the company, either to prioritise those pre-orders or require it.</p>
<p>This is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hits-snooze-on-alarmos-public-release">Nintendo required for sales of its Alarmo clock</a>, which Sean suggested was an intentional test ahead of Switch 2 pre-orders.</p>
<p>Another idea he had would be that consoles arrive with software preloaded on them, based on the games customers purchase. This is by no means confirmed, but just a cool idea he'd love to see implemented.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sean dispelled the myth that retailers had information now on Switch 2's launch. Retailers know "nothing" at this point, he said, be that price or launch date. Any articles from retailers are just them guessing, not leaking actual information.</p>
<p>"When we know the launch date, that's probably when retailers will know the launch date, or maybe a week or two in advance of that," he said.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, Nintendo revised its financial forecast as it failed to hit sales targets with the current Switch, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-says-switch-2-anticipation-not-to-blame-for-falling-switch-1-sales">president Shuntaro Furukawa said this wasn't due to interest in the Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo Direct on the Switch 2</a> will take place on 2nd April, where we'll presumably hear about the release date and price.</p>
<p>Until then, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know about Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Also on the way is Mortal Kombat's Madam Bo Kameo fighter. Initially, she only appeared as a minor NPC in the story campaign, but now she's making her fighting debut, too.</p>
<p>T-1000 and Madam Bo are arriving with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-dlc-announced-animalities-t-1000-conan-and-screams-ghostface-all-on-the-way">Mortal Kombat 1 DLC Khaos Reigns</a>, which will expand the game's story campaign with an all-new cinematic narrative.</p>
<p>"When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger," reads the <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-223900046.html">official blurb</a>. "If they fail, the New Era will be reduced to anarchy."</p>
<p>Kombat Pack 1 - which includes additional fighters to add to the roster - and is out now and contains Omni-Man (Invincible), Quan Chi, Peacemaker (DC’s Peacemaker), Ermac, Homelander (The Boys), and Takeda Takahashi.</p>
<p>T-1000, however, is coming as part of Kombat Pack 2, alongside Scream's Ghostface, Conan the Barbarian, Noob Saibot (voiced by Kaiji Tang) Cyrax (voiced by Enuka Okuma), and Sektor (voiced by Erika Ishii).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-remasters-could-be-announced-on-the-franchises-20th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We first <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-rumored-to-be-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> rumors about the God of War Greek saga remaster plan in October 2024. That rumor suggested Sony Santa Monica would be working with Nixxes Software to enhance the beloved original trilogy for modern hardware.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckoned</a> the announcement would come at the February State of Play, but that turned out to be incorrect. Now, insider Jeff Grubb has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bdacp2cmuuyawx553cv2spdy/post/3liqdacmdnc23?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the news could be officially confirmed in time for the franchise's 20th anniversary. This would land on March 22, which marked the original game's debut in North America (Europe, as was customary back then, had to wait until July 7).</p>
<p>We don't have any details on what would be included. However, we can guess there would be significant graphical improvements over the previous remasters (the first two games were remastered for PlayStation 3, and the last one for PlayStation 4), as well as possibly some quality-of-life enhancements. It is highly unlikely that it would be anything more than that, as that'd make it more of a remake than a remaster, and the scope of a full-fledged remake of the God of War trilogy would be massive.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Sony would be willing to bring those games back to the market once again. While they do serve as a backstory for Kratos as we've seen him in the Norse mythology continuation, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series adaptation in the making at Amazon Prime Video</a> will be based on the latter, not on the Greek saga. As a reminder, the adaptation was originally meant to be led by Rafe Judkins, but the showrunner left the project and was replaced in late 2024 by Ronald D. Moore, who is known for his work on acclaimed TV shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, and For All Mankind.</p>

            <p>
Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza has found its sea legs on Steam, where it launched to the series' second-biggest concurrent player haul to date.
</p>
<p>
A peak of 22,327 PC players played Pirate Yakuza over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3061810/charts/#1w">Steam's own stats</a> - avast total higher than every other game in the franchise to date, save Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Steam itself broke its all-time concurrent user record once more - this time to hit 39.92 million online users. Prior to this, the record stood at 39.3 million, from back in December 2024.

</figure>
<p>
While a better start than most of the (many) other Yakuza/Like A Dragon games, including 2023's Like A Dragon: Ishin! and The Man Who Erased His Name, RGG Studio's nautical spin-off still saw around half of the players at launch as last year's Infinite Wealth, which peaked at 46,161 concurrent players total.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, Pirate Yakuza is most definitely a spin-off from the main series. On the other - pirates!
</p>
<p>
"A raucous, absurd spin-off that manages to still feel like a first-rate Yakuza game despite the leftfield setting and delightfully unhinged plot," Matt Elliot wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Eurogamer's Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza review</a>. "All of this somehow coalesces into something that works in defiance of itself."

            <p>Actor Yuri Lowenthal, the voice behind Peter Parker in Insomanic's games, has confirmed the original Spider-Man won't be sidelined in the series' third chapter.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Lowenthal stated there were "very few things" he could say about Insomniac's yet to actually be announced next Spider-Man game right now, but assured fans that "Peter is not gone" by any means.</p>
<p>"He will be a part of the next game and he won't be relegated to the couch, I promise," Lowenthal said. <strong>Beware some Marvel's Spider-Man 2 spoilers below.</strong></p>

<p>Those who have completed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> will know that the game ends with Peter Parker essentially handing the webby torch over to Miles Morales. While Miles as Spider-Man will take care of New York, Peter was going to focus more on his personal life with Mary Jane, and also build the Emily-May Foundation after it got fairly ripped to shreds during the fight with Venom.</p>
<p>The game then rounds out with two mid-credits scenes, clearly pathing the way for that third entry. The first of these scenes sees Norman Osborn - devastated by his son Harry's comatose state, and who blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery - popping over to The Raft to visit Dr Octavius. He seems on course to become the Green Goblin, one of the Spider-Man series' main antagonists.</p>
<p>A second scene focusing on Miles' family introduces us very briefly to his mother's new boyfriend Albert Moon, and Albert's daughter, Cindy. Cindy Moon, for those unaware, is another person in the Marvel universe who gets bitten and given powers by a radioactive spider. She becomes the superhero Silk.</p>
<p>Guides writer Marie and I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-marvels-spider-man-2">chatted at length about where the next game could go following Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, and we theorised Miles may take Cindy under his wing and show her the Spidey ropes much like Peter did with him. At first we assumed this would mean Peter would have more of a 'cameo-like' role in the next game, but given what Lowenthal has said, it seems he may have a bigger role than first thought.</p>
<p>What are your hopes for Peter and co in the next Marvel's Spider-Man game?</p>

<p>While Lowenthal's comments have sparked plenty of chatter, Marvel's Spider-Man 3 is perhaps still a way off. After all, the studio still has its Wolverine release in the works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". Last month, Insomniac's newly appointed studio head Chad Dezern acknowledged the "pent up excitement" around the game, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">refrained from confirming or denying a 2025 release window for Wolverine</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful launch of Avowed</a>, Pillars of Eternity creator Josh Sawyer did an LA Wild Fire Relief Stream yesterday <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2388422071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Obsidian's Twitch channel</a>. During the lengthy stream, he played the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released game</a> and talked about various topics.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sawyer revealed that there's quite a lot of interest within the team to make a 'Pillars Tactics' game, although there is uncertainty about its commercial success.</p>
<p><em>Pillars Tactics is a thing that a lot of people at the studio would like to work on, and there are a lot of people who like tactics games. Figuring out a scope for it is tricky. A scope of development where it feels like it could actually make money, because tactics games have a very enthusiastic fan base, but the fan base is not humongous. It's sort of like that floor is high - like, if you make a decent tactics game, those people are going to buy it. But if all of them buy it, that's still not that many people.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, following the incredible success of Baldur's Gate 3, Sawyer <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> he'd love to do a more tactical, turn-based Pillars of Eternity 3 if Microsoft would only provide the triple-A budget for it.</p>
<p><em>I think that would be a lot of fun to do, to do like a high production value party based fantasy RPG. I’m pretty happy with Pillars and Deadfire, but I do think that if it were not crowdfunded, I would probably make it turn based. I’m not saying to not have a real time with pause system, but I do think that the Deadfire turn based system which I can’t take credit for, that Nick Carver and Brian MacIntosh did, was really cool. But, the game wasn’t designed for it, so actually designing the game for turn based, fewer encounters, smaller encounters, but much more tactical, I think that would be a lot of fun, and having awesome cinematics and all that stuff.</em></p>
<p>Still, as things stand, it seems more likely that Obsidian will continue making first-person action RPGs like Avowed and the upcoming The Outer Worlds 2, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch sometime this year</a>.</p>

		<p>At first glance, Shotgun Cop Man might not seem like the bigger-and-better follow-up to indie hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">My Friend Pedro</a> that many would’ve expected. It’s got a stripped back aesthetic, and the gameplay has shifted from slow-motion chaos to more minimalist micro-movement platforming. It’s a surprising shift in scope and style, but after getting my hands on the debut demo for the game, I see the vision.</p>
<p>It’s not that this game is a smaller and simpler project. Instead, it skews so deftly into an efficient, minimalist approach to art-style and gameplay that it’s more like I’m playing the long-awaited sequel to N++. A sequel with shotguns and Satan in it.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARREST SATAN in SHOTGUN COP MAN | From the Creator of My Friend Pedro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a narrative hook to Shotgun Cop Man,&nbsp;but it’s been written on a napkin and dangled from broken fishing-line and, honestly, that’s totally fine. You are Shotgun Cop Man, and your job is to go to Hell and arrest Satan. It’s so obnoxiously and hilariously barebones that it immediately accomplished two things for me. Firstly, it made me laugh a lot. Secondly,, it made it clear that the focus is all on the gameplay, and just the act of playing in itself.</p>
<p>It’s an act which is fun as Hell, by the way. This is a side-scrolling platformer where you have no jump button. Instead, you use your right-trigger to fire a pistol that shot propels you a little bit so you can hover in the air, or you use your left-trigger to fire a massive shotgun blast that propels you much further in your direction of choice. These weapons are also meant to be used as literal weapons, though, with demons scattered throughout each level trying to shoot you before you can make it to the exit.</p>


<p>So, the loop immediately reveals itself and it hooked me in an instant. Every bullet you fire isn’t just a potential hit on an enemy, but also a sudden force of momentum that flings you in the opposite direction. Thinking about gunfire and platforming not as parallel actions, but as a yin and yang that flow into each other is really fascinating. As I progressed through the demo, I got a hang of things and learned how a shotgun blast could kill an enemy while also propelling me closer to the next one, or how a pistol shot could cancel my momentum from a shotgun blast just before I hit a deadly obstacle. The flow is simple, but so satisfying.</p>
<p>What I also appreciate about Shotgun Cop Man is that it’s incredibly forgiving despite the twitch-precision platformer DNA that runs through it all. When you get hit by a bullet or obstacle, you lose your heart, but can keep playing and even grab your floating heart to return to normal. Getting hit with no heart triggers an immediate and hilarious death-screen, but when you continue from there, you’re placed at a very forgiving checkpoint right near where you died. Freaks who want the thrill of a no-death run can fully restart and chase that high, but being able to zone out a bit and comfortably clear a level with that much assistance is a nice change of pace from the usual difficulty present in these games.</p>

<p>There’s a clear, consistent, and super fun design goal behind Shotgun Cop Man, and I’m all for it. This demo is a short and sweet slice of a game that I can’t wait to continue playing.</p>
<p><em>Try Shotgun Cop Man for yourself now, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966870/Shotgun_Cop_Man_Demo/">a PC demo available with Steam Next Fest</a>. Shotgun Cop Man is coming to PC and Switch in 2025.</em></p>

<p>At a recent benefit held to fundraise for those impacted by the LA wildfires, Yuri Lowenthal caught up with one publication about Spider-Man 3. The benefit – MultiCon – was held on February 22 and featured guests such as Rob Liefeld, Kevin Smith, and Seth Green, and Lowenthal, who has played Peter Parker since 2018’s Spider-Man, was also in attendance.</p>



<p>He couldn’t say much, but what he confirmed was that Peter Parker is not gone in Spider-Man 3 and will still play a pivotal part in the campaign, despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 might suggest.</p>

<p>In a report published by <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, it was confirmed by Yuri Lowenthal himself that Peter Parker is not ‘relegated to the couch’ in Spider-Man 3, which will be developed by Insomniac Games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are very few things that I can say about this game, but you have somehow landed on the one thing that I can answer, and that’s that, yes, Peter is not gone. He will be a part of the next game and he won’t be relegated to the couch, I promise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The running theory is that Spider-Man 3 will have <strong>three </strong>protagonists, much like 2013’s Grand Theft Auto 5. It’s envisioned that players will be able to utilise the live switching mechanic introduced in Spider-Man 2 to flick between these heroes at the press of a button and that the third playable character will be Cindy Moon, otherwise known as Silk.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2’s fluidity between protagonists allowed players to soak up a dual perspective, with each protagonist – Peter Parker and Miles Morales – boasting unique abilities and aesthetics.</p>



<p>One protagonist is the norm, two is rarer but not unheard of, and three protagonists is downright nuts for some gamers to comprehend, but in an expansive open-world hero title like Spider-Man, it just might work. The third game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-creative-director-teases-a-third-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">been teased since 2023</a>, so it could be revealed soon. Could three be the magic number?</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League’s second Minor tournament is approaching, but it seems not every team is prepared for it. It has been a month since OpTic Texas won a single map in competitive play, scoring 1 – 3 in a loss against the Carolina Royal Ravens at Major I in Madrid.</p>



<p>This poor losing streak, which now sits at zero maps won to nine lost, comes after Pred rejoined the roster, which many fans are now starting to judge as an erroneous action. Up next, OpTic Texas will face the Vegas Falcons at Major II, and that has the Green Wall <strong>concerned</strong>.</p>



<p>Will the Vegas Falcons’ first win come over OpTic Texas, the reigning Call of Duty League Championship winner?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mighty-have-fallen">The Mighty Have Fallen</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas went into Major I as the favourite to win, but the team got passed from pillar to post, being pushed into the lower bracket by the Heretics and then being ejected entirely by the Carolina Royal Ravens. It was Atlanta FaZe that ultimately lifted the trophy in Madrid.</p>



<p>Nobody could have predicted what would happen thereafter.</p>



<p>OpTic Texas has failed to win a map in three fixtures, a fact that is having a visible impact on the squad. Following a loss against Atlanta FaZe on February 15, OpTic’s Dashy seized his camera and tried snapping it. In terms of map records, OpTic Texas isn’t alone at the bottom of the table.</p>



<p>The Vegas Falcons are yet to win a single match, and so far this stage, the team has secured a map record of 2 – 12. Similarly, LAG M8 has produced a map record of just 3 – 9 with zero game wins.</p>



<p>In a dire spot, the Vegas Falcons have found themselves the laughingstock of the Call of Duty League. They’ve never won more than a single map in any series, and they haven’t come close to producing a single CDL point in the pro standings.</p>



<p>This past week of competitive play was a boon for some teams, though. The LA Thieves produced a 3 – 0 record, beating Carolina, Vegas, and Ultra without too many issues. In stark contrast to OpTic Texas, LAT secured that win record while dropping just <strong>one map</strong>.</p>



<p>Surge has also won every fixture so far in the run-up to the Major II tournament in Texas. It was just a couple of weeks back that Surge announced the signing of Neptune, an appropriately-named player who stepped up to replace Hicksy. He has proven to be a star player already, with the team walking all over Cloud9, LAG M8, and even Atlanta FaZe, the Minor I and Major I champions.</p>
