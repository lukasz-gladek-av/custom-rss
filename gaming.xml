Acer's 50mm drivers provide a robust soundscape for the price, so it's a solid option for a travel headset or for casual and younger players shopping on a budget. Most impressively, the headset can run for up to 100 hours on a full charge.</p><p>It's also versatile thanks to 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth support. On PlayStation consoles, you'll need to connect the wireless receiver to your console's USB port to establish a connection. PC players can sync wirelessly via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth, with the latter also providing compatibility for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, Steam Deck, mobile, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A wired connection is available with the included, detachable 3.5mm audio cable. The microphone for chat has built-in noise-canceling tech, but it's worth mentioning that the mic will not work with Nintendo Switch consoles.</p><p>As mentioned, the cheapest model at the moment is black with red accents on the headband and exterior earcups, but there are other accents as well as two models with a white base color. All models come with plush earcups and a cushioned, plastic headband. Keep in mind that cheap headsets tend to wear down faster than pricier models due to material quality.</p><p><strong>Acer wireless headset deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLYH2DRN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Red</a> -- $34 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L637P6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pink</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L2QFF1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blue</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L3HLYH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L3HHKF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orange</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPQB42N1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pastel Pink</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPQ7CRWS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>If you are in the market for a new headset in the $100 range, SteelSeries has just launched a new wireless model in its popular Arctis Nova range, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F9548L67,B0F94KTF6C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Arctis Nova 3 Wireless</a>.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At an event like Summer Game Fest, where demos and trailers are coming from every direction, the really special experiences are the ones that stay with me long after my demo time has ended. Whether it's the game I try, or the conversation surrounding it, the games I continue to think about days or weeks afterward are the ones I most heartily recommend others explore as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For SGF 2025, that game was Ambrosia Sky, the first project from Toronto-based Soft Rains Studio. The brief demo I played seems like a "clean-'em-up" style game like Powerwash Simulator, but the underlying story surrounding those cleanup missions is so interesting and introspective that it has stuck with me ever since. There is a respect and reverence paid to the dead in Ambrosia Sky that video games routinely lack, and I think that respect is going to lead to a very emotional story when the game is complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Ambrosia Sky is pretty straightforward: I control a woman named Dalia, who holds the role of "Scarab"--this world's version of a "mortician." She's someone who is tasked with disposing of bodies, collecting mushroom samples around those bodies, and testing them to try and find a way to rid the universe of the invasive fungus. As Dalia, I enter a cluster colony near the rings of Saturn, as I've been assigned a recently deceased man to examine.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVVYIfCX6tg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVVYIfCX6tg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As the demo begins, I'm armed with a pistol-like tool that shoots cleansing water and other elements to remove fungus I see in my path. Some fungi hold special properties--one strain is electrified and can damage me if I get too close, while another is highly flammable and can be destroyed over time with a well-placed flame shot from my tool.</p><p dir="ltr">One room requires me to solve a puzzle by routing electricity to a dormant power terminal in order to unlock the door next to it. I learn that I can use a sample of the electrified fungus to shoot a version of it from my tool, which I can use to create a path from a nearby light on the ceiling to the power terminal, giving it the electricity it needs for me to proceed. It's a neat trick, as it gives a small "aha!" moment and makes me wonder how other elemental blasts will come into play.</p><p dir="ltr">I reach my target and begin the process of disposing of the body and collecting the sample--and this is where Ambrosia Sky ascended from "simple cleaning game" to "thought-provoking experience." Rather than simply standing and watching while the corpse fades away and converts to the sample I need, I watch through Dalia's eyes as she starts the process, and then quietly kneels in front of the deceased, her hands on her lap.</p><p dir="ltr">She places herself in a pose of reflection, respect, and reverence for the dead, creating a moment I found beautiful and poignant. In her own way, she is paying respect to the departed, and I didn't have to press F to achieve it--it was part of the normal gameplay experience.</p><p dir="ltr">This, co-founder Joel Burgess told me after the demo ended, was completely intentional.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea of after-death care is something we've thought about a lot; there's a combination of sterility and intimacy in it, acting at the same time," Burgess said. "Treating these bodies with respect has been very pervasive throughout, with the challenge being how we actually portray that through actions and presentation."</p><p dir="ltr">Dalia--whose name certainly sounds like it was intentional given the themes of death and dying, but Burgess would not confirm or deny--went through multiple iterations on how she acts around these dead people throughout the development process, Burgess explained. "How does Dalia touch a thing? Is she handling this object a bit too rough?" he says. "That, plus the kneeling posture shown in the demo, are all parts of us trying to convey that respect."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861"></a><figcaption>Ambrosia Sky</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515862,1300-4515863,1300-4515864,1300-4515865,1300-4515866,1300-4515867,1300-4515868" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's also a personal layer to this story for Dalia--one that the demo alludes to through in-game messages, but doesn't outright call out. Dalia is a former citizen of this cluster, and the person she's tasked with collecting is someone she knew before she left 15 years prior. In fact, if you search the target's terminal across the room from where the body is found, you'll find that he archived the last message he received from Dalia before she left.</p><p dir="ltr">That personal connection is at the root of Dalia's reverence for those she's tasked with performing these last rites for, and Burgess and his team not only explore that through her, but also through environmental storytelling like the terminal above. Every corpse Dalia comes across on her way to her target can be analyzed, and doing so is usually followed by Dalia paying her respects by saying something to the effect of, "I'm sorry I couldn't help you."</p><p dir="ltr">The personal elements to Dalia's story have layers of their own, too: Other in-game messages reference the fact that, in order for a corpse to be collected by a Scarab for this research, the deceased must give consent before they pass away. It's also brought to light that our target only gave his consent moments before he died; Burgess says that, if you look hard enough, you'll learn that the deceased knew Dalia became a Scarab--and that she would be assigned to his collection should he give his consent.</p><p dir="ltr">The layers upon layers of storytelling contained in a game that, on the surface, involves simply removal of fungus from a space station, is what makes Ambrosia Sky so interesting. The focus on death--and particularly the payment of respect to those who have passed--also possesses a universal appeal, which is why Burgess and his team decided to place it at the center of their story.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the end of the day, death comes for all of us; it doesn't matter what culture you're from, what your background is, your age," Burgess said. "You will die, you will know people who pass, you will go through this as well." That relatability, once Ambrosia Sky is released, has the chance to resonate with everyone who decides to give it a try.</p><p dir="ltr">Ambrosia Sky is "coming soon" on PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Most Nintendo fans are familiar with Totaka's Song: a short, 19-note melody that composer Kazumi Totaka famously hides in every game he's ever worked on. K.K. Slider once crooned it to a villager in Animal Crossing, while Luigi's Mansion and Pikmin 2 both play the song if you sit on a certain menu screen for too long. Now, the melody has surfaced in Mario Kart World, which makes for the 25th confirmed instance of the melody being hidden in a Nintendo game.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-long-running-musical-easter-egg-has-been-found-in-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, a Reddit user by the name of "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">charizardtelephone</a>" found the song in the latest Mario Kart's character-select screen. By moving the cursor to Yoshi and leaving it there, the cute little dino starts humming the familiar tune.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is not the first time the song has appeared in a Mario Kart game, nor is it the first time Yoshi is the one singing it--in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, if you move your kart close to a Yoshi watching the race, you'll hear Yoshi's voice singing the tune there as well. Fittingly, Totaka himself has provided the voice of Yoshi since Yoshi's Story in 1998.</p><p dir="ltr">Totaka's Song first appeared in X, which was released in 1990 for the Game Boy, before making an appearance in Mario Paint in 1992. Since then, it has appeared in 25 different games, including multiple titles in the Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, and Yoshi franchises. Its most recent appearance before this was 2020's Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players could request it by asking K.K. Slider to play "K.K. Song."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156822/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2013 (!), Square Enix released a game in Japan for the 3DS called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy</a>, which (after a modest update) eventually received a Western release as just <strong>Bravely Default</strong>. At the time, the company had been focusing development resources much more heavily on games it believed would appeal more strongly to Western audiences, and the developers were shocked when fans responded with overwhelming positivity to a release that they expected to flop overseas. Now that a handful of direct and spiritual sequels have since been made, Square Enix returns to where it all began with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>. Though not exactly a comprehensive overhaul, this remaster stands as a solid refresh of this JRPG classic.</p>
<p>Bravely Default takes place in the world of Luxendarc, which sits on the brink of chaos as the four elemental crystals that maintain balance have been consumed by a mysterious darkness. You begin the adventure as a boy named Tiz, whose entire village was destroyed in the devastating cataclysm that followed the crystals falling to darkness, and soon pair up with Agnes and her cutesy flying fairy companion. As a member of the crystal orthodoxy, Agnes shares that she’s on a mission to cleanse the darkness from the crystals and restore balance to the land, kicking off a quest to save the world while evading capture from the forces of the Eternian Duchy.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154962/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>What begins as a rather rote JRPG plot slowly becomes something much more interesting with the introduction of certain controversial plot twists later in the game. Suffice it to say, the story isn’t what it initially appears to be, and while the execution of those controversial plot elements could have perhaps been done better, I appreciate how the developers sought to upend expectations. It is, at the very least, a <em>memorable</em> plot, which is far more than many ‘inoffensive’ JRPGs can say.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Bravely Default draws heavy inspiration from the classic era of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>, but with a dash of modern polish and tweaks to make things flow more smoothly. Case in point, enemy encounters are still random when you’re out in dungeons or the overworld, but you can easily adjust the encounter rate on a variable scale to either double the norm if you want to go all out while grinding or to zero if you just want to explore without being interrupted every few minutes by another gang of mooks.</p>
<p>The blueprint is familiar in that you still explore an overworld, battle enemies in turn-based combat, develop your party, and delve into dungeons for loot and boss fights, yet the developers clearly considered how they could modernise certain aspects of the loop.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156815/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The combat system is arguably the most lauded aspect of Bravely Default, largely due to the fun and creative way that it approaches playing with the economy of a standard turn-based battle system. On any character’s turn, you can choose to 'Brave' to borrow up to three extra turns (and thus three extra actions) from your character’s future self to utilise <em>right now</em>, but doing so will create a deficit in which that character then spends up to three turns completely idle and open to any enemy retaliation.</p>
<p>On the other end, the standard ‘defend’ option is replaced with the 'Default' command, in which your character defends and stores an extra turn action that can then be spent later via Defaulting.</p>
<p>In practice, this leads to a dynamic battle system that rewards careful planning and strategy as you cautiously weave between pressing the attack and falling back on defence. A random encounter with a pack of low-level goons can be easily wiped in one turn by having every character Brave and go all-in on the offensive before your foes even get a chance to respond.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156831/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile the opening minutes of a boss fight may be best navigated by having your designated healer Default for the first few turns to stock up on extra actions to use later for when the whole party gets damaged by a strong AoE attack. I appreciated the increased agency that this combat system affords, as it leads to much more interesting battles with mightier foes as you carefully balance the turns that each character stores and spends.</p>
<p>Another standout feature here is the Job system, which quickly gives you quite a bit of material to work with for teambuilding. As you progress the story and complete side content, you’ll collect ‘asterisks’ that each grant you a new Job that brings with it a unique blend of new commands, support abilities, equipment aptitude, and stat allocations. Each party member can independently level each of the Jobs, growing their proficiency and unlocking more powerful abilities as they progress.</p>
<p>But the real interesting bit comes in when you realise that you can effectively equip a <em>secondary</em> job to a character, allowing them to mix the skills and abilities between jobs that they’ve gained proficiency in.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156836/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, the Spiritmaster has an ability that diminishes damage output, but bolsters recovery magic. Pair this with the recovery magic casts of a White Mage, and you can have a designated healer who can punch quite a bit above their weight in terms of the heals they can put out.</p>
<p>The Job system was clearly designed for players to find exploitable synergies like this to abuse, and pairing this with the leeway that the brave and default system offers leads to combat that continuously feels fresh as you find new ways to ‘break’ the game.</p>
<p>As a re-release of a decade-old game, both the best and worst part of Bravely Default HD is probably that not a whole lot has changed about it. Aside from things like the expected visual bumps and some cute new minigames that use the Switch 2’s mouse mode, this is almost exactly the same game that you could play on your 3DS all those years ago.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156826/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On one hand, it speaks to its timeless quality that there wasn’t a whole lot the developers felt they needed to change—it was a great game back then and it’s still a great game now. On the other, there’s a lingering feeling that more could’ve been done to make this remaster more of a definitive version, perhaps through the inclusion of something like the extra side story or epilogue Monolith Soft has added to its recent Xenoblade remasters.</p>
<p>Even so, those minigames <em>are</em> kind of cool, and they do a good job of demonstrating some of the Switch 2 mouse controls' possibilities. The first, Luxencheer Rhythm Catch, acts as a rhythm game in which you control two cursors (one in each hand) that you manoeuvre around the screen to catch beats as they pop up. The other one, Ringabel’s Panic Cruise, places you behind the complicated controls of the airship and challenges you to juggle multiple tasks as you steer the ship, repair occasional damage to various parts, and adjust things like the AC and radio according to party member requests.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156837/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both minigames reminded me a bit of the kind of side content that you’d find in most modern mainline Kirby games—they’re fun, bite-size distractions that offer up a nice palate cleanser from the base game. They clearly aren’t the main draw and there’s a rather limited amount of content to explore here, but they also have more depth than you may initially think and take a fair amount of time to master everything.</p>
<p>Plus, they aren’t <em>totally</em> isolated from the main game—although you can initially jump into the minigames from the title screen, progress in the campaign eventually leads to you unlocking new content in each one. And once you’ve passed a certain point in the story, your performance in these minigames is rewarded with currency you can use to buy special equipment and items.</p>
<p>Visually, Bravely Default HD does a modest job of updating the memorable visuals of the original, although this is hardly a <em>massive</em> overhaul. Everything runs at a smooth frame rate and the bite-sized worlds look great in HD, particularly the richly detailed, painterly look of many towns and dungeons. Yet it’s also clear that the same squat and simplistic character models from the original release were reused here, and they can look a bit basic when blown up on the big screen of even the Switch 2 handheld screen.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156817/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bravely Default HD isn't an ugly game, but it’s also far from a showcase of the added power of the new Switch 2, and we can’t help but wonder why a version of this remaster couldn’t have been produced for the original Switch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster is a solid update of one of Square’s finest modern turn-based RPGs. Its combination of a flexible job system, dynamic combat, and unexpectedly interesting story makes for an adventure that no fans of the JRPG genre will want to miss out on, especially any such fans that enjoyed Team Asano’s more recent work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> duology.</p>
<p>That in mind, there isn’t really anything <em>new</em> in this remaster that justifies the price of a double dip—if you already put a lot of time into this one on the 3DS back in the day, I’d caution you to first consider just how badly you want to spend your money on what ultimately amounts to little more than a nice visual bump. All the same, Bravely Default was and still is a great RPG; if you haven’t had the chance to give this one a shot yet, this port is a great way to see what the fuss is about.</p></section>

			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally is launching in a few months, but Microsoft reportedly has yet to commit to a price due to the uncertainty of the current economic situation.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/so-just-how-much-will-the-xbox-ally-cost-heres-what-we-know-so-far">Windows Central</a> corroborated the rumored October launch window for the two handhelds, clarifying they are tentatively slated for late October. According to the outlet's sources, however, the rumored prices of $499 for the base model and $799 for the premium model may not be accurate, as Microsoft has yet to commit to a price due to the tariffs imposed by the United States on products manufactured in countries such as China and Taiwan, where ASUS manufactures its products.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X were revealed earlier this month during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, following a few teases shared in the past few months. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which will deliver higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither model, however, will feature a superior<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/"> OLED display</a>, as ASUS had to balance adding the nowadays essential VRR support with power draw and costs, deeming an LCD panel an ultimately better choice.</p>

			<p>Xbox has just confirmed the next batch of Xbox Game Pass games being added into the service, with 11 more games joining across the rest of the month of June and into the very beginning of July.</p>
<p>That's 20 games added to the service this month alone, after Xbox announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-the-alters-ea-sports-fc-25-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-june/">at the start of June what players</a> would be getting for their Game Pass subscriptions. The news came through an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/17/xbox-game-pass-june-2025-wave-2/">Xbox Wire post</a>, which begins with the games we already knew were being added to the service that are live today, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, before going into what'll come throughout the rest of June.</p>
<p>Beginning this week and spanning through to July 1, Xbox Game Pass subscribers will be able to dive into Sloclap's new soccer game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">Rematch</a>, which is launching into the subscription service. Then, towards the end of next week, the first three Warcraft games will all make their way onto the service.

<p>There are even a few bits of DLC being added to the service, with Fallout 76's upcoming Gone Fission DLC, Minecraft's Chase the Skies DLC, and Dead by Daylight's Five Nights at Freddy's DLC, all added to the service today.</p>
<p>As is always the case, with new games being added to the service, others are being taken away. Here are the six games that will be leaving Game Pass on June 30:</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-ubisoft-and-creative-assembly-dev-reveals-4x-space-sim-stellar-reach.1220682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Ubisoft and Creative Assembly staffer James Miller has announced&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>, a 4X space sim from his new studio Stelleas, and it's due to arrive on PC this September.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Miller intends&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>to be "as rewarding for genre veterans as it is approachable for newcomers", which is a hard sell; this is, after all, a famously complex genre, but perhaps Miller can truly straddle the line.</p>

<p>Miller and Stelleas promise "classic 4X gameplay across a real-scale, fully 3D star-system map", so if you're a fan of the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stellaris" rel="nofollow">Stellaris</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sins-of-solar-empire-is-making-comeback-after-15-years" rel="nofollow"><em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em></a>, then you're probably going to dig this one as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=eckYfwOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=Nd4h-kbI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>aims to offer classic 4X space sim fun.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will feature eight different factions, and Miller says each of them will have "unique tech trees and strategic approaches". You can also look forward to three distinct victory paths: Supremacy, Prosperity, and Industrial Supremacy, which are all fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>There's also a "comprehensive research system" in the game, which will grant you access to six tech trees and shared technologies that enable "strategic synergy".</p>

<p>You'll be able to exploit 13 different resource types across&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>'s galaxy, and each will play "a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of your fleets, armies, and industries", according to Miller and Stelleas.</p>

<p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will also be taking place across "a fully 3D starfield", although whether or not that means the game will feature&nbsp;<em>Homeworld</em>-style Z-axis combat remains to be seen. I, for one, sure hope so.</p>




<p>It's fair to say the 4X space sim market isn't exactly barren; games like&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galactic Civilization</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Endless Space&nbsp;</em>remain hugely popular among their fanbases, so Miller and Stelleas have some work to do if they want to dominate this particular galaxy.</p>

<p>We'll get to find out whether he can achieve this goal when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2578670/Stellar_Reach/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, apparently sometime in September. Stay tuned for more.</p>

In a press release from the game’s publisher Raw Fury, it was announced that <em>Blue Prince</em> is getting an update that will add Mac support (via Steam) coming “later this year.” </p><div><p><em>Blue Prince</em> released earlier this year and quickly became an early GOTY candidate with folks (i.e. me) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro">drawing comparisons to the runaway hit <em>Balatro</em></a>. The game is kinda like <em>Brewster’s Millions</em> with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672746/blue-prince-more-major-update-1-10-patch">heaping helping of intricate puzzles to solve</a> and roguelite mechanics to keep you on your toes. </p></div><p>In it, your recently deceased uncle has given you the keys to his beloved Mt.

It’s a great game, and definitely well-suited to play sessions on a Macbook Air.</p><p>In addition to the new platform – which joins PC, PS5, and the Xbox Series X / S – starting today the game’s subtle but vibey soundtrack will be available for purchase on Steam.

            <p>If you wondered why it worth making such a fuss to save Super Earth from the Illuminate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> not too long ago, you might want to take a look at the game's latest Galactic War twist. A fresh major order has players embarking to cities that the squids have twisted in their image, and they're a sight to behold.</p>
<p>Urban warfare's the thing in the shooter at the moment, with the divers having just resisted a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">big bug invasion</a> of a bunch of cities. Now, they're dropping in to try and save innocent citizens that might already have been, uh, squidified.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1934972239130107927">the order's briefing</a>, it's been discovered that the Illuminate who survived the invasion's defeat have managed to take over two planets and transform their cities into places that look fit for a Xenomorph hen do. Alairt III and Alamak VII are the worlds in question.</p><p>As outlined in the order's briefing, 

</p><p>"Comparative topography confirms preliminary intel: our metropolises appear to have undergone unsanctioned re-engineering," the briefing says, "The fate of the millions trapped within these altered cityscapes is unknown. Their conversion into hostile biological assets is probable; they are considered compromised until proven otherwise."</p>
<p>Those trapped citizens seem to have been encased in the banks of pod-looking structures players who've already dropped in have found littering the place, often propped up in rows against the sides of ruined skyscrapers. Some folks also reckon they've run into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ldmds9/is_that_what_i_think_it_is/#lightbox">structures that resemble</a> the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_1:Objectives?file=Beacon.jpg">Illuminate beacons</a> from the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>.</p> 
<p>A nice easter egg if so, but also maybe a bit of foreshadowing that the squids have attempted to call in some  reinforcements following their failure to destroy or capture the Helldivers' home planet. One thing's for sure, while no new enemies have come with the first deployment of Illuminatified cities, it does seem like Arrowhead have gotten well and truly back into the swing of regularly finding interesting ways to switch things up on players.</p>
<p>There are a few complaints about things feeling a tad repetitive in the Reddit threads I've scanned, but they're few and far between. Environments that offer visually interesting twists have long been an ace up HD2's sleeve in terms of keeping things fresh between the big updates - hello, memed-to-death <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-robot-vietnam-melevelon-creek">Malevelon Creek</a> - so it's cool to see the devs leaning into that again.</p>
<p>It's also fitting to be fighting the Illuminate again after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">this morning's patch</a> added in a free cape that commemorates the last big victory over them. Just maybe don't put down your gun and use emotes to point that out while you're in Leviathan firing range.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>New York, New York, it’s a helluva town! The Bronx is up but the Battery's also up because they both run on anti-gravity now! Haha, oh my sides. Please excuse my very whimsical Broadway introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aether-and-iron">Aether &amp; Iron</a>, a sci-fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from an alternate 1930s in which New York has taken a turn for the Bioshock Infinite, soaring through the clouds care of fancy “aether” technology.</p>
<p>It’s inspired by art deco and 1930s detective comics, features a turn-based combat system involving getaway cars, and is the work of a team that includes former Ubisoft scribe Justin Cummings. Here’s a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In Aether &amp; Iron you play an offensively stylish smuggler who sports the kind of trenchcoat and fedora combination I dream of pulling off, but which typically makes me look as though I’ve gotten dressed at a themepark giftshop while escaping a flood. Using what appears to be a blend of ornate map screens, visual novel backdrops and workshop menus, you’ll recruit a crew and carry contraband while building up three core stats – Hustle, Smarts, and Brass.</p>
<p>“No matter how good you are always a dice roll away from success or failure,” the blurb cautions. I imagine they lose a lot of dice up there in giddy, free-floating New York. The city’s tabletop role-players must be an absolute plague on the people living beneath - imagine being killed by a D20 dropped from 10 miles up. But I digress.</p>
<p>In the course of making a tidy haul on the seedy side of the tracks, you will also have the opportunity to “rise as a savior, withdraw as a renegade, or evolve into a symbol of resilience in a world of authoritarian barons and high-stakes strategy”. Whichever route you pick, it sounds like there will be plenty of car chases. The game’s aether-powered roadsters can be outfitted with smoke dispensers, flame throwers, steel plates and grenade launchers. Going by the trailer above, the vehicular battles are grid-based with the quirk that the splitting of the road might divide one driver from the rest.</p>
<p>Aether &amp; Iron appeals to me partly because they’ve successfully rolled one of those D20s and conquered the urge to label it “aetherpunk”. Well done, developers Seismic Squirrel! That was a close one. I also quite enjoy the snippets I’ve caught of the writing from the trailer.

        <h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 +</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In the world of Gamindustri, four CPUs (also known as Goddesses) battled for supremacy in the War of the Guardians. One of the CPUs— Neptune—was defeated by the others and banished from the heavens. In her fall from grace, Neptune’s memories were lost, but a mysterious book revealed itself to her with knowledge of all of Gaminudstri’s history. Joined by Compa, IF, and the sentient book known as Histoire, Neptune embarks on an extraordinary journey across four different nations on a quest to save the entire world!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Goddesses are Back!</strong> – Previously available on PlayStation Vita in North America, now you can immerse yourself in the zany <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,682 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> madness for the first time on PlayStation 4!</li><li><strong>Revisit Classic Neptunia <a title="Genres > RPG [17,371 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Style Battles</strong> – Battle with up to three characters on the field, with 3 more as support. Use them to perform special attacks or swap them out at any time!</li><li><strong>Switch it Up with Plans</strong> – Use Plans to customize the game by changing up enemy difficulty, dungeon treasures, and more!</li><li><strong>Gear Galore</strong> – Craft unique equipment imbued with one or more abilities!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>20XX. Gamindustri faces a dire crisis! Ever since the advent of ASIC—the Arfoire Syndicate of International <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>e—morality has all but vanished. As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you—you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase / decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989. Neptune’s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late ’80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough—except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ’80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The realtime mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends! Each is equipped with special skills that lend their support to Stella in her items quest, so choose wisely!</li><li><strong>Remake in Your Image!</strong> – Modify the world of Gamindustri to your liking by creating “Plans” that alter dungeon treasures, enemy difficulty, and more!</li><li><strong>Get Crafty!</strong> – Customize powerful equipment that can unlock the true power of the CPUs, unlocking a world of new skills for them to use!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Pokemon Go is now owned by Scopely, which itself is owned by Saudi Arabia-owned Savvy Games. What's the day-to-day impact on Pokemon Go based on its new ownership? Not much, according to Pokemon Go's game director.</p><p>Michael Steranka told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that he understands why people are skeptical. After all, there are countless examples of a new owner coming in and making major changes.</p><p>"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical," Steranka said. "The biggest thing that we can do is just prove over time that this actually is a great direction for the game to go. But I do think that... I've definitely seen people have a little bit more optimism for the future. It's healthy skepticism, but optimistic, regardless."</p><p>Niantic sold its games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion, and this was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4718">No. 8 most-expensive video game acquisition in history.</a></p><p>Steranka also clarified that the Pokemon Go development team will "pretty much never" engage directly with the bosses at Savvy. He said it's his understanding that Savvy allows Scopely to "operate the way they want to operate."</p><p>The director went on to say he's excited by the fact that Scopely is 100% a video game company, whereas Niantic had projects in the works across multiple content categories. "That's where I feel like we did struggle a little bit over on the Niantic side," he said. "It's just when it comes to overall company priorities, and where do we want to invest, and what sort of company initiatives we're pushing forward at Scopely, it'll be very much focused on what's best for this game. And I think that'll be a nice breath of fresh air for everybody."</p><p>In terms of what fans can expect from Pokemon Go in the future under its new ownership, Steranka said the team plans to pull back from AR initiatives for the game. He said it's no secret that players "have not been super excited about some of the AR systems" in the game. In the future, Steranka said fans can only expect new AR features if it's something the team believes in fully and could be something "exciting."</p><p>"Scopely hasn't come in and said, 'Hey, don't do that.' They've very much come in and been very supportive of all the things that we had already been planning on the roadmap," he said. "We've got a couple other amazing features and updates coming down the line later this year that players will be equally thrilled to see."</p><p>Scopely is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">working with The Witcher studio CD Projekt on a new game.</a></p>

The writer behind<em> Final Fantasy XVI</em> decided to push forward with bringing back <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> after replaying it 2018 on a livestream for the first time since it released in 1997. </p><p>A lack of rigorous documentation procedures at the time made it hard, however. Back in the PS1 days, games were made quickly and once they shipped the company moved on. The Japanese version might be completely overwritten in English for the international release. As a result, the current Square Enix team had to cobble together the new enhanced <em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>version through “sheer force.”</p><p>“We analyzed a number of existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming of the original, but there were also times where we played the original game and worked it out by feel alone,” Maehiro said. The entire process was the result of cumulative hard work—on the one hand working to implement new features, while behind the scenes our work was similar to porting an old arcade game to the NES.”</p><p><em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>includes updated graphics (read: HD smoothing), voice acting, a re-edited script, and quality-of-life features like fast-forward and save anywhere. The original version of the game is also playable. But this isn’t the first time Square Enix has ported <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. The <em>War of the Lions</em> version was released for PlayStation Portable in 2007, alongside a Shakespeare-ified script, some additional cutscenes, new job classes, and a wireless multiplayer mode. Surprisingly, none of that new content will be in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>. </p><p>“We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in War of the Lions<em>,” </em>Maehiro said. “However, the original version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.”</p><p>The director notes that the<em> War of the Lions</em> port was handled by a different team than the original game, and he suggests that having gotten some of the original game’s veterans back together—including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-yasumi-matsuno-political-1851783744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-yasumi-matsuno-political-1851783744">original writer and director Yasumi Matsuno</a></span>—the team wanted to stay as close to the original as possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Famitsu</a></span>, there’s also a mention of how poorly optimized the PSP version was, with audio bugs and frame rate crashes. While I can respect that, it also feels like a huge missed opportunity to expand on one of the best tactical RPG sandboxes in the genre. </p><p>That could have meant adding new jobs for players to explore or new modes. Online multiplayer, a roguelite mode, or some other end-game content feels like an obvious addition to one of the best games ever made. Fortunately, it does sound like three new difficulty options in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> will rebalance some of the gameplay. Once you’ve mastered <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ job system, it can make even its toughest battles feel trivially easy. A new tactical mode will add a new level of challenge, while some abilities that were useless in the original, like archer charging attacks, have been fixed in the standard difficulty. Another neat addition?

Preorders just dropped on Amazon, which are conveniently found below because I'm an absolute legend like that. Speaking of Switch 2, I've included a solid deal on the best-selling TomToc slim carrying case to protect that hefty chunk of change.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store only has a stunning Master Sword replica in stock too, complete with its scabbard and a sleek display stand. Unfortunately, you won't be able to destroy anything with it as it's not a real sword, but it's a cracking collectible to have above the fireplace or on your back consistently. Moving onto today's tech deals, I've found a banging deal on one of the best gaming monitors at the moment, Samsung 57"Odyssey Neo G9 and a bag full of Apple Mac and iPad discounts. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.</p><p id="donkey-kong-bananza"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Donkey Kong Bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223102"><div id="223102" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-donkey-kong-bananza-direct-for-this-week">Nintendo Direct dropping for Donkey Kong Bananza</a> tommorow, it's a good time to make sure you've got the Mario Odyssey-esque 3D platformer secured for day one.

A cinematic cut of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to debut at a film festival next month.</p><p>The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Cinematic Cut will get its premiere screening on July 9 during the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic. The announcement (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-cinematic-cut-kviff-premiere-1236291931/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>) doesn't say how long the cinematic cut will be, but it will follow the narrative of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who sets out to avenge his family and protect Sir Hans Capon during a diplomatic mission gone wrong.</p><p>Daniel Vávra and Petr Pekař are both credited as the director of the cinematic cut. Vávra wrote and directed both Kingdom Come games, while Pekar is Warhorse's cinematic director and led the team of animators who created five hours of cutscenes for the sequel. It's unclear if Warhorse Studios intends to screen the cinematic cut outside of the film festival, but CEO Martin Frývadlský expressed his eagerness to see the game's story get its due.</p><p>"I have wished to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on the big screen for a long time," said Frývadlský in a statement. "I believe that the civil story of a blacksmith’s son will also appeal to film audiences and stand up to the competition of international movie productions.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is getting a <em>third</em> official Lego mode on Wednesday, in the form of Lego Fortnite <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/squad-up-and-save-the-day-in-lego-fortnite-expeditions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Expeditions</a>, a four-player co-op mode that allows players to team up on a variety of action-adventure missions. For those Lego fans who have asked for a Lego Fortnite mode that recalls the many different story-based Lego adventure games, like Lego Star Wars, Expeditions is the one you've been waiting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOPVQSHIic" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lego Fortnite Expeditions is the first official Lego mode in Epic's metaverse that doesn't involve building stuff--the purpose of this game is to battle enemies and solve puzzles alongside your friends. But don't worry--you won't be stuck using only the same sorts of weapons and items you can find in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, because Expeditions has character classes with unique abilities that you can upgrade as you complete missions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the three classes–Hunter, Shadow Caller, and Rift Ripper--has its own unique main power and movement ability. The Rift Ripper, for example, can use rifts to get high ground or travel, or to drop crystal on the heads of baddies, while the Hunter can mark and make enemies more vulnerable to damage with its Bulls-eye Blade. If you wanna get weird, try out the Shadow Caller class, which can turn into a flock of ravens in an instant to escape any bad situation.</p><p dir="ltr">When Expeditions launches on Wednesday, it'll be accessible both as its own mode in the Discover page in the lobby, and by visiting a battle bus location in Lego Fortnite Odyssey or Lego Fortnite Brick Life. Odyssey, Lego's sandbox crafting mode, will also experience some bleedthrough from Expeditions, as new baddies introduced in the mode will start invading Odyssey islands in July sometime.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Expeditions is just one of several parts of the massive June 18 update, which almost feels big enough to be a new season update by this point. In addition to Expeditions, this update will begin a new season of Fortnite Festival with a brand-new headlining artist, launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-getting-yet-another-new-battle-royale-mode/1100-6532468/" data-ref-id="1100-6532468">the new Blitz Royale mode</a>, and see Ballistic expand with another new map.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">I was always a bit more of an outlier on the playground back in the day, preferring tales of destined children contending with trauma alongside digital monsters than everyday pre-teens leaving home to collect pocket monsters. Years later, Digimon still has my heart in a way Pokemon never will. The one area of the two respective franchises where I've enjoyed Pokemon more than Digimon is the video games. But I continue to hold out hope, dreaming of a Digimon video game that can rival how much I enjoy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-diamond-pearl-platinum-version/" data-ref-id="5000-35035">Pokemon Platinum</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-alpha-sapphire-omega-ruby/" data-ref-id="5000-272937">Omega Ruby</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus/" data-ref-id="5000-527659">Legends: Arceus</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Scarlet</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still not sure if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" data-ref-id="5000-663007">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a> is that game. The latest in the Digimon Story series, you play as a secret agent in Tokyo, Japan who witnesses a city-leveling disaster and then suddenly travels eight years into the past. With your knowledge of what's to come, you have to investigate the mystery surrounding the coming disaster. Your actions twist the world and reshape history, plunging you and your allies through alternate timelines. Your investigation also leads into the Digital World, a parallel reality where Digimon live--you can befriend and train these digital monsters as partners to use while in conflict with Digimon that mean you harm.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRCH0qPHYzo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JRCH0qPHYzo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As you might have surmised given the name, the Digimon Story series has regularly told their stories very well--the focus of the series has been to submerge the player in narrative-rich experiences. Gameplay has been the part of this series that can be very hit-or-miss, and I'm not sure Time Stranger bucks that trend.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't get to play too much of Time Stranger at Summer Game Fest--about 20 minutes in total. After exploring a hub-like area and seeing various Digimon (including a fun Digimon Adventure 02 easter egg of Veemon, Hawkmon, Armadillomon, and Wormmon hanging out together), I played through two fights: a quick bout against a bunch of smaller Digimon, and then the first few turns of a boss battle against Parrotmon. Time Stranger's turn-based combat is built on a Rock, Paper, Scissors framework--certain digital monsters resist attacks of specific types, and are weak to other types.</p><p dir="ltr">Time Stranger uses the franchise's long-used Data, Vaccine, Virus format, in which Virus corrupts Data, Data rewrites Vaccine, and Vaccine cures Virus. A Digimon of a specific type tends to mostly learn moves of that type, but stronger ones can learn from at least two different types to help cover for weaknesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515277"></a><figcaption>Combat is turn-based.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's pretty straightforward to pick up. Whenever a new Digimon shows up, there's some detective work needed on the player's part to figure out whether you're dealing with a Data, Vaccine, or Virus type, but simple experimentation with a variety of moves will reveal the result. It's not very hard, especially with only three options.</p><p dir="ltr">The potential issue I see is that, to make this dynamic more challenging, Time Stranger seems to have opted for making opponents have very large health bars. After playing through one round of combat against Parrotmon, I had deduced its type and which of my Digimon were best suited to fighting it--I switched out my Virus team members who would take extra damage from Parrotmon's Vaccine attacks, and directed my Data allies to leap into the fray. For the next three rounds, I pumped the same super-effective attacks into Parrotmon over and over. But even though my attacks were doing massive damage and Parrotmon's attacks were reduced to negligible numbers, I was only knocking off a tiny chunk of the boss's health bar each round. After the four rounds I played, Parrotmon still had over three-quarters of its health, and no new enemy had shown up, meaning the only thing left to do was keep clicking on my tried-and-true strategy for several more turns.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515278"></a><figcaption>The hub space in the Digital World is so cool!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Had I kept playing, I imagine the initial thrill of strategically reacting to Parrotmon's type and implementing a winning strategy would have dulled into tedium as I needed to keep chipping away at the giant parrot with the same moves over and over. There's no way to know for sure that would have happened, as my hands-on time with the demo ended there, and I didn't see what happened next, but that grind isn't appealing. It tries to create difficulty by making a boss fight longer than a traditional fight, not by making it more complex and incentivizing you to think about what move to use next.</p><p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing issue with Digimon games for years--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/digimon-survive-review-digital-devolution/1900-6417936/">I actually expressed similar complaints with Digimon Survive</a> back in 2022, which made fights "more difficult" by making each subsequent encounter last longer and longer. It did include one of the two non-standard Digimon types, Free, but that all-resistant type just made certain fights last even longer. I would have much preferred Variable/Hybrid boss battles--Digimon that change their type mid-fight, forcing an opponent to adjust their strategy on the fly. With that, Survive might have been more than another Digimon game with a great story and okay gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515279"></a><figcaption>Digimon of many forms and levels can be recruited, even non-traditional options like BeelStarmon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much in the way Survive immediately pulled me in with its likable characters and kept wowing me with its timey-whimey narrative, what I've seen so far of Time Stranger's story is intriguing. Like past Digimon games, I think that's where the game is going to excel. I loved exploring the hub area in the early part of the demo and seeing Digimon use their traditionally violent powers for everyday tasks, like Zudomon wielding its lightning-generating hammer to build tools as a blacksmith. The culture of the Digital World has never been a huge part of any of the games or anime, so having a hub that delves into that sounds exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">I left the demo of Time Stranger once again wishing for a Digimon game that would just be a visual novel. That said, I feel like I haven't had a chance to give Time Stranger's combat a fair shake--I only played one minor fight and part of a single boss fight. I was told that the two fights I played will occur about midway through the story, so it stands to reason that they're a fairly accurate representation of what combat will be like throughout Time Stranger. But it was a demo, and other fights might be wildly different. Heck, if other fights at least see you face off against multiple Digimon of various types, I think the game could deliver a decently strategic gameplay experience. That's just not what I saw at Summer Game Fest.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't have long to wait and see what the final game will be like. Digimon Story: Time Stranger is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on October 3.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> Expeditions' existence isn't much of a mystery given all the teasing Epic's been giving it on social media recently, but the teasing has now made way for a full reveal. And what is it? Expeditions, it turns out, is a mission-based PvE mode where players join forces to thwart the nefarious plans of an evil mask maker. As for the when, it's out this week.
</p>
<p>
Those wishing to embark on an Expeditions adventure will be enrolled in the Supernova Academy, where they'll hang out with other players, chat with members of the faculty (including founder Vengeance Jones), and take on co-op missions pitting them against Mask Maker Daigo's minions - which include sentient crystals, demon guards, and formidable Titans.
</p>
<p>
These missions whisk players (and as many as three friends) to key locations around the world map, including Utopia City, Spire Excavation Site, and Busted Bridge, with more - such as Demon's Domain, where Daigo resides - coming after launch. As for what you'll be doing out in the field, there's talk of rescuing civilians, setting up comm relays, and deploying field generators, all while fending off waves of enemies - and if players can find moment to explore amid the chaos, they might uncover useful resources, currency, gear, and more.

<p>
To aid in their adventures, players can switch between three distinct classes at will, each with their own XP-based skills trees. Shadow Caller, for instance, can summon projectiles that heal or deal damage; The Hunter is all about inflicting massive damage to a single target, while Rift Rippers can use their rift abilities against either single or multiple foes. Players can also randomly acquire gadgets and weapons - including Plasma Pistols, Dual Daggers, and the War Hammer - by spending Essence found during missions back at the academy.
</p>
<p>
As missions are completed, they'll contribute to global goals known as Team Projects, and Epic also mentions Academy Assignments, additional objectives players can pick up from faculty members and tackle during their downtime.
</p>
<p>
Lego Fortnite Expeditions comes to all versions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on 18th June, and can be accessed via the Battle Bus in either Odyssey or Brick Life modes. Additionally, Expeditions monsters will begin infiltrating Odyssey in July (hero classes will follow, according to Epic), and players can start crafting Expeditions weapons in preparation soon.

			<p>Rob Wiethoff, the actor who plays John Marston in Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2, teased in a <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1934015849603453002">live stream this past Saturday</a> while playing Red Dead Redemption, that there's 'something' coming this week related to the Red Dead series, likely closer to Friday, that he is incredibly excited to share and discuss with players, once the news is made public.</p>
<p>"<em>I've got such exciting news. I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely killing</em> <em>me</em>," he began. "<em>By the end of this week, hopefully sooner. Not this week, I guess. Probably, not as soon as tomorrow, but definitely before Friday. Oh my goodness, the news that I have to share - and I won't be the only one sharing it. I cannot wait for you to know what's going on. And that's all I can say.</em>"</p>
<p>What made it seem like a direct reference to Red Dead and a Red Dead-related announcement coming is that he ended his vague and excited statement by saying "<em>I'm so excited, but I truly cannot think of anything else, especially playing this game, I can't think of anything else.</em>"</p>
<p>Adding to Wiethoff's vague statements after the live stream was Roger Clark, the actor who plays Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2. When asked if he knew what Wiethoff was talking about on X, <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934308877446660381">he replied with a simple "<em>Yes,</em>"</a> and a gif of a grinning dog, smiling like they have a secret no one else knows.</p>
<p>Then, Noshir Dalal, the voice actor for Charles in Red Dead Redemption 2, <a href="https://x.com/NoshirDalal/status/1934390960332378568">replied to Clark's tweet with his own vague tease,</a> adding even more weight to the pile.</p>
<p>It's possible that all three actors are hinting that we'll finally get the reveal of the long-awaited current-gen update for Red Dead Redemption 2, a game that originally launched on PS4 and Xbox One, and is still without a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version. Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-enhanced-ambient-occlusion-trailer-quality/">even better with certain mods,</a> but console players are still left playing the last-gen version. A PS5 and Series X/S version would be a huge announcement for fans of the series.</p>
<p>And now that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-better-lighting-shadows-comparison/">first Red Dead game has a remastered</a> and graphically upgraded version, it's high time the sequel gets its due.</p>
<p>It could also be that Rockstar is about to add another game to the Nintendo Switch 2 lineup, with a Switch 2 version of RDR2 coming. It could also be that the game is coming to Switch 2, and it's getting a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version with graphical upgrades.</p>
<p>Or it's none of them, and instead we're getting some sort of Red Dead adaptation or just something else entirely. Who knows at this point, but you have to imagine that Wiethoff and company wouldn't get players riled up if there wasn't something big behind it. Just weeks ago, we saw voice actors from the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/">Persona 4 cast make subtle hints</a> in the lead-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-revival-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-new-trailer/">Persona 4 Revival's</a> reveal. Hopefully, these teases are leading towards a similar level of announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tron-catalyst-review-rocky-revolution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following up on 2023's visual novel&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-bithell-talks-about-his-dream-star-trek-game" rel="nofollow">Bithell Games</a>' sophomore outing with the franchise. In this more ambitious game, the team delivers a more direct experience, complete with the action fans expect, with both disc-to-disc combat and light cycle riding. However, this broadening of focus makes it much different than its predecessor-- for better and worse.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - A New Identity</h2>



<p>The biggest change from the previous&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>game to this one is the shift from a relatively hands-off visual novel to a more isometric action-oriented approach. This was a change that I felt would really benefit the game. I really enjoyed my time with&nbsp;<em>Identity</em>, but it was hard to push how fun riding a light cycle would be out of my mind.</p>

<p>Luckily,&nbsp;<em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>delivers the power fantasy that&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>fans would want, from disc-to-disc combat to light cycle riding. Unfortunately, the delivery of this new direction is one of the weaker parts of the game. Watching the game seems like it would deliver, but the reality was a little more clunky.</p>

<p>The bulk of the combat revolves around attacking with one button, and a parry and dodge. There are some additional techniques that unlock as well. The most fun ends up being throwing your disc, which can bounce between enemies and even yourself as it upgrades.</p>

<p>The one button that you end up needing, though, is the parry button. As you upgrade the skill tree, this parry becomes far too overtuned. While playing on the hardest difficulty, I managed to defeat the final boss with a single parry. To have any challenge, it felt like I had to purposely fight with one hand behind my back.</p>

<p>In addition to combat on Exo's feet, she utilizes her light cycle. One of the most iconic parts of the&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>mythos, the light cycle delivers on what you would want from it. It can feel a little clunky to use in crowded streets, but it shines in open areas. Derezzing enemies with its ribbon was one of the most fun things to do during my time in the Grid.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - Grid Greatness</h2>



<p>Speaking of the Grid, the world of it is the most compelling part of the game. After proving itself with its isolated Repository area in&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>, Bithell Games has created a fully realized Grid that feels right at home in the franchise.</p>

<p>The characters that populate the Grid are a bit part of this. Exo herself is compelling enough, but the real standout for me was Conn, one of the antagonists in the game. Seeing him develop was one of my main motivators for continuing to see the story through.</p>

<p>The Automata faction's return was another highlight of this iteration of the Grid. The way they challenge the status quo of the world in&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is one I found myself invested in. It helps that their pink and white color scheme absolutely shines in the world.</p>

<p>One of the lacking parts of the world was its exploration aspects. It's always easy to find where you're going, but I never felt the motivation to explore the previous areas with new abilities as I got them. These paths mostly only led to skill points, which I felt&nbsp;<em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>was already incredibly generous with.</p>

<h2>TRON: Catalyst - Glitching Pains</h2>



<p>One of the biggest gripes that developed for me as I played was the Glitch, a mechanic introduced that allows Exo to repeat a cycle to make different decisions. The thought of this system excited me, as the branching paths of&nbsp;<em>Identity&nbsp;</em>were arguably its strongest suit.</p>

<p>This looping, unfortunately, ended up being mostly a letdown. While it gets a little more open later on, it begins feeling like a chore to extend certain sections.</p>

<p>In addition, going back to change certain decisions was fun, but almost never seemed to have the sort of butterfly effect that I wanted. I repeated decisions with a character to try and help them the best I could, only to never have a meaningful interaction with them again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was also plagued by actual glitches alongside the Glitch mechanic. Frequently, when throwing my disc, it could get stuck, especially on narrow paths. This inconsistency ended up leading me right back to that powerful parry, just to get through the combat, instead of getting more creative.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is a largely uneven experience. It has some great highs, especially in the worldbuilding and story departments. However, the gameplay can be largely uneven and even frustrating at times. Tron fans are sure to have a lot of fun with the story and even the gameplay, despite my hangups.</p>

<p>With this and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army" rel="nofollow">Strange Scaffold's <em>Ninja Turtles</em> game</a>, it's been fun to see IP owners loosen the grip on certain franchises. Despite my complaints, I do really hope that Bithell Games gets to finish what seems to be a planned trilogy of games. The bones of a great game are here. I would love to see where this story goes and ends. I just hope that the journey to find that answer is a lot more fun next time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battle Train Review - Fear of Flying]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying.1220562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An unsung guilty pleasure of mine is the secret stress test known as <em>Train Valley</em>. A jaunty little jog through the legacy of locomotives that quickly becomes the most intense experience you’ll have next to open heart surgery. Sometimes, however, a more direct approach is required, which is why <em>Battle Train</em> is here to dismantle all this complexity of train travel.</p>

<p>This is the latest release from Terrible Posture Games, a rather underseen developer in the grand scheme of things, with titles like <em>Tower of Guns</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mothergunship-review-fire-and-forget" rel="nofollow"><em>MOTHERGUNSHIP</em></a> under their belt. After a successful Kickstarter campaign to start things off, <em>Battle Train</em> sees Terrible Posture still scratching that roguelite itch, with help from co-developers Nerd Ninjas – who’ve helped Niantic out with their AR titles <em>Peridot Beyond</em> and <em>Pokemon Go</em> – and publishing help from none other than Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>You play as a contestant on the show viewed by “10 billion people” (the figures are real, trust), Battle Train, a <em>Takeshi’s Castle</em>-esque game show filled with explosions, a lively host, and a worthy final villain in the form of Supreme President Conductor Aalvado. Through the framing device of a fly-on-the-wall documentary detailing inner turmoil and office politics, you’ll slowly uncover a web of network shenanigans, celebrity ego, and image sacrificed for ratings… while also smashing trains into each other.</p>



<p>There’s a lot going on here, from the narrative which is implemented into story events you can run into on the world map, to the fusion of deck-building roguelite and board game. It’s easy to consider it blind ambition, or blind anything, since everything is on-the-spot; who your opponent is, what events you’ll run into, etc. There's not a lot of prediction in <em>Battle Train</em>, only the next stop, which may be your last.</p>

<p>Gameplay consists of you and your opponent taking turns on a board to build tracks into each other's outposts, so you can slam trains from your base into them for damage. There are energy deposits in the form of scattered minerals and mines placed on the map, so you have to balance between wanting your opponent to lose and generating an economy to realize that objective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another rule is that both you and your opponent should be able to use the same tracks, should they both connect to your stations, something which is just as prosperous as it is dangerous. Place a few obstacle generation cards and alternative methods of damage, and you should have a charismatic mix of chess by way of <em>Under Siege 2</em>, right?</p>



<p>Almost, but not quite. Since it’s a deck builder, there’s still a lot in the way of the type of build you can, could, and <em>should </em>generate, as well as prospects in the form of upgrading your train. Extra minerals, extra gold, more health, etc. – it all takes further priority than what you want your deck to achieve. Regardless of which direction you take, there will be certain patches of dead air in battle where you and your opponent will simply end turns until you can accrue the cards you need.</p>

<p>Indeed, a lot of the train upgrades are where you’ll find your muscle in battle, leading to some exceptionally one-sided affairs of runs. That isn’t to say that <em>Battle Train</em> can’t generate some exciting and tense battles later down the line, once you unlock more cards, upgrades, and understanding of your fairly small but varied roster of opponents. As it stands, though, a fat handful of your victories will lie in whether or not you can summon a lucky enough upgrade in the initial stretch.</p>

<p>A disappointing prospect to consider, especially when fighting tooth and nail to survive, is where <em>Battle Train</em> absolutely shines. Find yourself down and out, one hit away from death, and turn meek retreat into a cartridge trap of sudden connections to your enemy outposts, as your railway starts connecting to theirs, and now there’s a long train comin’. It’s a rare sight, but when tactical fortitude is what wins you a run in <em>Battle Train</em>, you will not stop beaming for a while after the run.</p>



<p>Also, in a rather deflating decision, there’s no PvP element for you to face your friends… what gives? In its peaks, <em>Battle Train</em> absolutely taps into the same vein of silliness and teeth-clenching moments that something like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/worms-wmd-review-worm-has-returned" rel="nofollow">Worms</a> </em>would provide, so it’s disappointing to see that, eventually, you will run into a brick wall in terms of what <em>Battle Train</em> can provide for you.</p>

<p>Part of me believes Terrible Posture are aware of this, which is why they put all their chips on providing a rather hefty narrative to go alongside the gameplay, a brave decision for a roguelite. You could ignore it entirely, but you’d be remiss of a rather delicate writing affair that’s trying to juggle childish endeavors with an almost adult flavor. It’s not some secret genius theory like, I dunno, “The Sinister Undertones of <em>Bluey</em>” or what-have-you, it’s more that <em>Battle Train</em> wants to convince you of its writing chops.</p>

<p>It certainly convinced me. Every time it got a bit too cynical or saccharine to deal with, it turned right back around into being absorbing, if not charismatic. This is thanks to some well-done characterization in the form of Aalvado, and the stupidly adorable Todrick the Turtle, as well as knowing when and where to let a joke lie. Even with a lacking cast, <em>Battle Train</em> grows a lot from a little, and it was worth it to play the game just to see the next cutscene, which feels weird to say, right?</p>

<p>Still, that’s my opinion, and not everyone wants the promise of smashing trains into buildings to be uprooted by <em>30 Rock</em> meets <em>The Crystal Maze</em>. You can still go through <em>Battle Train</em> and completely ignore the story it presents, but it’s there to consider why, at times, the gameplay and its mechanical opportunities might feel blunt, or even stodgy. Is it still fun? Absolutely, but this isn’t chess we’re talking about here. Not even checkers… tiddlywinks, maybe.</p>



<h2><em>Battle Train&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>When it works, <em>Battle Train</em> is ingenious, sharp, and oddly alluring with the twists and turns it presents, and when it doesn’t work, you still have what is essentially an outrageously silly board game. It’s not got the depth to match your favorites, but it has the passion, the charm, and the wits to know it’s better to go for broke with a blunderbuss. I certainly know one thing, though.</p>

<p>This is a no-Todrick-slander zone from now on.</p>
