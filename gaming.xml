  <p id="tSSzIb">Roll the phrase around your tongue with me: Starmetal sword. <em>Starmetal sword</em>. The lost secret to Damascus steel could totally have been meteorites! Attila the Hun had a sword like this, right? Or Excalibur was one, yeah? Tutankhamun was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun%27s_meteoric_iron_dagger">definitely buried with one</a>. <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>’s heroine has a starmetal sword, and so does Sokka in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, and the Redwall series practically revolves around whoever’s got the meteorite-forged sword of Martin the Warrior in their paws. </p>

<p id="dbzq1z">Man, starmetal swords are cool. Until you actually look them up in real life. </p>
<p id="gmidxp">Would it surprise you to know that there’s no material advantage you can forge into a sword using metal from a meteorite? Eh, probably not, you’re smart and skeptical, so you know that while the iron-nickel alloys in meteorites have distinctively different traces of other elements than those found in Earth’s own iron ore, none of those meteorite elements are regularly found in any quantities that would affect the properties of a forged object. </p>
<p id="r0tN5x">Tutankhamun’s meteorite dagger was exceptional in materials, not in capabilities. Excalibur isn’t real. Attila’s “sword of Mars” was folklore. Also, we’ve developed some really solid ideas of how Damascus steel was made, and none of them involve metal from space. </p>
<p id="GGzi4y">Starmetal swords are just normal swords. </p>
<h2 id="3Qeg1v"><strong>But are they really?</strong></h2>

<p id="kXZbsW">Of <em>course not</em>. They’re made with <em>metal</em> from <em>space</em>! And every list of starmetal swords that were no sharper, harder, or hardier than their earthly counterparts is also a list of human yearning — yearning to connect an earthly tool, and therefore its wielder, to the celestial realm. </p>
<p id="cu9r7e">And you don’t even have to go as far afield as heaven. The earliest known prehistoric iron objects are made from meteoric iron. Before we developed the techniques that could refine iron ore into usable metal, we made things out of iron from space. A starmetal sword doesn’t have to connect you to the sky when it can connect you to the origins of ironworking on this planet. </p>

<p id="x9D0Ys">And nobody knew that better than satirist Terry Pratchett. Upon being knighted in 2009, Sir Terry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/feb/22/10">told the Guardian</a>, “You can’t ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I’d get myself a horse and a sword.” </p>
<p id="bMHzC7">A year later, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425013731/http://www.news.com.au/technology/terry-pratchett-creates-a-sword-with-meteorites/story-e6frfro0-1225926584339">did just that</a> (OK, not the horse part). He gathered iron ore from surface deposits near his England home, smelted and hammered it into bars with a handmade clay forge, and delivered the bars to a blacksmith to have them worked into his own sword, finished with silver. And he tossed pieces of meteorite into the fires of that forge as well, telling <a href="http://news.com.au/">News.com.au</a>, “Thunderbolt iron, you see — highly magical, you’ve got to chuck that stuff in whether you believe in it or not.” </p>
<p id="EQSOR3">In one of the most famous passages Pratchett ever wrote, he opined on the value of casual belief. In his characteristic silly and profound, satirist manner, a scene in the novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hogfather-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061059056?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hogfather-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061059056?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23925102__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925102__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Hogfather</em></a> features the figure of the Grim Reaper telling his adopted granddaughter that human beings have to believe in little things without hard evidence, like Santa Claus — and swords made of stars. </p>
<p id="CwbUHf">They had to, so that they could believe in the big things without hard evidence, like justice, and hope. </p>
<p id="o8Y3iY">So if it’s all the same to you, I’m going to keep believing that starmetal swords are cool. Terry Pratchett thought they were. </p>

Here are ten great <em>X-Men</em> comics to try out if you loved <em>X-Men ‘97</em>.</p><h2 id="h9083"><a id=""></a><strong>The crash course: <em>Grand Design</em></strong></h2><p>Is <em>X-Men ‘97</em> your first foray into the world of Marvel’s Mutants? Are you looking to learn more about the decades of history behind the characters? Well, then <em>X-Men: Grand Design</em> is for you. The six-issue series from creator Ed Piskor is made precisely to act as a crash course in the <em>X-Men</em>. Beginning in the ‘60s and going all the way into the ‘90s, <em>Grand Design</em> is a streamlined greatest-hits story chronicling the entire history of the <em>X-Men</em>. Instead of reading hundreds of issues, you can read just six and get a pretty good idea of who the major players in the world are and what their deal is. From there you can pick out specific eras you want to go back and dive deeper into. </p><figure id="" data-id="9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-recommend-id="image://9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1264" data-height="711" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-recommend-id="image://9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1264" data-height="711" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h9084"><a id=""></a><strong>The beginning (but better): <em>First Class </em>and<em> Season One</em></strong></h2><p>Now if you want to get acquainted with the <em>X-Men </em>starting from the very beginning in a more in-depth manner than <em>Grand Design</em>, you have a couple of options. Yes, you could read the original run of <em>X-Men</em> but it isn’t very good. What you can do instead is read either <em>X-Men: First Class</em> or <em>X-Men: Season One</em>. Both are modern retellings of the adventures of the original five team members in their teenage years. I personally lean toward <em>Season One</em> as I think it still captures some of the retro campiness of the original while modernizing the story and art for current readers. If you want, though, you can read both; there is some narrative overlapping but they’re different enough to keep you interested.</p><h2 id="h9085"><a id=""></a><strong>More of the same: <em>X-Men ‘92</em></strong></h2><p>Maybe you don’t care enough about the origins and history of the X-Men to fully fling yourself into the wild world of the comics, and you really just want more stories featuring the animated series’ cast while you wait for season 2. That’s fair. In that case, I recommend trying out <em>X-Men ‘92</em>. This limited series takes place in the universe of the animated series and tells an interesting meta-story about censorship using the villain Cassandra Nova. It’s a fun read that isn’t bogged down too hard with decades of stories before it. Also, it might be an inspiration for the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a></span>, so that’s two birds with one stone for you.</p><h2 id="h9086"><a id=""></a><strong>Reading ahead: <em>Onslaught</em> and <em>Age of Apocalypse</em></strong></h2><p>Season one of <em>X-Men ‘97</em> ended on a pretty big cliffhanger that teased some major storylines for next season. You could wait for the show to get around to those, <em>or</em> you could just read ahead! Based on the season finale, which saw the team separated across time and space and encountering a certain big blue baddie, it seems clear that the seminal<em> Age of Apocalypse</em> will have a major influence. The classic story saw an alternate future ruled by the villain Apocalypse and an X-Men team led by Magneto. You could also read <em>Onslaught</em>, which precedes <em>Age of Apocalypse</em> and deals with the relationship between Charles and Magneto. Season one drew on many iconic storylines, like the Trial of Magneto, but tweaked them in interesting ways, so if you do read these two comics, don’t expect season two to exactly follow the blueprint they lay out, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-recommend-id="image://ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1659" data-height="933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-recommend-id="image://ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1659" data-height="933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h9087"><a id=""></a><strong>A self-contained oddball: <em>Worst X-Man Ever</em></strong></h2><p>Not every mutant is created equal. That’s the premise of the wonderfully absurd <em>Worst X-Man Ever</em>. While most of Marvel’s mutants are beefcakes with cool powers, protagonist Bailey Hoskins is a wimpy kid who has the ability to blow his entire body up…. once. He doesn’t have regenerative powers or immortality, so he would just… die. The book takes that premise and runs with it for five incredible issues that become an interesting investigation of what it means to be a mutant and a hero in the Marvel Comics universe. If you want an <em>X-Men</em> book unlike any other, this is the one for you.</p><h2 id="h9088"><a id=""></a><strong>Magneto was right: <em>Magneto (2014)</em></strong></h2><p>The star of <em>X-Men ‘97</em>’s first season was undoubtedly Magneto. By putting him in charge of the team at the beginning of the season and unraveling a dialogue about mutant philosophy and the unending struggle for survival, the show pulled on the best comic depictions of the character as an altruistic anti-hero whose number one concern is his people. If you left the show thinking, “Wow, Magneto is cool as hell!” then pick up his 2014 solo series. In it, Magneto essentially goes on a revenge tour, and it’s a thrilling showcase for the character.</p><h2 id="h9089"><a id=""></a><strong>Just give me what’s new (but good): <em>Ultimate X-Men</em></strong></h2><p>I’ll be the first to admit that reading traditional superhero comics… kind of sucks. It never feels like a good time to jump on, and with constant reboots and crossovers a lot of storylines never get the time they need. But if you just want to dive into the current <em>X-Men</em> with as little bullshit as possible, there is an option for you. Don’t read any of the main 616 universe comics; instead, read<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139"><em>Ultimate X-Men</em></a></span>. Currently, only three issues in, the new series from Peach Momoko is a completely fresh take on the <em>X-Men </em>that requires no prior knowledge. It strips <em>X-Men</em> down to its most basic building blocks and is slowly building it back up in the form of something better. It might not be <em>X-Men</em> as you expect it, but you’ll be glad you picked it up. Trust me.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-recommend-id="image://8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1267" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-recommend-id="image://8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1267" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h9090"><a id=""></a><strong>The best there is at what they do: <em>New X-Men</em></strong></h2><p>Finally, if you just want to cut to the chase and read <em>X-Men </em>at its peak, then you want Grant Morrison’s <em>New X-Men</em>. The seminal run quite literally brought the<em> X-Men</em> into the 21st century in the form of a major reinvention that placed a new focus on the school aspect of the series as well as the overarching use of the characters as a metaphor for marginalized communities. Mixing classic characters and new creations, Morrison drew on their clear knowledge of the series to strike out on a new path. While Marvel has in many ways erased the impact the run had, it remains the pinnacle of<em> X-Men </em>storytelling.</p><hr><p>Of course, this reading list is meant as a guide to help you dip your toes into the<em> X-Men</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-messmer-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following the exceptional Elden Ring DLC trailer, in which we saw more of the upcoming expansion’s world, story, and characters, we all have questions. Namely, who is Messmer in Elden Ring? He’s clearly an important part of the DLC’s storyline, so let’s delve in and find out more!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-messmer-the-impaler">Who is Messmer the Impaler?</h2>



<p>Messmer the Impaler, an upcoming character in Shadow of the Erdtree, is a tall, red-haired individual with twin snakes circling his unique armor. He casts fire spells, wields a polearm, and moves quickly, thanks to his extended gait. </p>



<p>In the trailer, along with many of the press shots we’ve been shown by the studio, we see Messmer sitting on Morgott, the Omen King’s throne. According to Miyazaki, this is meant to show players that Messmer is equal to the demigods.</p>



<p>As part of Shadow of the Erdtree, we’ll delve into Messmer’s story further, learning who and why he exists in the Lands of Shadow, along with his role in the creation of the mysterious realm.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent story trailer</a>, which you can watch below, we see Messmer and his army razing a city. He’s clearly not a hero character; that much is known!</p>

</p></figure>







<p>How Long Will Shadow of the Erdtree Be?</p>



<p>According to current estimates, it will take approximately 20 to 30 hours to complete Shadow of the Erdtree. However, if you play like I do, it’ll likely take twice as long to finish the expansion.</p>



<p>As always, play at your own pace and enjoy the experience!</p>

<p>This new version of what's arguably Kingdom Hearts’ de facto theme song is part of Utada’s greatest hits album, Science Fiction, which was released last month and features multiple re-recordings of their hit songs. Last month, Utada <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/10/hikaru-utada-has-released-a-new-recording-of-kingdom-hearts-best-song">released the re-recorded version of “Hikaru</a>”, the Japanese version of “Simple and Clean”.</p>

  <p id="bJnx9b">The cast of <em>League of Legends</em> is so vast that the best way to find a character of interest is to just scan the roster of champions, looking for a distinctive feature. One easy archetype for gamers to understand is someone with a cool sword; that makes sense, because “cool sword” is basically on the bottom pyramid of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. </p>
<p id="wFBU7O">There are fifteen champions who wield swords; we excluded characters who just use very big daggers. We also didn’t include skins; this is all mainline Runeterra lore. With such an arsenal of swords to admire, we realized that we needed to rank them, so we could determine which of these blades reigns supreme for Cool Sword Day. Here they are, from least cool to coolest.</p>

<p id="5LstQ6">Very large, but not the source of Tryndamere’s rage powers, so not very impressive. Doesn’t seem to have any special crafting; it’s not a True Ice item like his peers in the Freljord, or a cursed weapon, or anything like that. It doesn’t help that Tryndamere needs a visual update badly. Maybe when they give him one they can give him a sword that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p id="3A9nuX">Samira’s extremely cool, and she gets a novelty point based off the fact that she switches handily between gun and sword for style points. Her weapons aren’t automatically cool by association, though. If Samira dropped her sword and someone else picked it up and the camera moved to focus on them, I would immediately fall asleep. Not a cool sword.</p>

<p id="JZToZL">Yasuo’s blade is fashioned after his wind powers, which is a nice detail, but as far as we know the blade is not inherently magical. Yasuo does use it to guide his wind powers, similarly to a magic wand, so it gets a cool point thanks to that being a strong visual image in cinematics.</p>

This is pretty cool, but in the lore of <em>League of Legends</em>, the Solari are currently engaged in a genocide of the moon-worshipping Lunari, and using a cool blade for such an evil purpose means Leona scores a low ranking on the cool scale.</p>

<p id="V2OmkE">Shen’s giant spirit sword is a link to a realm that runs parallel with reality, and it allows him to control the environment around him. Shen is also kind of boring — he’s a taciturn fellow who believes in balance — but it’s impossible to look at his giant spirit sword zooming around on the Rift and not be a little impressed. This is a pretty cool sword.</p>

<p id="oOX9T8">At first glance, Garen’s sword is functional and shiny, but not particularly cool. But his Ultimate ability is where things get really neat; he summons a giant golden version of his sword down from the heavens on an enemy’s head to execute them. This is actually a gift from the Aspect of Justice, and he is channeling her power. Garen looks like just a normal soldier, but he’s capable of summoning a great golden blade from the heavens — that’s indisputably cool.</p>

<p id="XxBMAm">Viego’s an interesting case because his sword, the Blade of the Ruined King, showed up in the game well before he did. In fact, the Blade of the Ruined King was so strong at one point that the meta-game was for everyone to just build multiple of them. In the novel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22989562/league-of-legends-ruination-novel-kalista-viego-story"><em>Ruination</em></a>, we find out a lot of lore about the blade’s history as Sanctity, the ancestral weapon of the royalty of Camavor. Viego unleashing a torrent of hell-energy in an attempt to resurrect his dead wife turned Sanctity into the sword we know today — and that’s pretty neat.</p>

<p id="QFO8LZ">Kayle is the Aspect of Justice who empowers Garen, and she wields her mother’s sword. As Kayle levels up, so too does her sword, and in thein the late game she uses it to send out waves of righteous fire. There’s also some sisterly drama there; Kayle can pull her sword into two smaller swords, and one belongs by right to her sister Morgana. Morgana turned down her duties as the Aspect of Justice because she disagrees with Kayle’s unrelenting policies. Kayle’s sword(s) represent her ideological disagreements with Morgana, but they’re also just cool.</p>

<p id="4r9obK">Riven’s sword does a lot of work. It was forged with Rune magic in her homeland of Noxus, and she went to war with the great blade. When she realized the invasion of Ionia was unjust, she shattered her blade, and carries around a diminished, broken remnant of the sword. Her ultimate reforges the blade, which is taller than she is, and allows her to send out a wave of wind energy. Riven’s sword is relevant to her character, and it has tons of deep lore attached to it — that’s very cool.</p>

<p id="6L0Kdi">League of Legends lore is a patchwork of stories and concepts, some of which have been stitched over several times with retcons. Aatrox is one of these characters; he started out as a generic demon guy, and he’s since been turned into a much more interesting villain through rewrites. </p>
<p id="5HTJtt">Aatrox was one of the Ascended, massive warriors fused from the Shuriman Empire’s greatest warriors with the divine power of the Sun Disc in the capital. Ascended are half-human, half-beast, and many of them draw clear inspiration from various members of the Egyptian pantheon. </p>
<p id="DrJcg0">The <em>League of Legends</em> version of Ra, the hawk emperor Azir, built a vast empire using slavery. One of those slaves, his advisor Xerath, chose to betray him out of spite for this sin. There was an ensuing disaster that wiped out most of Shurima, and the remaining Ascended descended into blood magic and civil war. Eventually, they were sealed into weapons by ancient heroes, and those weapons serve as their prisons.</p>
<p id="n5og70">Aatrox doesn’t just <em>have</em> a cool sword, he <em>is</em> a cool sword. Whenever someone grasps his hilt, he can claim their body temporarily, building himself a pale imitation of his past glory out of meat and blood. But eventually, he runs out of war, and he goes back into the oblivion of sword prison. Aatrox is a Cronenberg body horror nightmare; it’s the best. </p>

<p id="V9F5zy">Lego Smoothie Odyssey’s name perfectly describes its gameplay. You explore the plastic-y cosmos and collect ingredients to make smoothies that are, shall we say,<em> out of this world</em>. Based on a description of the game, it appears to emphasize exploration and allows players to venture forth into a variety of locales featuring landmarks like ancient caves and bubbling geysers. Its goofy, neon pink and purple worlds perfectly match <em>Fortnite</em>’s aesthetic. </p>
<p id="qyCKxq">Prior to all the Lego <em>Fortnite </em>games, Warner Bros. Games served as the main publisher behind a lot of Lego games with licensed IP. This included its most recent release, <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em> in 2022. Now, Epic Games has become a major purveyor of Lego games. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020450/epic-games-owners-shareholders-valuation-sony-lego-tencent-tim-sweeney">Sony and Lego Group invested $2 billion in Epic Games</a> back in the spring of last year. Now we’re starting to see the fruits of that investment, as the catalog of Lego games on <em>Fortnite </em>grows<em> </em>in number and in scope. </p>
<p id="ozAQRq">It started with the Minecraft-esque Lego Fortnite, which paired classic Lego brick building with survival gameplay. Since then Lego Group and Epic Games have continued to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079480/lego-fortnite-fishing-minigame">expand upon the world in Lego Fortnite</a>, but also release a bunch of other games within the <em>Fortnite </em>launcher. Epic Games released Lego Plane Walkers — a game where you navigate a plane by balancing its wings — <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2024%2Fmay%2Flego-islands-in-fortnite&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Ffortnite%2F24161698%2Ffortnite-new-lego-games-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23925739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2024/may/lego-islands-in-fortnite\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24161698/fortnite-new-lego-games-free&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2024/may/lego-islands-in-fortnite&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24161698/fortnite-new-lego-games-free&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">on May 16</a>.

<p id="lT2DMb">Back when I was kid, we played Lego Star Wars games on the Nintendo GameCube. Now people can just download <em>Fortnite </em>for free and get a full catalog of different options with all kinds of gameplay. It’s pretty sweet arrangement if you happen to be a fan of all things Lego, but only time will tell if any of the games end up resonating in a big way with fans.</p>

<p>Following the recent trailer showcasing the game’s gorgeous environments and weapon designs, we’re more excited than ever for Delta Force: Hawk Ops. So, when exactly is the release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-delta-force-hawk-ops-release">When Does Delta Force: Hawk Ops Release?</h2>



<p>We don’t have an official release date for Delta Force: Hawk Ops yet. The moment we do, you can bet we’ll update this guide to ensure you have the information before you!</p>



<p>That said, Delta Force: Hawk Ops appears to be progressing smoothly. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-delta-force-hawk-ops-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent trailer showcases</a> the environmental design, weapon systems, customization, and destruction, which look absolutely on point. </p>



<p>That said, it appears eerily similar to Battlefield. It’ll be tough to shake the comparisons if developer TiMi Studio intends to stand apart from the competition—if they even want to stand apart!</p>



<p>Furthermore, the studio revealed that this is, of course, nothing but a teaser. There’s more to come at next month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-delta-force-hawk-ops-releasing-on">What Platforms is Delta Force: Hawk Ops Releasing On?</h2>



<p>In what’s an absolutely baffling move, honestly, Delta Force: Hawk Ops will launch on the following systems:</p>



<ul>
<li>PC</li>



<li>PlayStation 5</li>



<li>Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li>Android</li>



<li>iOS</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you see something off with that list? It’s entirely possible to launch a first-person shooter of this scale, with the level of detail on display, on PC, current-gen consoles, and mobile phones, right?</p>

Run!"</p></figcaption>  </figure>

  




<!-- cache hit 122:single/related:6ad5b6674865f0a2c31b12875ace6efd --><!-- empty -->
<p>Longtime gamers (and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamegrumps">Game Grumps fans</a>) likely know that even single-player games can be a lot more fun with a friend hanging out nearby to offer advice, shoot the breeze, or just offer earnest reactions to whatever's happening on screen. Now, Microsoft is promising that its GhatGPT-4o-powered&nbsp;Copilot system will soon offer an imitation of that pro-social experience even for <em>Minecraft</em> players who don't have any human friends available to watch them play.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792625882634281231">pair</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342">social media posts</a> Monday, Microsoft highlighted how "real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot" can enhance an otherwise solitary <em>Minecraft</em> experience. In the first demo, the disembodied copilot voice tells the player how to craft a sword, walking him through the process of gathering some wood or stone to go with the sticks sitting in his inventory. In another, the AI identifies a zombie in front of the player and gives the (seemingly obvious) advice to run away from the threat and "make sure it can't reach you" by digging underground or building a tower of blocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Real time conversations with your AI companion Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o. <a href="https://t.co/Ug7EWv2sah">pic.twitter.com/Ug7EWv2sah</a></p>
<p>— Microsoft Copilot (@MSFTCopilot) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These kinds of in-game pointers aren't the most revolutionary use of conversational AI—even a basic in-game tutorial/reference system or online walkthrough could deliver the same basic information, after all. Still, the demonstration stands out for just <em>how</em> that information is delivered to the player through a natural language conversation that doesn't require pausing the gameplay even briefly.</p>
<p>The key moment highlighting this difference is near the end of one of the video demos, when the Copilot AI offers a bit of encouragement to the player: "Whew, that was a close one. Great job finding shelter!" That's the point when the system transitions from a fancy voice-controlled strategy guide to an ersatz version of the kind of spectator that might be sitting on your couch or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/a-newbies-guide-to-why-so-many-people-are-watching-twitch/">watching your Twitch stream</a>. It creates the real possibility of developing a parasocial relationship with the Copilot guide that is not really a risk when consulting a text file on GameFAQs, for instance (though I think the Copilot reactions will have to get a bit less inane to really feel like a valued partner-in-gaming).</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Just hanging out with my AI buddy</h2>
<p>It's unclear from the video clips whether Copilot is reading data directly from the <em>Minecraft</em> instance or simply reacting to the same information the player is seeing. But the social media posts came the same day as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-new-recall-feature-will-record-everything-you-do-on-your-pc/">Microsoft's announcement of "Recall,"</a> a coming feature that "take[s] images of your active screen every few seconds" to provide a persistent "memory" of everything you do on the computer. That feature will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">exclusive to Copilot+ PCs</a>, which use an integrated Neural Processing Unit for on-device processing of many common generative AI tasks.
</p><p>Microsoft's <em>Minecraft</em> copilot demo brings to mind some of the similar conversations that OpenAI showed off during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">last week's live demo of ChatGPT-4o</a>. But the artificial game-adjacent conversation here sounds significantly more robotic and direct than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/is-the-world-ready-for-an-ai-assistant-that-can-laugh-in-your-face/">the lifelike, emotional responses in ChatGPT's presentation</a>. Then again, ChatGPT has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/openai-pauses-chatgpt-4o-voice-that-fans-said-ripped-off-scarlett-johansson/">come under fire from actress Scarlett Johansson</a> for using a voice that sounds too much like her performance in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/people-are-speaking-with-chatgpt-for-hours-bringing-2013s-her-closer-to-reality/">a 2013 movie about a conversational AI</a>. Microsoft might be on safer ground sticking with a voice that is more obviously artificial here.

<p>Speaking of <em>Her</em>, we can't help but think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8zDDPP3REE">one particular scene in that movie</a> where Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore asks for gaming advice both from the titular AI and a hilariously potty-mouthed NPC. Maybe Microsoft can add a casual cursing module to its Copilot gaming companion to really capture the feeling of hanging out with a dorm room buddy over a late-night gaming session.</p>

The preseason includes five factions from various Ubisoft's games. The first four are the Cleaners, Libertad, Echelon, and Phantoms, which will be available to everyone immediately. The fifth faction, Dedsec, will be available to unlock or purchase. The preseason also includes 14 maps, five game modes, and 24 weapons. While most game modes will be 6v6, the preseason will also include a 4v4 ranked practice playlist, which includes the same rules as the real ranked mode coming in Season 1.</p><p>As a free-to-play game, XDefiant makes money from microtransactions.

<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Pod Pursuit tournament is making another grand return for the first time since February. Like usual, you’ll find a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/working-monopoly-go-free-dice-roll-links/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of dice</a>, stickers, and cash to claim, alongside power-ups to help you make more money for your landmarks upgrades.

 <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Since there are no ongoing Partners events, digging events, or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-next-peg-e-prize-drop-event-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prize drop minigames</a> during this version of Pod Pursuit, you won’t find any special currencies or exclusive prizes throughout its reward list. However, you can get additional rewards by ranking high on the tournament’s leaderboard ranking. The top ranks give you a few hundred extra dice, a high-value sticker pack, or cash for your landmark upgrades, while lower tiers provide a small cash prize and dice.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-in-the-monopoly-go-pod-pursuit-tournament" data-injectable="false">How to score points in the&nbsp;<em>Monopoly GO</em>&nbsp;Pod Pursuit tournament</h2> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Scoring points in daily <em>Monopoly GO</em> tournaments, including during Pod Pursuit, requires landing on railroad tiles and completing Landmark Shutdown or Bank Heist minigames. When you land on these spaces, you’ll initiate one of these two games, with the outcomes determining your points. Below is every possible result you’ll find:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true"> <li>Shutdown – Blocked: Two points</li> <li>Shutdown – Success: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Small: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Large: Six points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Bankrupt: Eight points</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">As usual, your goal is to use your dice multipliers to increase these values and fly through the tournament rankings. The minigame points scale directly with your multiplier, allowing you to turn eight points into 800 if you have enough dice to spare and use power-ups such as High Roller. </p>

<p data-characters="216" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant’s&nbsp;</em>default controller setting may initially feel restrictive, limiting your movement across <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-maps-and-modes-in-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the matches</a>. However, by customizing these settings, you can significantly enhance your performance and FPS. </p> <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">We’re here to show you the best&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>controller settings, allowing you to take full control and maximize your gaming experience.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-controller-settings-for-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">What is the best Controller Settings for XDefiant?</h2> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false">For the best&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-xdefiant-down-heres-how-to-check-the-xdefiant-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a></em> controller settings, use these specs:</p> <h3 id="h-controller-settings" data-injectable="false">Controller Settings</h3> <ul data-found-items="15" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="804" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Button Layout:</strong> Default</li> <li data-index="1"><strong>Stick Layout:</strong> Default</li> <li data-index="2"><strong>Aim Assist:</strong> Standard</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Aim Assist Strength:</strong> 0</li> <li data-index="4"><strong>Aim Assist Follow:</strong> 0</li> <li data-index="5"><strong>Aim Response Curve Type:</strong> Standard/Reverse S-Curve</li> <li data-index="6"><strong>Horizontal Sensitivity:</strong> 60</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>Vertical Sensitivity:</strong> 60</li> <li data-index="8"><strong>Controller Aim Look Sensitivity Factor:</strong> 1.00x</li> <li data-index="9"><strong>Controller Aim Scope Look Sensitivity Factory:</strong> 1.00x</li> <li data-index="10"><strong>Dead Zone – Left Stick:</strong> 10</li> <li data-index="11"><strong>Dead Zone – Right Stick:</strong> 10</li> <li data-index="12"><strong>Acceleration Speed Multiplier:</strong> 2.00x</li> <li data-index="13"><strong>Invert Horizontal Axis: </strong>Off</li> <li data-index="14"><strong>Invert Vertical Axis:</strong> Off</li> </ul>

One of the first things you should hit is the Aim Response Curve Type, determining the movement of your aim. The Standard is reasonably balanced; however, I prefer the Reverse S-Curve for more mobility. Of course, it all depends on your playstyle, where you may even opt for Linear, a spec reserved for more experienced shooters.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">One of the most&nbsp;crucial controller settings in <em>XDefiant</em> is&nbsp;the Horizontal and Vertical Sensitivity, which I recommend setting to 60. When I had it at the default, the movement speed felt sluggish. However, with this setting, the gameplay becomes smoother and faster. Similarly, adjusting the Acceleration Speed Multiplier to maximum can enhance your look speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="false">The rest of the&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>controller settings, including the Dead Zone and controller vibration, are mainly tailored to your preferences. The same goes for the Gameplay and UI settings, which can tweak mechanics like speed, crouch, and weapon maneuvers. For a wider view, boost the Field of View to a maximum. You can also tweak this to fit your needs since higher settings can negatively impact the frame rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Did you know an iOS/Android game can be worth playing? Shocked me, too, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/seanbabys-calculords-is-a-free-ios-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but 2014’s <em>Calculords</em></a> made me re-evaluate my opinion, and now I know that <em>one</em> game is worth playing. However, now you can play <em>Calculords </em>without greasing up your screen, as it can now be played on <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords">PC via Itch.io</a>.</p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">Did you know a game about math can be fun? Facts all around! I personally hate numbers. They’re the source of most of my misery. But it turns out that mashing them together can be used for good instead of evil. That’s right. <em>Calculords</em> core concept is waging space war using arithmetic.</p> <p data-characters="555" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">It succeeds by mashing together one of those popular attack/defense games that there are about a million variations of. You’ve seen them. They’ll literally have “attack” or “defense” in their names. This one, however, has you play your units by using cards with numbers on them. If you don’t have a card that is the exact amount as required by your unit, you then have to use arithmetic to calculate that amount. I think that technically means it’s algebra, but if you think I actually paid attention in math class you are laughably wrong.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="583" data-current-count="883" data-injectable="true">I played <em>Calculords</em> back in 2014 and thought it was pretty fantastic. It was designed in part by the internet’s Seanbaby, who made fun of crappy NES games on the world wide web before it was cool. He then had a column in EGM back when it was a magazine and still existed. Now he does 1900HOTDOG with other comedy writers, which is <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported through Patreon</a>. Full disclosure, Seanbaby was an inspiration to me back when I was just starting to write, and I probably wouldn’t be here if I didn’t follow his example. Also, I back 1-900-Hotdog’s Patreon, because why wouldn’t I?</p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="false">That shouldn’t really matter, though, because <em>Calculords </em>is available for <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free over on Itch.io</a>. It’s playable via a web browser. Originally, there were in-game microtransactions ($10 was about all you could spend on the game for everything), but the paid content is just included in this one. The idea seems to be preservation since it was apparently delisted some time ago. Gosh, the future sucks.</p>

This official preview of the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set provides fans a glimpse at what cards and mechanics will return, skips over elements already revealed via the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modern-horizons-3-leaks-addressed-by-wizards-of-coast">April leak</a>, and shows off some updated card artwork.</p>

<h2>The MTG Modern Horizons 3 Preview</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Wizards of the Coast covers a lot of ground as to what <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> will contain. First, the press release confirms that the set will contain Special Guests cards. These are 10 borderless mythic rares in Play Boosters (non-foil) and Collector's Boosters (foil).</p>

<p>Roughly 1 in 64 Play Boosters and 1 in 15.5 Collector's Boosters will contain a Special Guests card.</p>

In addition, 19 cards will receive the borderless profile treatment, 30 will feature the borderless frame break treatment, and 58 will receive the fan-favorite retro-frame treatment.</p>

<p>For Eldrazi fans, <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> has some heavy hitters. The titans Emraskul, Ulamog, and Kozilek return in non-foil and foil in Play Boosters and Collector's Boosters and serialized double rainbow foil printings contained in Collector Boosters. There are only 250 printings of each of them. Good luck.</p>

An example given is Tamiyo changing from Inquisitive Student to a Seasoned Scholar, complete with different abilities.</p>

<p>For fans of Commander format, Wizards of the Coast revealed more info on the sets' Commander Decks. Specifically, we now know the signature leader cards behind the four decks.</p>

<p>The Black/Red/Green deck, <em>Graveyard Overdrive</em> is lead by <em>Disa The Restless</em>, which can bring certain permanents to the battlefield if they are discarded. The Green/Blue deck <em>Tricky Terrain</em> showcases <em>Omo, Queen of Vesuvia</em>, a shapeshifter that can put counters on permanents making them count as every land or creature type.</p>

Lastly the rainbow deck <em>Eldrazi Incursion</em> features <em>Ulalek, Fused Atrocity.</em> This Devoid legendary creature lets you copy spell effects and activated and triggered effects.</p>

<p>The press release confirms that <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> will have forty returning mechanics. Those mechanics include Energy, last seen in the Universes Beyond <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements"><em>Fallout</em> Commander Decks</a>, Umbra Armor, and Kindred. Those last two were formally called Tribal and Totem Warrior, but have been changed following the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/card-updates-coming-with-khans-of-tarkir-on-mtg-arena" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MTG Arena release</a> of <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>.</p>

<p><em>Modern Horizons 3</em> officially releases worldwide May 21.</p>

On May 17, Games Workshop ripped the cover off a new boxed set titled <em>Skaventide</em>. The massive box include 24 Stormcast Eternals, 50 Skaven ratfolk, and a smattering of terrain. No word yet on the pricing or release date, but more is promised on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/17/skaventide-is-the-jam-packed-launch-box-for-the-new-edition-of-warhammer-age-of-sigmar/">the Warhammer Community website</a>.</p>

<p id="xeWtIy">We’ve praised the Genestealer Cults before here at Polygon as one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/16/17704024/warhammer-40000-genestealer-cult-cheapest-way-to-play">the most inexpensive ways to get started with <em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, and the little purple critters are back with a vengeance in 2024. A new 10th edition Codex is on the way and, just like the Sororitas above, that’s being paired with a new Battleforce starter army and a Combat Patrol. It’s the smaller Combat Patrol box that’s really turned our heads here since it comes with a standard vehicle, a heavy weapons-enabled quad bike, and no fewer than five cultists on dirtbikes. That should make this one of the most mobile small-unit forces in the game! Pricing and availability are forthcoming, with <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-the-genestealer-cults-get-a-big-brained-new-benefictus/">more information promised</a> in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<h2 id="Y9ZqjL"><strong>Plastic Adeptus Mechanicus units for The Horus Heresy</strong></h2>

<p id="nwBW17"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23153625/horus-heresy-age-of-darkness-price-availability-release-date-review"><em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em></a> is getting a boatload of new plastic miniatures for the Cult Mechanicum — the first in the history of the line. That includes a dashing, art deco-inspired transport vehicle to ferry them all into battle and <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-the-mechanicum-turns-its-love-of-metal-to-plastic/">the promise of even more unique units to come</a>. Again, no pricing or availability information was shared, but these products are nonetheless expected soon.</p>
<h2 id="eEapyX"><strong>Necromunda gets a major new expansion</strong></h2>

<p id="rlTnxY">Finally, perhaps the biggest news from the weekend is the continued expansion of Games Workshop’s <em>Necromunda</em> universe. Already one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22458895/necromunda-warhammer-40k-getting-started-miniatures-kitbashing-conversions-terrain">vibrant and engaging</a> sectors of “the hobby” as it’s called, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-plunder-the-haunted-depths-of-necromunda-hive-secundus/"><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus</em></a><em> </em>looks for all intents and purposes like a new starter set. Games Workshop is describing it as “a full game in a box” however, noting that it contains a linked campaign for two players. Pricing and availability — Say it with me! — will be announced at a later date.</p>

When Mario first meets the witch, she’s a member of the antagonistic Shadow Sirens group alongside her sisters Beldam and Marilyn. It’s clear she doesn’t get along with her sisters and that they bully her, but the specifics of how and why were slightly different in the English and German localizations on the GameCube than they were in the original Japanese version.</p><p>In that version, Vivian was often referred to with male pronouns as an insult, despite her asserting that the Shadow Sirens were made up of three sisters. The group’s introduction in Japanese and several other localizations had Vivian introduce the group as sisters, which led to her sisters insulting her and referring to her as a man. The English localization, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crElVSsXyHY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crElVSsXyHY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewrote the scene</a></span> to make her misstate the group’s name as the “Shadow Beauties,” which prompted angry, but non-gendered insults regarding her appearance from her sisters.</p><p>In the Switch remake, Vivian explicitly discusses her gender identity and her sisters’ transphobia with Mario. She says she realized she “was their sister...not their brother,” and that her sisters’ bullying has gotten worse since. The constant berating from her sisters is what prompts Vivian to join Mario’s party, and now new and old players can see the original context in 2024.</p><p><em>Nintendo Life</em>’s video review has the full exchange at about the five-minute mark. Vivian’s story only takes up a few scenes, but now you get the satisfaction of taking down transphobic assholes on the Switch.</p><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> remake comes to Switch on Thursday, May 23.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vanillaware-is-looking-for-developers-to-work-on-a-new-fantasy-action-rpg.877536/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/vanillaware-is-looking-for-developers-to-work-on-a-new-fantasy-action-rpg/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vanillaware-is-looking-for-developers-to-work-on-a-new-fantasy-action-rpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following critical hits with <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em>and <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>—which has done <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/vanillawares-unicorn-overlord-clears-the-500k-shipment-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty well for itself</a>—developer Vanillaware has some hints as to what it’s working on next. According to a recent tweet, the studio is actively recruiting staff for a “new fantasy action-RPG.”&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">The recruitment flyer says Vanillaware is on the hunt for programmers, 2D animators, and background designers (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/vanillaware-recruiting-development-staff-for-new-fantasy-action-rpg">Gematsu</a>). While details are understandably light, you can see the notice below. It describes the genre, notes that they’re recruiting development staff, and lists the above roles.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Vanillaware has spent the better part of the past 20 years jumping back and forth between a few different genres. Its latest efforts, <em>13 Sentinels </em>and <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>, were a time-spanning adventure and a medieval strategy-RPG, respectively. Members of the Vanillaware team and Atlus <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unicorn-overlord-devs-talk-history-card-games-and-that-delicious-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently spoke with Destructoid</a> about the development process, where they got the inspiration for <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>‘s scenario and setting, and more.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Prior to those, Vanillaware partnered with Atlus to release fantasy action-RPG <em>Dragon’s Crown</em>. Most of their games have some degree of fantasy to them, fitting the requested bill for the next project nicely. <em>Grand Knights History </em>hit PSP as a Japan-only title in 2011, and before that they put out titles like <em>Muramasa: The Demon Blade</em>, <em>Odin Sphere</em>, and <em>GrimGrimoire</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="false">Some of those games have been re-released via remasters and enhanced ports, which is why the “new” before “fantasy action-RPG” is doing a lot of the heavy-lifting in this listing. Since they’re still looking for staff, it might be a while before we hear anything else about it. Whatever Vanillaware is cooking up, it will most definitely look gorgeous, at the very least.</p>

<p data-characters="314" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the fabled launch of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> directly on the horizon, we already know a majority of what events will be available at the time of release. If you’re interested in knowing where a good portion of your premium currency will come from, keep reading, as I’ll detail each event as much as I can.</p> <h2 id="h-every-wuthering-waves-official-release-event" data-injectable="false">Every <em>Wuthering Waves</em> Official Release Event</h2> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false">According to the most recent developer livestream for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, we can expect four major launch events once the game officially releases on May 22, 2024.</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Depths of Illusive Realm</strong></li> <li><strong>Overdash Club</strong></li> <li><strong>Alloy Smelt</strong></li> <li><strong>Second Coming of Solaris</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">The Depths of Illusive Realm and Overdash Club events were both available during <em>Wuthering Waves’ </em> CBT2, so I can give you some extra details on them. Alloy Smelt and Second Coming of Solaris are newly announced events, so my information on those comes directly from the aforementioned livestream. As always, any information I provide from the CBT2 is subject to chance on release.</p>
 <h3 id="h-depths-of-illusive-realm" data-injectable="false">Depths of Illusive Realm</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Depths of Illusive Realm is a highly repeatable combat event that features a roguelike-style game mode where you transverse various randomly generated rooms, fighting enemies until you reach the boss at the end. Each room comes with a set of enemies you must defeat to proceed to the next, and each victory rewards you with the option to select from several strong buffs to make progression easier. Once you progress far enough, you’ll face a powerful boss on a timer, and must defeat said boss to conclude the run. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="766" data-current-count="1066" data-injectable="true">Before all that though, when you enter Depths of Illusive Realm, you must select <strong>one </strong>main character out of a small roster of currently featured characters for the event. Now that we know <strong>Jiyan</strong> is the first limited character banner in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>; expect him and the four-star characters apart of his banner to be the ones you can use in this event. This does mean, however, that your selection of characters is very limited if you don’t pull on banners to get featured characters. I’m hoping this has changed for the release, but this is how it relatively functioned in CBT 2. You also get to select <strong>one </strong>support character that can lend aid via their Ultimate ability. You won’t be able to fully swap to this character at any point during a run.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">You can expect this event to be somewhat <strong>permanent</strong>, as it is set to be updated over time as new characters are released.</p> <h3 id="h-overdash-club" data-injectable="false">Overdash Club</h3> <figure data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">Overdash Club is a very simple event meant to showcase <em>Wuthering Waves’ </em>robust parkour system. In this event, you’ll be free-running through pre-determined tracks on a timer, navigating obstacles using the parkour system. Once you reach the end of a track, you’ll be rewarded with a small amount of Astrite. There are several tracks to run, but they won’t all be unlocked at the same time, instead unlocking on a pre-determined timer. </p>
 <h3 id="h-alloy-smelt" data-injectable="false">Alloy Smelt</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">Based on information gathered from the official Livestream, Alloy Smelt is a combat event focused on fighting many enemies at the same time. Unlike with Depths of Illusive Realm, you’ll be using a full team lineup to defeat as many enemies as possible to earn points. Based on the wording, I suspect you’ll be able to use your own account characters or have access to trial characters to participate. This is merely speculation, however, so take it with a grain of salt. Earn enough points during the event, and you’ll be rewarded with Astrite. </p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">More combat events are always good and my book, and, from what I’ve been told, this event appeared inspired by <em>Punishing Gray Raven’s </em>Norman War event, which is a permanent mode in that game. Considering <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and <em>Punishing Gray Raven</em> are developed by Kuro Games, I’d expect this one to be permanent with updates as well.</p> <h3 id="h-second-coming-of-solaris" data-injectable="false">Second Coming of Solaris</h3> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="false">Second Coming of Solaris is a simple event where you’ll be accepting item commissions for delivery. Maqi, the NPC in charge of the event, will be requesting daily item deliveries. Successfully delivering commissioned items to Maqi will reward pull currency, among other small trinkets. While this isn’t the most exciting event, more pull currency is always a good thing.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-replay-prototype-demonstrated-but-dont-expect-it-soon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valorant-replay-prototype-demonstrated-but-dont-expect-it-soon.877512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-replay-prototype-demonstrated-but-dont-expect-it-soon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games released a new <em>Valorant </em>Dev Update and shared with everyone some very important information, including the community's most requested feature: replays.</p>

<p><em>Valorant </em>replays have been a request from before the game was even fully released, as players want to look at and examine what happened in their game to understand and improve in the highly competitive tactical shooter. It's a feature that <em>Counter Strike</em> has, and so one that players feel should be in the game, especially now that we're four years into its lifespan. Today we got the first demonstration of a <em>Valorant </em>replay system, however, it is tempered by the fact that it is a prototype.</p>

<h2>Why is it taking so long to get a Valorant replay system?</h2>

<p>A common question, or meme is why it's taking so long, which was addressed in the video by Marcus Reid, the <em>Valorant</em> Tech Lead. A lot of the problem is that <em>Valorant</em> wasn't built with a replay system in mind, which means making it requires a lot of work. For a replay system to be of use to players after all, it has to be accurate, and not show things like doors floating to nowhere, or be a second off on how it resolves all the action.</p>


<p>Getting everything to process properly in a replay, as well as handling elements like pausing that are important to it are hurdles for them, though they are working on it. According to Reid, they are focused on getting it right, so for now it looks like it will be a while until we see <em>Valorant </em>replays, but the prototype demonstrated today at least serves as proof it is on the way. It doesn't appear that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" League of Legends Developer Riot Games Laying Off 530 Employees, Riot Forge Will Cease Development">Riot Games layoffs</a> have halted, or slowed down the progress on replays.</p>

<h2>What is coming to Valorant in 8.11 and Beyond?</h2>

<p>Of course, the replay was only part of the whole Dev Update, although by far the most consequential part in the long term. Map rotation was given a discussion, and the team promised that there would be more transparency in how they are doing rotation going forward. In that spirit, they mentioned that <em>Valorant </em>8.11, coming in early June, will rotate Breeze and Split out, while Haven and a new map will come in.</p>

<p>On the balancing front, they explained a bit about their general philosophy and the reason why they don't focus on just buffing everyone to the upper power that is there now, but also nerf is so that they can maintain the balance of Agent powers with tactics, and gunplay. A focus right now is on making more agents able to fill any particular role, even if it means nerfing the best agent for that role right now.</p>

<p>For balance changes, 8.11 will be focused on the Duelist role. In it, Riot will be nerfing Raze because it is too much of a dominant pick right now for their preference. On the other side though, they'll be buffing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-iso-gameplay-trailer" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" New Valorant Agent Iso Wants To 1v1 You With His Ultimate">Iso (who joined the game last year)</a> and Neon by making them better at what makes them unique, the shield for Iso, and Neon's sliding ability.</p>



<p>Raina is also going to get worked on, as they have found that while she's been very strong in ranked play, she has a poor win rate in higher-level team play situations. While they didn't discuss how they aren't going to do it, the goal for the changes to Reyna will be to make her better in those team play higher level matches, while weakening her in ranked. These will be the last major balance changes likely before Champs, so if you were hoping for something else, it is unlikely to be soon.</p>

<p>After champs, Riot is promising larger balance updates, and mode changes coming to <em>Valorant</em>, with more details to come later this year. Over the summer, they'll also be revealing some map-related things that will be released after Champs.</p>

  <p id="qLULNa">You, too, can try your hand at pulling King Arthur’s Excalibur sword from the stone where it’s stuck in three different Disney parks — Disneyland, in front of King Arthur Carrousel; Walt Disney World, near Prince Charming Regal Carrousel; and at Disneyland Paris, by Le Carrousel de Lancelot. <em>The Sword in the Stone</em> attraction is a small but popular experience at the parks largely because it’s so mysterious. Many try to pull the sword from the stone, but not many can get it out.</p>

<p id="m3LQdi">And it makes sense: Excalibur is the sword in <em>The Sword in the Stone</em>, and as the movie’s story (and Arthurian legend) tells it, only the rightful king of England can pull it out. The parks <em>used</em> to do a little show everyday where Merlin would choose several people from a crowd to test their might, and, <em>maybe</em>, one of them would pull out the sword. The show doesn’t run anymore, but the swords stuck in their respective anvils remain. </p>
<p id="U3Fxkl">Pulling the sword out is so elusive, so rare, that people have started analyzing videos of park-goers’ attempts, drumming up theories on how to up your chances as one of the worthy ones. I know this because, despite never seeing <em>The Sword in the Stone</em>, this park attraction is somehow all over my TikTok feed. </p>
<p id="dnpOJo">Some people believe that you should scope out the area before attempting to pull. If there are two or more Disney cast members standing around, it means a higher chance of pulling the sword up. Why? Because, according to one of the leading theories, a Disney employee has to be around to push a remote-controlled button to make the sword rise. (It’s seemingly on a motor, because you aren’t actually pulling it up at all. If it unlocks, you can take your hands off and it’ll still rise, then go back down on its own.) The other reason is that people believe someone has to be around to give you a certificate, but this one’s been debunked: Disney hasn’t done certificates since the Merlin show stopped. Some people have reported being given a sticker, but the majority of people get nothing but the pride of pulling the sword out.</p>

<p id="kdMfDl">The next most popular theory is that there’s a little light in one of the windows at the nearby castle; if it’s red, you won’t be able to pull it. But when it’s green, you may be able to. Or maybe it’s the placement of the hands — some people believe you have to use the side handles, not the hilt’s grip. But the best tip of all is to just be strong enough to break the mechanism and forcefully release it. <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/01/photos-the-sword-in-the-stone-makes-a-triumphed-yet-unexpected-return-at-disneyland/">According to Disney news site WDW News Today</a>, someone at Disneyland ripped the sword from the stone and broke it so badly that Disney removed the sword entirely for a few days. No sticker for that guy!</p>
<p id="NVtLOK">These theories all have a logic to them, but because of Disney parks’ secrecy, we’ll never really know. Excalibur may be a cool sword, but it’s also an elusive sword — and that actually makes it even cooler.</p>

However, the platform that recovered the most and saw the biggest increase in revenue was traditional PC gaming. </p><p>In Newzoo’s report, PC game sales, microtransactions, and other digital purchases grew 8.4 percent in 2023 compared to 2022. That’s pretty good alone, but compared to other platforms it’s even more impressive. During that same time period, consoles only saw a 0.3 percent increase, and mobile gaming shrank by about 2 percent. </p><p>It should be noted that mobile and console gaming profits are still bigger overall than PC, with Newzoo estimating that 2023's total mobile gaming revenue landed at around $89.9 billion and consoles were at $52.4 billion. Meanwhile, in 2023, PC gaming was “only” hovering around $39 billion. </p><p>“PC revenues from publicly listed companies were up nearly 9% year over year,” reported Newzoo. The market research firm attributes PC gaming’s growth in 2023 to publishers embracing the platform. </p><p>“On the private company side, Valve, Epic Games, and miHoYo showed strong performances. We also saw that successful gaming companies pursuing cross-platform strategies acted as a beneficial catalyst for the PC market,” explained Newzoo. </p><h2 id="h7122"><a id=""></a>Will anybody want a PlayStation 6 or next-gen Xbox? </h2><p>This new report is more evidence of something that’s seemed obvious over the last few years or so: Consoles are becoming less important. </p><p>As modern video game consoles evolve more and more into mini-PCs, supporting mods, keyboards, and crossplay, the reason to buy consoles is becoming less and less clear. It doesn’t help that Sony and Microsoft seem unable to ship as many big console exclusives as before. And both companies are more willing than ever to place their big games on PC. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span><em> </em>shows that this strategy can be a huge game-changer and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-pc-sales-milestone/#:~:text=Helldivers%202's%20success%20is%20largely%20due%20to,7th%20highest%2Dgrossing%20game%20in%20the%20US%20market.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-pc-sales-milestone/#:~:text=Helldivers%202's%20success%20is%20largely%20due%20to,7th%20highest%2Dgrossing%20game%20in%20the%20US%20market." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help increase game sales and player numbers</a></span>.</p><p>While I don’t think consoles are going away anytime soon, the reality is that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474">most played games today are older titles</a></span>.

                <p>The gaming media landscape has just gotten a lot more consolidated. IGN Entertainment has purchased Gamer Network's digital brands, which include Eurogamer, GamesIndustry.biz, Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, and Dicebreaker. As a result of the acquisition, layoffs for some of the affected sites have already begun. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7198698714452959232/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brendan Sinclair</a>, the popular managing editor of GamesIndustry.biz, was among the employees who were let go.</p><p>The news was shared with a number of sites including the now-IGN-owned <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Gamer Network was founded by Rupert and Nick Loman in 1999 alongside the launch of Eurogamer. Gamer Network expanded to include the previously mentioned sites, and also owns a portion of Outside Xbox, Digital Foundry, as well as Hookshot; which includes Nintendolife, PushSquare, PureXbox, and Time Extension under its sites.</p><p>Gamer Network was initially sold to ReedPop in 2018, before the company signaled <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/reedpop-investigating-sale-of-eurogamer-gamesindustry-biz-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its intent to sell Gamer Network's assets</a> in late 2023. ReedPop had been behind the planned relaunch of E3 in 2023, partnering with the ESA to produce the show. However, it was subsequently canceled and E3 was killed off for good the following year.</p><p>ReedPop's Popverse comic book and geek culture site was not included in the sale to IGN. Additionally, ReedPop will maintain its EGX and MCM conventions in the United Kingdom in addition to its domestic comic conventions like New York Comic Con.</p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re reaching the end of your journey towards a shiny new Anima weapon, you’re going to need to farm for Aetheric Density, often mistakenly called ‘Light’ due to its similarity to one of the steps in the Zodiac Zeta relics.</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Aetheric Density is needed to complete the “Born Again Anima” quest of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/">Anima relic grind</a>. It’s one of the last quests and while the requirement may seem daunting, there are some easy ways to hoard this Density very quickly. In total, you’ll need to gather 2,000 Aetheric Density, but don’t worry, it’s not as bad as it seems.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-aetheric-density-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Aetheric Density in Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">If you’re looking for Aetheric Density, you’ll need to complete any duty that was introduced during the Heavensward expansion, including everything from FATEs to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-ffxiv-raid-unlock-guide-coil-alexander-omega-eden-pandaemonium/">Savage Raids</a>. Of course, the more difficult the duty the higher the reward, so if you’re wanting to do this quickly you’ll need to be prepared for some challenging fights. Thankfully, you don’t need to complete these fights synced, so you can get through even the hardest of the duties with relative ease.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">To see how much Aetheric Density you currently have, or how much you still need to get, you can use your Enhanced Anima Glass to open up the interface. There are 10 runes here, surrounding Anima itself, and a new rune will fully illuminate each time you collect 200 Density.</p> <p data-characters="74" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Here’s the full list of duties and how much Aetheric Density they offer:</p> <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="968" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Density rewarded</strong></td><td><strong>Duties</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Vague (4)</td><td>Heavensward FATEs</td></tr><tr><td>Meager (8)</td><td>The Limitless Blue (Hard or Extreme)<br>Thok ast Thok (Hard or Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Vigorous (16)</td><td>Containment Bay S1T7 (Extreme)<br>The Minstrel’s Ballad: Nidhogg’s Rage<br>Alexander Raids</td></tr><tr><td>Robust (32)</td><td>Heavensward Dungeons<br>A Realm Reborn level 50 Dungeons (Excluding Pratorium and Castrum Meridianum)<br>Alexander Raids (Savage 1-4)<br>Containment Bay Z1T9 (Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Sturdy (64)</td><td>Heavensward Alliance Raids<br>Possible bonus from anything which offers Robust Density</td></tr><tr><td>Hardened (96)</td><td>Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr><tr><td>Stalwart (128)</td><td>Possible bonus from Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-way-to-get-aetheric-density-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>The best way to get Aetheric Density in Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">If you’re looking to do this quickly, the best way to get Aetheric Density is undoubtedly Alexander – The Eyes of the Creator (Savage), also known as “A9S”, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-enter-dungeon-solo-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">unsynced</a> with a level 90 Job. Thanks to the massive number of levels between the duty itself and the current level cap of 90, you can steamroll through this Raid solo in a couple of minutes with ease, even with the much lower iLvl Anima weapon equipped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">With its guaranteed 96 Aetheric Density and the possibility of getting 128 for any run, you only need to run A9S a maximum of 21 times. This will allow you to get all the Aetheric Density you need in under an hour, without the need to drag anyone else into the duty with you.</p>

		<p>We’re just a month away from the release of Still Wakes The Deep on 18th June, and developer The Chinese Room has now revealed the full voice cast for its oil rig horror with a new story mini documentary.</p>
<p><iframe title="STILL WAKES THE DEEP | Voice Cast Reveal | Story Minidoc" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuvVm2w49GA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With top billing as main character Cameron “Caz” McLeary goes to Alec Newman, the Glaswegian actor who will be familiar to fans of Cyberpunk 2077 as Adam Smasher. Also joining the cast is Neve McIntosh as Suze, Caz’s wife, while the rest of the cast list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alec Newman as Caz</li>
<li>Neve McIntosh as Suze</li>
<li>Karen Dunbar</li>
<li>Michael Abubakar</li>
<li>Clive Russell</li>
<li>Shaun Dooley</li>
<li>Stewart Scudamore</li>
<li>Nicholas Boulton</li>
<li>Duncan Pow</li>
<li>Sandy Batchelor</li>
<li>Alan Turkington</li>
<li>Noof Ousellam</li>
</ul>
<p>As a first person horror, a lot of emphasis will be put on Alec’s voice acting chops to carry you through the story, but the cast as a whole will get to really lean into the thick and coarse regional accents from the north of the UK, given the setting.</p>
<p>Set in 1975 on the Beria D oil rig off the coast of Scotland, players will have to survive as the rig is torn apart by an otherworldly horror that has been unwittingly released in the unending quest for oil. The Chinese Room is getting to return to their roots as a studio both in terms of gameplay – it’s a narrative horror, so expect “walking simulator” to be bandied about a bit – and with filling this setting and narrative concept out with touches and details to really ground the player.</p>

<p>Newman says in the mini documentary that “The thing was so well written, and so well-conceived, that I don’t recall having very long conversations about what Caz should sound like. With this, you can feel the writing, you can feel the characters.”</p>
<p>Still Wakes The Deep is out on 18th June for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and PC – it will also be available day one with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

                <p>Hellblade developer Ninja Theory is reportedly working on a new game, and isn't at risk of shutting down--like several of its sibling studios have at Microsoft.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the studio's new game has already been greenlit and Microsoft isn't considering closing the studio. Additionally, the new game is reportedly separate from Project Mara, which Ninja Theory revealed back in 2021. There aren't any more details about this new game, such as whether it's another entry in the Hellblade series or an entirely different IP.</p><p>Project Mara is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hellblade-dev-shows-off-photorealistic-graphics-for-project-mara/1100-6486453/" data-ref-id="1100-6486453">billed as a psychological horror game</a> that focuses on photorealism and takes place in one apartment.
