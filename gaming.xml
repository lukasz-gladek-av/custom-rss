To some, it’s all about the power creep; it’s about becoming stronger, more robust than your opponent, wielding the best weapons and armor in the game. But the struggle to attain that doesn’t matter to some—those who are more than happy to tinker with the very code operating behind the scenes of every successful quest. If that’s you, then you’ll be satisfied to hear all about the cheats and console commands in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>; some will even let you become the god of Cyrodiil.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197533" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#commands&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#commands">Console commands you need to know</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#console&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#console">How to use the console</a></span></p><h2 id="h1099476"><a id="commands"></a>Cheats and console commands you need to know</h2><figure id="" data-id="e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-recommend-id="image://e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-recommend-id="image://e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you start messing around in the <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>console, you’ll soon learn that there are many, many cheats and commands within. It’s too many to list, especially considering many of them wind up being rather obscure, altering game or display settings for eking out every drop of performance. So let’s focus on the cheats and commands you’re most likely to use:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>help</strong>: Reveal a list of available console commands (Not comprehensive).</li><li><strong>tgm</strong>: Toggle God Mode, disabling damage to the player and removing arrow limitations.</li><li><strong>tmm (0 or 1)</strong>: Toggle Map Markers, Use “tmm 1” to activate all map markers, or “tmm 0” to disable all map markers.</li><li><strong>showracemenu</strong>: Allows you to edit your character anytime, opening the class selection screen from the prologue.</li><li><strong>sexchange</strong>: Swap your character’s sex from male to female anytime.</li><li><strong>showspellmaking</strong>: Open the spell creation menu to piece together custom spells.</li><li><strong>advlevel</strong>: Advance your level by one, allowing you to place points into your character as per normal upon leveling up.</li><li><strong>player.setlevel (Number)</strong>: Set your level to a specific amount.</li><li><strong>player.additem (Item ID) (Amount)</strong>: Automatically spawn a specific item with the desired amount in your inventory.</li><li><strong>kill</strong>: Enter the command, then click a target in your view range. Pressing ‘Enter’ will kill said target automatically.</li><li><strong>killall</strong>: If you’re feeling particularly nefarious, then you can kill everyone in an area.</li><li><strong>obvgodmode</strong>: Take God Mode to the next level by maxing all Attributes, increasing Skills to 100, acquiring all spells, and receiving 1 million Gold, 10,000 Lockpicks, and 5 Torches.</li><li><strong>player.additem F (Amount)</strong>: This is the specific command for gold, allowing you to become Cyrodiil’s richest adventurer!</li></ul><h2 id="h1099477"><a id="console"></a>How to use cheats and console commands in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="95bfca174bc70fcd127f20e7150a87d1" data-recommend-id="image://95bfca174bc70fcd127f20e7150a87d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="250 cheese wedges on the ground outside of Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="250 cheese wedges on the ground outside of Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="95bfca174bc70fcd127f20e7150a87d1" data-recommend-id="image://95bfca174bc70fcd127f20e7150a87d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="250 cheese wedges on the ground outside of Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before we delve into step-by-step instructions, you should know you can’t access cheats and console commands on consoles, only on PC. <strong>With that out of the way, boot up your game and, on a save file you don’t mind altering (Using any sort of cheat or console command will disable achievements for that save file completely!), hit tilde (~)</strong>.</p><p>Tilde opens the game’s console, allowing you to input one of the above codes or type help to access additional commands. <strong>Once you input your command, hit “Enter” on your keyboard to accept and activate said command</strong>.

The difficulty of hunting a specific Tempered Monster is a great way to tell which Hunter Symbol you can receive.

Some beasts that reward you with Hunter Symbol I and Hunter Symbol II can also be hunted repeatedly by completing specific Optional Quests. Repeating these Optional Quests is arguably the best way to farm the two lower-level Hunter Symbol materials.</p><p>Your options decrease when it comes to gathering the highest rarity. There aren’t any pre-made quests for Hunter Symbol III-related monsters, so your only choice is to wait for them to appear and create a Field Survey quest. The good news is that we can still use this to our advantage. <strong>After creating a Field Survey quest for these difficult Tempered Monsters, make sure to select the Save as Investigation option.</strong> This will add it to Alma’s Investigations tab and lets you fight that specific monster three more times. It might cost you some Guild Points, but it’s certainly worth farming for Hunter Symbol III, as well as materials to craft Artian weapons.</p><p><strong>Another fantastic way to farm for Hunter Symbols is through SOS Flare Quests.</strong> Filter the monster you’re in the mood to hunt and help out a fellow player in need. There are always going to be some hunters in need of help with big monsters like Arkveld or Gore Magala, especially with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332">crossplay</a></span> set up, so you’re sure to get the materials you’re looking for.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>GTA 6 has a proper release date</u></a>, Devolver Digital has announced plans to release a mystery title on that same May 26 date. It’s a chaotic marketing strategy that Devolver Digital seems serious about following through on at least for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery game’s release date arrives after the company previously made the promise to launch a game of its own when Rockstar finally announced its long-awaited GTA 6 release date. We now know that date to be May 26 of next year, so naturally, Devolver Digital has a message: “You can’t escape us.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1918277581167907305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Devolver Digital has an extensive library of smaller-scale titles such as Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, The Messenger, Katana Zero, Cult of the Lamb, and more. Whether the company plans to release a follow-up to an existing series or something new entirely remains to be seen. Upcoming entries in its catalog of games include Baby Steps and Stick It to the Stickman, two projects that are due out before 2025 comes to an end. There’s also Enter the Gungeon 2 and Human Fall Flat 2, which are both expected to arrive sometime in 2026, though developer No Brakes Games has already <a href="https://x.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assured fans</a> that it has no intention of releasing the latter on May 26.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We can confirm that Human Fall Flat 2 will NOT be releasing on May 26, 2026 <a href="https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia</a></p>— Human Fall Flat (@HumanFallFlat) <a href="https://twitter.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More than a year out from launch, GTA 6 is already positioned to be a juggernaut video game. It’ll be Rockstar’s first numbered entry in its critically acclaimed sandbox series since 2013, with many doing everything they can to ensure they’ll be able to play on day one. Devolver Digital is doing its best to get a slice of that pie in a very Devolver Digital way, but we’ll have to wait to see exactly how it will do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>Rockstar’s history of delaying it big-budget releases</u></a>.

With prices on many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-glory-of-team-rocket-single-prices-crashed-japanese">chase cards falling below recent norms</a>, collectors can now complete sets or grab favorites without relying on luck from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-30-2025">booster packs</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interested in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-1-2025">sealed products</a>? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Amazon</a> is discounting a selection of TCG boxes and bundles. From legacy boxes to recent releases, many of these products are coming in over MSRP, which is why I want to let readers know that retailers putting pricing up isn't their only option during Pokémania 2025. TCG Player is a secondary marketplace that is widely used in the US for the gold standard on current Pokémon TCG values thanks to its value tracking across the secondary market. Let's get into it, regardless of ripping open booster packs or finding that dream chase card:</p><div id="218685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Free to Play VR Sandbox Game: DigiGods on Meta Quest</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>DigiGods is a free-to-play, physics-based, VR game that allows players to create, play, and share in a sandbox environment.

It's a compact product with good display value and a steady mix of packs. This big box set is one of the only ways to buy Sword and Shield era booster packs at retail, and it's cheaper than the secondary market right now.

Two of the packs are from Surging Sparks expansion which is nice to see amongst the mix of Stellar Crown and Temporal Forces. If you're only after some illustration rares and nothing too expensive, you'll find plenty of single cards for you binder for less below:</p></div><p id="clair-obsur-merch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clair Obsur Merch">Clair Obsur: Expedition 33 Merch</h2></p><div catalogid="aa330f46-232b-48d9-aa21-2e145ab03cb4" id="220101"><div id="220101" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clair Obsur: Expedition 33 Merch</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Ranging from $15 to $64.99</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Store has launched <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgMBD?object_uuid=ecdc4f49-93df-4ce3-977b-77e17054622b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusive merchandise for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.

For players who want 36 packs to open in one sitting, this works out the cheapest, but it's still around $60 above MSRP.

Think "XCOM meets Hunt: Showdown with a dash of Cthulhu thrown in." Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers describe the setup for Nightmare Frontier as follows: "The story of Nightmare Frontier unfolds in an alternate version of 19th-century America, shortly after a mysterious event that forever changed the world. The line between reality and an unknown horror has started to fade, and those who remain are left to uncover what truly happened that night – and what’s behind the titular Nightmare. The streets were overrun by monsters emerging from the dark abysses of the terror dimension – the survivors called these creatures Dreadweavers. These beings are the physical embodiment of people's deepest fears. Players will step into the shoes of the ringleader, who, despite overwhelming terror, finds a chance for survival in this new reality. Leading other scavengers, they venture deep into the city, risking everything they have left in search of loot."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nightmare Frontier - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightmare Frontier aims to mix turn-based "gun-n-slash" gameplay with gameplay-altering horror, an enticing risk-reward system, and alluring loot. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> Nightmare Frontier on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Full Reveal Presentation</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's an impressive stat for a game that is not only a remaster of a nearly 20-year-old title but one that was also shadow dropped with essentially no marketing (aside from various leaks in the weeks leading up to its release). Oblivion Remastered's big sales numbers are also impressive considering it was released immediately on Xbox Game Pass for consoles and PC, where subscribers could play the game at no additional cost. Piscatella said Game Pass subscribers did not factor into the game's sales data.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is also available on PlayStation 5. More than a few of those sales came from those playing on PlayStation, with Oblivion Remastered, as well as two other Microsoft-published titles, claiming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">top three spots on the most-downloaded PSN games for April</a> in both North American and Europe.</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days after release, Bethesda Game Studios announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">Oblivion Remastered had been played by more than 4 million people</a> across all platforms. Though Oblivion Remastered's release initially seemed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-release-overshadowed-by-oblivion-remastered-is-jokingly-being-re-released/1100-6531174/" data-ref-id="1100-6531174">overshadow some smaller games</a> releasing around the same time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/" data-ref-id="1100-6531269">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's publisher said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all."</a> The turn-based RPG, which is also on Game Pass, has sold more than one million copies.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">Oblivion Remastered review</a>, we said Bethesda's remaster walks the fine thin line between familiarity and freshness, updating the open-world RPG for the modern age while still retaining many of the rough edges and quirks that give the game its character.</p>

And that’s these little cracked orbs on legs that take off like they’re trying to win the Boston marathon when you get within striking range. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197551" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="197551,197550,197547" data-current="197551"><div><p>Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23075.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>They’re called Petanks, undoubtedly named after the classic French game where you try to get your balls as close as possible to get the best score.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-attack-jar-light-resin-1851778839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-attack-jar-light-resin-1851778839">Should You Attack Jar In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>?</a></span></p><p>You might be wondering if and how exactly to catch and compromise these little bastards to a permanent end, and we’re here to tell you that you can and you will, long as you know what you’re up against. </p><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#chase&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#chase">The chase</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#battle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#battle">The battle</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h215338"><a id="chase"></a>The chase</h2><p>So, obviously, the main problem is actually getting the damn things to stop moving long enough to actually catch, since they take off when you’re just inside attack range.<em> Clair Obscur</em> ain’t Plague Tale, though; <strong>there’s no stealthy way to get this done</strong>. <strong>What you’re actually trying to do with these guys is herd them onto a very specific metal plate nearby glowing the same color as the Petank</strong>. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><div><p>That metal spot will freeze them in place long enough to attack. However, that plate can be further away than you think, so if you see a Petank, before you even think of getting this show on the road, clear out every enemy wandering the immediate area. They’ll never put the plate outside of one of the cramped connective doors/spaces/hallways/corridors in the world, so you just need to clean up in proximity. You’ll likely discover the plate while wandering around, just keep its location in mind. </p><p>When the coast is clear, you’re not so much trying to chase the Petank onto the plate as herd it there. Petanks have a fixed route/grid they’ll run in, with specific stopping points. Your job is to simply run them down those lines towards the plate. Once they’re on there, get all healed up, and get ready for a fight.</p></div><h2 id="h215339"><a id="battle"></a>The battle</h2><p><strong>When a battle starts with these guys, your first instinct might be to Free Aim at the big glowy weakspot in the center of the orb. That would be a waste of AP; it’s not a weakspo</strong>t. And you definitely don’t have AP to waste: With only two exceptions, you have three turns total to beat this thing, after which it’ll flee and <strong>you’ll need to either rest at a flag or reload a save to bring it back</strong>. </p><p><strong>Read MOre:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>In addition, each Petank you find has its own specific gimmick/strategy involved. And sure, you can go ahead and try and suss that out with some trial and error. Or, you can just go through this handy list we made for you right here because, idk, we love you or something.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ancient Sanctuary Petank (Act I)</strong>: Starts shielded, gains 6 shields each turn, 9 on turn 3</li><li><strong>Esquie’s Nest Petank (Act I)</strong>: High defense; must be broken to do real damage</li><li><strong>Stone Wave Cliffs Petank (Act I)</strong>: Summons Nevrons each turn; only takes damage when no other enemies are on the field</li><li><strong>Forgotten Battlefield Petank (Act II)</strong>: Applies Exhaust (no AP gained)</li><li><strong>Sirene Petank (Act II)</strong>: Must be killed within 2 turns</li><li><strong>Monolith Petank (Act II)</strong>: Extremely slow, but extremely high defense, cannot Break.</li></ul><p>In addition, there’s a secret Chromatic Petank on the eastern part of the Overworld/Continent maps that you can only get to once Esquie learns how to fly. His gimmick is that he summons other Petanks, and if they’re allowed to escape, they heal the Chromatic one. That fight is rough, ngl.</p><p>Still, once you know the gimmick, it’s just a matter of doing the damage, which you have a lot of leeway to figure out with your current loadout. </p><div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tips-pictos-stains-stances-1851777496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tips-pictos-stains-stances-1851777496">8 Things To Know Before Starting <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>The reward for all your hard work is typically a nice combo pack of Colours of Lumina or Chroma Catalysts, the stuff the Curator needs to upgrade your weaponry and give your team more Lumina points. Considering how tough it is to come by that stuff out in the world, especially at higher levels, yeah, this little detour is almost always worth it. </p></div><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/jackbox-party-pack-11s-first-revealed-game-is-suspectives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Jackbox Party Pack 11 is coming at some vague point later this Fall, and up until today, its inclusions were also vague. Suspectives is the first game revealed for the new pack and you can check out the trailer for it below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YT3BXNBp-xE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game takes inspiration from party games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Mafia</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_Within">Werewolves Within</a> where one player is a secret criminal and the others must deduce who it is. This is done by players sharing personal anecdotes about themselves and then those details become part of the investigation process.</p>

<p>According to the press release for the new game, "Suspectives is a detective-themed social deduction game where players work together to uncover the secret criminal hiding among them. The only clues left behind? Facts that players share about themselves. Suspectives turns players’ quirky personal details into the key evidence for solving a crime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-makes-its-playstation-debut-this-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’ve seen more and more Xbox first-party franchises launching on PlayStation over the last year or so, and arguably Microsoft’s second-biggest exclusive franchise is next in line. Gears of War is finally making its debut on Sony platforms in the form of a remaster dubbed Gears of War: Reloaded.</p>

<p>Reloaded, which is also coming to Xbox, is billed as the definitive version of the original Gears of War, first released in 2006. It has been natively optimized for modern platforms, boasting a 4K resolution and support for 120 frames per second gameplay. Multiplayer includes cross-play across all platforms, and a Microsoft account is not required for online play (most relevant for PS players). The game also features cross-progression, letting you carry campaign and multiplayer progress across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Content-wise, Reloaded includes everything included in the previous remaster, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/gears_of_war_ultimate_edition/b/xboxone/archive/2015/08/26/restored-beauty.aspx">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>. That includes all post-launch DLC, the bonus campaign act, all multiplayer maps/modes, and the complete roster of characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, a remastered version of the seminal 2006 third-person shooter, and it marks the third-person shooter series' debut on PS5.</p>

<p>Per an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded&nbsp;</em>lands on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on August 26th. It's a "faithfully remastered and natively optimized" version of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>, which is to say it's essentially a new version of 2015's&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>.</p>

<p>You can expect all the usual current-gen bells and whistles: 120fps and 4K support, cross-play and cross-progression, and all of the original game's DLC, including the bonus Campaign act and "a full roster of classic characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression".</p>

<p>It'll support two-player campaign co-op play, as well as up to eight players in multiplayer modes, all of which can be enjoyed across different platforms. Signing into a Microsoft account also allows you to enjoy cross-progression, so you can pick up where you left off on any platform.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5's SSDs, you can also enjoy a campaign with "zero loading screens", according to Microsoft, as well as a host of visual improvements like enhanced post-processing and better shadows.</p>

<p>If you already bought&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, don't worry; you'll be getting this one as a free upgrade, although you can't rush out and buy the game now, because that only applies to purchases made before 4pm UTC today (which is about twenty minutes ago at time of writing).</p>

This included the source code for the OG <em>Fallout</em>. Cain complied, which made it awkward when Interplay called a few years later asking if he had <em>Fallout’s </em>source code still. He thought it was a trap; turns out, Interplay had actually lost the code for it and <em>Fallout 2</em>. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928">Cain</a></span> had assumed that due to Interplay’s “destroy it all” policy, the source code for the old RPGs were lost and destroyed. Thankfully, that’s not the case. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 5, <em>Videogamer </em>reported</a></span> that it had heard from Interplay founder and game designer Rebecca Heineman that she had the source code for both <em>Fallout </em>and its sequel, as well as many other Interplay classics. She started preserving every Interplay game after working on the studio’s <em>10 Year Anthology: Classic Collection </em>and realizing how poorly the company’s past work was being saved for the future. </p><p> “I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs,” Heineman explained. “When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included <em>Fallout 1 </em>and <em>2.</em>” </p><p>Heineman confirmed to <em>Videogamer </em>that Cain’s comments about Interplay demanding all employees who leave the studio destroy all assets or face possible “litigation” in the future was true. She just didn’t follow those orders. And while she doesn’t have Caine’s lost and destroyed design docs and notes, she does have the source code for <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> safely secured on a high quality Blu-Ray disc.</p><p> “Interplay had a reputation of threatening ex-employees with litigation if they were ‘poached’, and if they had assets taken home,” she told the outlet. “However, they had no legal leg to stand on which was why a suit was never filed on anyone. [If] they did have a legal leg to stand on, I would have been sued into last week.”</p><p>As for why Heineman hasn’t released the code to the internet, she says that could only happen with permission from Bethesda (now the owners of <em>Fallout</em>) as they are still selling <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> today. </p><p>“I need expressed permission to release, despite the source code being pretty much obsolete,” said Heineman. “I [haven’t] gotten around to asking them. They are on my list.” She is a busy woman, working on bringing back MacPlay and porting more games to Mac. But hopefully, when she does ask, Bethesda is cool with her sharing these important pieces of game history online. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now that they’ve confessed their feelings and decided to live a life of mutual domesticity with a kid on the way, the reaction has been somewhat mixed. Like most criticism laid at the show’s feet, it has to do with how showrunner Craig Mazin has chosen to change the storyline up for the show compared to the game on which it’s based.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197551,197550" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Dina and Ellie’s relationship begins in much happier circumstances.

The two’s budding romance is pretty much conflict-free for the first several hours of the game. Dina is a ride-or-die, ready to help Ellie cross state lines for her revenge tour in Seattle, and most of their time together on the first day in the city is about getting to know each other better in this new romantic context. The first time there’s real tension between the girls is when Dina reveals that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Jesse’s baby. By this point, they’ve been traveling for weeks to reach the city, and Dina suspected she was pregnant for at least some of the trip. Ellie is furious at her for keeping this information from her, saying that they could have turned around and gotten her back home, going as far as to call her a “burden” in a fit of anger.</p><p>The two reconcile the next morning, but the scene illustrates how Ellie’s violent conquest is distorting everything else in her life. She’s concerned for Dina, but frustrated at how this development threatens to derail her revenge. Ellie comes off as boorish and dismissive of her girlfriend’s condition, and it stings hearing something so callous come out of her mouth in the heat of the moment. Compare that to the show’s take on this reveal:</p><p>Ellie is jazzed about being a parent in HBO’s version of the scene. Some fans similarly share the excitement of the mothers-to-be. Part of this is no doubt because viewers have been waiting for weeks for these two to seal the deal, but Ellie actor Bella Ramsey’s humorous “I’m gonna be a dad” line has become its own meme. It’s a sweet scene, and cuteness is enough to win over most people’s hearts.</p><p>But isn’t it all a little too perfect? That’s the argument some <em>Last of Us </em>fans are making, looking at the scenes side-by-side.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></span> user tambor wrote, “I’m trying real hard to defend the show and understand their choices, but why is Ellie so joyous after Joel’s death?”</p><p>“I know everybody’s gonna love this change because it’s funny, but them removing all of the conflict and relationship development and combining it into one happy-go-lucky fairytale moment is annoying,” TikTok user char said in the comments.</p><p>“I didn’t like this change [because] it was one of the stepping stones of Ellie losing herself to revenge,” TikTok user Invader wrote. “I hope they can still flesh this out correctly.”</p></blockquote><p>Part of me reads this as another example of the show being scared to let its leads be unlikeable.

                <p>A lawsuit filed against Bungie alleging the developer used copyrighted ideas in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> just got more complicated, as a federal judge has rejected Bungie's attempt to have the case dismissed and ruled that evidence submitted by Bungie in the form of fan-made YouTube videos and wiki pages aren't acceptable.</p><p dir="ltr">The lawsuit filed by author Matthew Kelsey Martineau in late 2024 accuses Bungie of allegedly copying various ideas from their work, including Destiny 2's Red Legion faction and other elements like a giant celestial object hovering over Earth.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie sought to have the case dismissed but has run into a strange problem. Many of the ideas Martineau cited as being accused of copyright, specifically Destiny 2's original Red War campaign and its Curse of Osiris campaign, haven't been playable for years. They've been removed from Destiny 2 as part of Bungie's "vaulting" process that sees the developer occasionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-vault-of-glass-is-returning-but-old-cont/1100-6478197/" data-ref-id="1100-6478197">remove older content</a> from the game. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-lawsuit-had-to-cite-destiny-2-fan-videos-because-in-game-content-no-longer-exists/1100-6529709/" data-ref-id="1100-6529709">Bungie including YouTube lore videos in its motion to dismiss the case</a> (like a one a 10-hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBmOeYmN_M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Complete Story of Destiny" video</a> from YouTuber My Name is Byf) as well as wiki pages from <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destinypedia</a> in order to show the differences between Destiny 2 and Martineau's work.</p><p dir="ltr">In a declaration included as part of Bungie's attempt to dismiss the case, Destiny 2 game director Tyson Green explained that the Red War and Curse of Osiris campaigns "can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework," hence the studio's use of YouTube videos and wiki pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"As a result, Bungie cannot feasibly provide the Court with the original Destiny 2 game as it existed in 2017, including the accused 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns, in any operable or reviewable form," Green said. "Nor will Bungie be able to produce the accused campaigns in operable or reviewable form if this matter proceeds to formal discovery."</p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, what's happening. The judge overseeing the case said there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the copyright infringement case and that it will not consider YouTube videos and wiki pages as acceptable on Bungie's part, as they originate from a third-party and their "authenticity" has not been established. The judge also stated that the cases Bungie cited in its motion to dismiss are not applicable to this specific case, and that the case "would require a much more complicated side-by-side analysis than those conducted in the caselaw cited by Defendant."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie will reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-reveal-announced-for-next-month/1100-6530898/" data-ref-id="1100-6530898">Destiny 2's next expansion, The Edge of Fate</a>, during an upcoming livestream on May 6.

			<p>Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the first entry in the series, will launch this summer on PC and consoles, marking the classic third-person shooter series' debut on PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>The remaster, which was announced today with a new post on the official <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox website</a>, is being developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, and will be the most complete version of the game, featuring all the content included in the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition such as the main campaign, all post-launch DLC such as the bonus Campaign act, all multiplayer maps and modes, and a roster of classic characters and cosmetics that can be unlocked through progression.</p>
<p>Besides featuring all this content, Gears of War: Reloaded will enhance the original experience on all platforms with 4K resolution support, 60 FPS gameplay in the campaign and 120 FPS gameplay in multiplayer, HDR support, VRR support, enhanced post-processing visual effects, improved shadows and reflections, super resolution with improved antialiasing and zero loading screens during the Campaign. No matter which system the game is played on, signing with a Microsoft account unlocks full cross-platform functionality, enabling cross-progression and cross-platform multiplayer, including the ability to send invites to players across all systems. Cross-platform multiplayer will still be available even without a Microsoft account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-running-unreal-engine-5-features-trouble/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support the full set of Unreal Engine 5 features, but the hardware will likely have trouble running all of them simultaneously.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on how the soon-to-be-released new Nintendo system will handle games powered by the Unreal Engine 5 using features like Nanite, Lumen, and Virtual Shadow Maps. While it's obviously impossible to say for sure at this time, chances are high that games powered by the engine will likely be unable to use all the above features at the same time, not even targeting 30 FPS with significant compromises in terms of resolution, image quality, and performance. Recently, we have seen the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X struggle to run UE5-powered games using all three features, and the Nintendo Switch 2 would struggle even more, considering its hardware.</p>
<p>All the above, however, doesn't mean that we won't see Unreal Engine 5-powered games using these features on Nintendo Switch 2, only not all of them at the same time. According to Digital Foundry, how Fortnite runs on the system is a good indication of what should be expected on the console for UE5 games. The popular battle royale game was shown running at 60 FPS, but without Lumen, which has proven to be highly demanding in a test conducted by the tech experts featuring The Matrix Awakens demo<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/"> ported to the latest public version of the engine</a> running on comparable PC hardware with an Ampere architecture GPU. With Lumen, the demo ran poorly even at low resolution, and with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode, the feature is the prime candidate, together with the demanding Virtual Shadow Maps, that will be cut or heavily cut down to achieve acceptable performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #212: Big Xbox Price Hikes, Doom The Dark Ages Path Tracing, Far Cry 4 60FPS!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAW38VTIJQ?start=6242&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the system may struggle with the complete set of Unreal Engine 5 features, the Nintendo Switch 2 handles Cyberpunk 2077 rather well, so there's a solid chance the system will be pushed beyond expectations once developers get more comfortable developing games for it. We won't have to wait much longer to finally see what the system will be capable of, as it finally launches worldwide on June 5th.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Last year</a>, writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Bungie, claiming that the studio had stolen his work to create the story for Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Martineau claimed that Destiny 2's Red Legion was pulled straight from his work, which was published on WordPress in 2013 and 2014. Bungie responded with a motion to dismiss the case, saying (per <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">TheGamePost</a>) that Martineau's claim "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>
<p>Demonstrating that has become an issue, however, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/court-denies-bungie-dismiss-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-youtube-wiki/">TheGamePost</a> reports that the court denied Bungie's dismissal claim because Bungie cannot provide the court with the original content from Destiny 2 to demonstrate the differences between Bungie and Martineau's work. Bungie can't provide the court with Destiny 2's original content because it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">vaulted</a>, and it's now incompatible with the modern-day version of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Bungie game director Tyson Green described why Bungie can't provide the game's original content, clarifying that "<em>the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' legacy builds can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework, which has evolved considerably since the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns were retired</em>."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Bungie, Green's statement wasn't enough for Judge Susie Morgan, who won't accept YouTube videos of the game's original content or wikis as admissible evidence.</p>
<p>"<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint</em>," Judge Morgan's dismissal decision reads, "<em>he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration.</em>"</p>
<p>Judge Morgan acknowledged that this is an extremely complicated copyright case and not typical compared to previous examples of copyright infringement, which also seems to be part of why the case is moving forward at all.</p>
<p>Vaulting content has never been popular with Destiny players, and while Bungie certainly has its reasons for doing so, those decisions are seemingly coming back to bite them in more ways than just facing the ire of players.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the open-world game developed by Rockstar Games, but this doesn't stop modders from taking the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>A new 4K resolution video shared by Digital Dreams shows the latest version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games running with mods such as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/crxhvrd/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreFx</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/lively-world-for-124497674">Lively World</a>, two known graphics and immersion improvement mods released for the original version of the game that were later ported to the Enhanced Edition. Needless to say, the two mods introduce noticeable enhancements that can make players forget the game initially released over a decade ago and possibly make the wait for the next entry in the series more bearable.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K100] GTA 5 Enhanced: modded CoreFX - Lively World BeyondallLimits RTX5090 RAYTRACING Graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juHYo9QMU54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of the Rockstar Games series will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition for a while longer to experience the best the series has to offer, as Grand Theft Auto VI will not release as initially scheduled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Last week</a>, Rockstar confirmed the game will now release on May 26th, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as the studio requires additional development time to deliver the level of quality fans expect. While the public was only informed of the delay last week, the fact that the game would slip to 2026 was known for a while at Rockstar Games, due in part to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">a real desire to avoid crunch</a>, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about how this new version of the game breathes new life into the popular open-world game by checking out Alessio's analysis.</p>
