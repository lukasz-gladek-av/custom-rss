              <p>If you’re paying for high-speed internet but dealing with dead zones and slow performance in certain areas of your house, your router could be the culprit. An easy solution to actually enjoy the performance promised by your ISP is by investing in a solid mesh system. It works by using the interconnected devices to create a strong network that delivers consistent signals across your entire place.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick one up, as<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/"> Amazon is currently offering a sweet 29% discount on the TP-Link Deco BE23 dual-band WiFi 7 mesh system (3-pack), which brings its price down to $178.</a> You can also enjoy free shipping on your purchase if you grab it quick, but the deal is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag these savings. It’s better to act sooner rather than later if you want to score the discount before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage Throughout the House</h2>
<p>Deco BE23 uses Wi-Fi 7 technology, paired with Multi-Link Operation (MLO), Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM to deliver full speeds of up to 2882 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band with 4 streams. The 3-pack bundle blankets up to 6,500 sq. ft, while the 4x high-gain antennas per node and 4x high-power FEMs push more reliable signals across your home. You can connect up to 150 devices at the same time without compromising on the speeds. Translation? The mesh system is more than capable of delivering the signals you’re paying for in every room and corner around the house – think under the stairs, in the closet, near the balcony, etc. Everyone in the house can connect all their devices, from laptops to smartphones, PC, consoles, tablets, TVs, and more, which is especially great for remote workers and creatives who rely on a bunch of different devices to get through their days. You also won’t have to sit right next to the router to catch signals; the mesh system offers the same performance all around.</p>



<p>Those who need even better performance when working on an important task or gaming with friends can make use of the two 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN ports that come built right into each Deco unit. This lets you create a multi-gig pipeline from the internet to your devices. Best of all, the system uses AI-Roaming technology to deliver optimal speeds. It continuously adapts through advanced algorithms and learns your patterns over time as you move around. The system also plays nicely with a range of providers, but you might need to purchase a modem to get started. It’s backward compatible with all WiFi generations, so can fit into any existing system nicely.</p>
<p>TP-Link takes security seriously, as the Decos are designed, built, and maintained with advanced security as a core requirement. TP-Link HomeShield offers home network protection, plus access to handy parental controls for a safer internet experience. VPN clients and servers are supported, making it easy to access remote VPN servers without installing VPN software on each device. Setting everything up is quite straightforward, even if it’s your first time putting a mesh system up. It should be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re done dealing with painfully slow speeds and terrible coverage of your router, now is a great time to upgrade the internet situation in your home. This deal lets you do it without shelling out big bucks.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is the next big instalment to the series, but the details about this game have been scarce, with players only knowing that the title already has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a lot” of playable content</a>. Now, the developers have revealed even more details, including an important keyword to look out for in FF7 Remake Part 3. </p>

Square Enix is “almost at a point where they can share some more information.” </p>



<p>Naoki Hamaguchi revealed even more details about FF7 Remake Part 3 during the same interview. He first stated that he and Tetsuya Nomura are closing in on the name for the upcoming title, narrowing it down to only two options. The title should be decided within this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently spoke about his upcoming title, OD, stating that even he can’t say exactly what it is or whether it will work out. </p>



<p>The next Xbox Game Studios title by Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions, OD, is already in the works, and we received a glimpse of the title earlier this year through its ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knock</a>‘ trailer. We have also heard Kojima say that he wants to scan ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wishes-to-scan-real-ghosts-for-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real ghosts</a>‘ for his upcoming title. Now, he has revealed more details on the challenges he is facing with OD. </p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-can-t-say-what-od-exactly-is-but-there-are-hints-in-the-trailer">Hideo Kojima Can’t Say What OD Exactly Is, But There Are Hints in the Trailer</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ananweb</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Hideo Kojima spoke about the challenges he is facing while developing OD. He stated, “I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will&nbsp;work out.” Kojima added that they have created stealth and delivery games “which were unlike anything before”. However, even those games had systems similar to other titles, which made the process a bit easier. </p>



<p>In the case of OD, Kojima and team are “trying to change the service model from the ground up,” which has proven to be “quite challenging.” At the same time, the recently released trailer is “full of hints,” so the highly passionate players might be able to figure it out if they spend enough time on it. </p>







<p>In other news, Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-move-to-japan-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive report</a> reveals that Eidos Montreal’s employees were working on OD before being asked to move to Japan. Additionally, the popular game director <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined Zootopia 2’s cast</a> just days before release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Longtime Tekken director and series producer Katsuhiro Harada has revealed he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada, whose credits include not only Tekken but the SoulCalibur series, Pokkén Tournament, and more, said he wanted to reach the Tekken series' 30th Anniversary, which happened last December, as a major career milestone and is ready to move on.&nbsp;</p><p>He says he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of the year, but has been asked by the publisher to appear at the Tekken World Tour Finals at the end of January, and he will be attending as a guest. Alongside this news, Harada has released <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">"TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada's Final Mix" on SoundCloud,</a> as he has always wanted to perform as a DJ at a tournament but never had the chance.&nbsp;</p><p>"So instead, I will be releasing – for the first and last time – a 60-minute Tekken DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement," Harada writes in his announcement <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?s=20">post</a> on X. "Listening to it brings back many memories. Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In Harada's announcement post, he talks about his love of arcade fighting games, his journey with Tekken and game development, and how he sought the advice of longtime mentor Ken Kutaragi, former CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, commonly referred to as "The Father of PlayStation," and "received invaluable encouragement and guidance," noting that "his words quietely supported me in making this decision."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alongside news of Harada's departure, the Tekken X account released a </strong><a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178?s=20"><strong>statement</strong></a><strong> that says the following regarding Harada's upcoming leave:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"Katsuhiro Harada, who has long led numerous projects including the Tekken series, will be leaving Bandai Namco. This comes as the Tekken series finishes celebrating its 30th anniversary, a milestone he deeply contributed to as executive director and executive producer on the franchise. Harada-san is making an appearance and meeting with the Tekken community at the 'Tekken World Tour 2025 Global Finals' Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) and Top 20 finals, held in Malmo, Sweden, on January 31 and February 1, 2026."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The statement also includes words regarding the future of the Tekken series, and they read as follows:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"To our fans, rest assured that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8. We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide. We express our deepest gratitude for Harada-san for providing us with vision and continued success over the years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>On that note, Harada mentions in his announcement that, "Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day," so it sounds like the Tekken series is in good hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Harada's Tekken journey goes all the way back to the beginning, where he was a voice actor for Marshall Law, Yoshimitsu, and Kunimitsu in the first Tekken. In Tekken 2, he voiced Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu once more. With Tekken 3 in 1997, not only did Harada voice Yoshimitsu and newcomer Forest Law, but he also directed the game. Since then, he's been a creative lead on the series through 2024's Tekken 8.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/tekken-8/aggressively-absurd">read <em>Game Informer's </em>Tekken 8 review here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Do you have any favorite Harada memories?

<p>Rose Winters is, if you remember, the protagonist in the <strong>Shadows of Rose</strong> DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a>, having previously appeared in the main game as, uh... a bunch of dismembered limbs. Look, it's a pretty wild story.</p>
<p>The listing from GameStop specifically mentioned some cosmetic items for Rose, including the 'Morphic Visor' and 'Shadow Walker' costume pack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Deluxe Edition includes the PC Steam Digital Code, a SteelBook Case, and the following digital content:</p>
<p><strong>"The Sanctuary" Expansion Pass:</strong> Includes 2 new story scenarios and a major Mercenaries mode update.<br>
<strong>"Morphic Visor" Cosmetic Filter:</strong> A unique cosmetic look for Rose's visor.<br>
<strong>"Shadow Walker" Costume Pack:</strong> 3 exclusive outfits for Rosemary Winters.<br>
<strong>Digital Artbook &amp; Official Soundtrack</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all very bizarre indeed, not least because of how old Rose would be in Requiem's story. The new game is said to take place in 2028, which would essentially make her seven or eight years old. The Shadows of Rose DLC shot the story forward to the year 2037 in which she was portrayed as a teenager.</p>
<p>So if Rose does indeed appear as a child, would she really wear a visor of some sort? Would she wear a 'Shadow Walker' costume set? We're not so sure. Either way, the listing from GameStop is still up at the time of writing, so there seems to be at least some modicum of accuracy to it.</p>
<p>The listing also seems to imply that the popular Mercenaries Mode will also make a return in Requiem, while two new story scenarios are also being planned for the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Lunar Software's long-awaited horror game ROUTINE is finally out and on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One devices, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">even for a game that was announced more than a decade ago</a>, it has the sensibilities of a game older than that. Needless to say, there are a few things you'll want to know when jumping into it yourself.</p>



<p>This guide will take you through a few essential tips and tricks to ensure you can see everything ROUTINE has to offer, without getting terribly lost.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-tips-and-tricks-guide">ROUTINE Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-have-a-notebook-ready">Have a notebook ready</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.11.27-23.07.22.86.png"></a><figcaption><em>Just like any good astronaut, you'll want to keep a record of what happens on the moon in ROUTINE.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't give you waypoints, map markers, or a compass to tell you which direction you're going in. It doesn't even give you a map to look at. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, it's the second game in 2025 to make getting around its environment and figuring out where to go next is a constant puzzle, which is part of the game's draw, as you're constantly building a mental map of each area.</p>



<p>You can do that, or you can draw a map of the space in a notebook to help you get around. That could be reason enough to have a notebook ready, but the better reason to have a notebook and pen beside you - or something to take notes with at least - is all the code puzzles you'll need to solve.</p>



<p>Having a notebook to write down every code you uncover is probably the best thing you can do to make sure you have a smooth time with ROUTINE. Instead of risking a moment where you've successfully made it to where you need to enter the code you just solved, and you have to backtrack to where you solved it because you can't remember the code.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-c-a-t-is-everything-but-it-s-got-nothing-on-plain-old-hiding">Your C.A.T. is everything, but it's got nothing on plain-old hiding</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_005_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Your C.A.T. is useful, but it can't do everything.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your only tool and the one thing that lets you communicate with the abandoned lunar base, your C.A.T. (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), is pretty much your everything in ROUTINE. It's how you save when you find a save point; it's how you scan your environment for otherwise invisible writings that reveal secrets and help you solve puzzles, and it's how you fight back against the robots trying to kill you.</p>



<p>But fighting back will only get you so far. Whoever made these robots made them to last, and while two electric shots from your C.A.T. directly into a robot's chest in short succession can stun them, no amount of shots will actually take them down. Stunning them can give you a window to run and hide, but running and hiding is always going to be what actually gets them off your back, and the chance to progress further in the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-not-every-robot-is-trying-to-kill-you-at-the-same-time">Not every robot is trying to kill you - at the same time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the many things not directly explained to you in ROUTINE is that while you'll see plenty of killer robots on the base, they aren't all trying to kill you - at the same time. No more than one robot is activated at any time, so as you start learning where the robots are in the rooms you're exploring, if you know which one is active, you can walk right by another with no fear.</p>



<p>Unless, of course, it activates right in front of you. In that case, you might be screwed if you can't run away in time.</p>



<h3 id="h-there-are-safe-rooms-but-no-safe-pausing">There are safe rooms, but no safe pausing</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.02-02.47.05.85.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sometimes, these access points that allow you to save are in 'safe rooms,' but not all the time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/">Capcom's Resident Evil series</a> is known for its safe rooms, the areas you reach where any of the horrors you're shooting at can't get to you. They're accompanied by their own music and a few repeating hallmarks so that when you find one, you know you can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't have safe rooms in the same way Resident Evil has safe rooms, but they are there. You just have to look closely. What you can't do is pause the game and think you're safe.</p>



<p>All pressing the pause button does is bring up the game's menu; you can still die if you pause and leave yourself directly in the patrol path of a robot. So if you do need to adjust something in the menu, or step away for a moment, make sure you're actually safe before doing so.</p>



<h3 id="h-really-look-around-and-then-look-again">Really look around, and then look again</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.01-02.16.42.25.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE forces you to slow down and pay attention to your environment, so don't start to panic if you're having trouble finding your way.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As stated earlier, ROUTINE doesn't include any of the modern gaming comforts, like an in-game map. Figuring out where to go means you have to look around you and see what the environment is telling you.</p>



<p>That setup can, and probably will, make it easy for you to feel like you're lost. But Lunar Software's limitations on what kind of assistance you get means that you only have to look in a few places to figure out where to go next.</p>



<p>While some chapters include bouncing between different areas on different floors, most of ROUTINE will involve you navigating a large section of the base connected with hallways and, in some cases, through vents and backdoor entrances. If you really feel lost, keep looking around and zoom in on everything you see. Taking your time to do this will likely result in you figuring out where to go faster than if you tried to speed to the answer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-extends-its-clearance-push-from-headphones-to-home-speakers-leaving-zero-margin-behind-2000651213</link>
            <guid>1376065</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to bring family and friends together this holiday season for hearty meals and some much-needed bonding, good music can lift the mood and make your gathering even more enjoyable. Imagine having soft tunes playing in the background as you catch up with your loved ones on Christmas Eve; wholesome.</p>
<p>You just need a good speaker to make this happen, and Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/">The retailer just slashed the Bose SoundLink home speaker by 18%, dropping the price down to $179</a>. The deal applies to both silver and grey color options, so you can pick whichever would fit within the aesthetics of your place the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bold Sound In a Minimal Design</h2>
<p>Bose has paid attention to the looks with this one. The anodized aluminum paired with a high-quality fabric grille gives off a premium look, while the overall minimal design makes it easy for the speaker to blend into any setup without drawing too much attention to itself. You’ll find all the controls right at the top; no need to go on a scavenger hunt for your phone every time you need to tweak the volume.</p>
<p>The speaker punches well above its weight by delivering crisp, clear sound for all your tracks. It captures all the highs and lows within tunes, and pushes deep bass that can fill any room with good vibes. This makes it not just great for music, but also for your streaming sessions where you don’t want to rely on your laptop or TV’s audio. Dialogues sound clearer than ever, and your favorite songs can be enjoyed to their fullest. Catch up on your favorite podcast in the morning, play the latest Maroon 5 album in the evening, and end the night with an episode of Stranger Things; it takes care of all your audio needs like a pro.</p>



<p>Advanced Bluetooth 5.3 offers solid connection stability and reduced latency. For instance, when the speaker is paired with your phone, you’ll be able to roam around the house comfortably without worrying about audio dropouts, even when things get crowded. Reliability comes from its 9 hours of battery life, which keeps the good vibes going all night long. Best of all, it supports wired connection, too, so you can plug your device in using a USB-C cord when it’s running low; no need to pause the music. There’s also a microphone built right in, which makes it easy to take quick calls right from the speaker or access voice assistants like Alexa.</p>
<p>The sound this speaker delivers is solid on its own, but you can also pair two of these together for a bigger setup, which can be great for entertaining a larger crowd. Linking them together hardly takes a few seconds, and you don’t even need an app to do it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this minimal, no-fuss, but efficient speaker. It’s now down to $179, which is still a bit of an investment, but definitely one that’s going to be worth it. To recap, this speaker offers clear sound, deep bass (even at higher volumes), an exceptional battery life, as well as plug-and-play functionality when needed. Place it anywhere you like, and get the part started. We highly recommend grabbing it quick, before the price goes back up to $219.</p>

<p>Of course, our very own Ollie Reynolds has already delivered his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10 verdict in his Switch 2 review</a> saying that Beyond "manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions".</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cegilotx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The lovely Alex Olney served up a similarly positive summary of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Switch 1 version</a>, which manages to hold up well beyond (pun intended, of course) some loading time extensions and graphical downgrades, scoring it an 8/10. As Alex puts it: "if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had."</p>

<p>So, now that you know where we stand on both Switch console versions of this one, it's time to find out how you've been getting on with it all via the following poll. Have you been loving this graphically resplendent return to all things Metroid, or are you finding the new gameplay elements take the shine off?</p>
<p>Maybe you've already beaten the game, or maybe you're soaking <em>everything</em> in in this stunner; wherever you are, you can give us your score in the polls (for either version) below now, and if you change your mind later or when you beat the game, you can come back and amend it! That's pretty nice of us.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tekken-director-bandai-namco-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-2000651368</link>
            <guid>1376035</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Katushiro Harada, veteran poster and the director of the </span><i><span>Tekken</span></i><span> series, has announced he is leaving Bandai Namco after 31 years.</span></p> <p><span>In a lengthy post on his </span><a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747"><span>X account</span></a><span>, Harada said that the end of 2025 will see him leave the company, and that with </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>reaching its 30th anniversary last year, right now felt like the “most fitting moment” to bring this chapter of his life to a close. Harada reflected on his “roots,” which involved promoting </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>to players in Japanese arcades; he says that those days immersed in local fighting scenes both in Japan and in community centers overseas “became the core of who [he was] as a developer and game creator.” While reflecting on the past, Harada also said that recent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tomonobu-itagaki-death-dead-or-alive-team-ninja-gaiden-2000636025"><span>personal tragedies</span></a><span> and professional movement helped him come to this decision.</span></p> <p><span>“In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life, I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect,” Harada wrote. “Those accumulated events made me reflect on the ‘time I have left as a creator.’ During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</span></p>

 <p><span>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Harada signs off by saying he will still be attending the Tekken World Tour finals in January as a guest, and by dropping an hour-long </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>mix called “Tekken: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix” on </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><span>Soundcloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Harada served as a voice actor in the first two </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>games before stepping up to the director role with </span><i><span>Tekken 3 </span></i><span>in 1997. He’s also worked on other fighting game series, such as </span><i><span>Soulcalibur</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokken Tournament</span></i><span>, and contributed to various other Bandai Namco games as a producer and supervisor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kids will be cleaning up on LEGO sets for the holidays, as they have for decades. But how about LEGO’s adult fans who are just kids at heart, especially the ones who’ve been devout LEGO Star Wars fans for most or all of the years those sets have been sold? Yes, there are deals for them too, perhaps none better than <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">this Amazon sale on the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectible Model, which is 20% off right now.</a></p>
<p>This intricately detailed, displayable 921-piece commemorative model of the iconic Millennium Falcon is a $68 steal for LEGO Star Wars fans 18 and up. Years after the fun of building the LEGO Falcon, it will likely still be proudly displayed in your home, with its special LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary brick identifying it as a collector’s item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All the Details</h2>
<p>The design of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon includes all of the intricate little details that Star Wars obsessives would insist on, including the ship’s cockpit, satellite dish, and cannons. With 921 pieces creating a model that, when fully assembled, measures 5 by 9.5 by 7.5 inches, there’s a lot of material packed into a relatively small space for all those details.</p>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon comes with a display stand that lets you position the ship at dynamic angles for a more attractive look. It’s not a playable model, so keep it out of the hands of the littles, but when it’s standing on its base and angled to look like it’s zooming through space, it’s a true eye-catcher.</p>



<h2>Relaxing and Rewarding</h2>
<p>As much as you will enjoy seeing the Falcon displayed in your home for years to come and having it become a conversation piece with guests, the real enjoyment is, of course, the actual building. Assembling he LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon is finely detailed work, allowing you to immerse yourself in the process. Think of the old ship in a bottle models, or the very intricate models requiring glue and paint. The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon requires the same focus, but provides a relaxing experience while being far, far more forgiving of error than those old-school hobbies. And if you really enjoy the building process, they’re LEGOs — you can always take it apart and build it all over again, as many times as you like.</p>
<p>The 25th anniversary of the LEGO Star Wars franchise has birthed a large collectible series of mid-scale buildable models from the Star Wars canon, but perhaps none quite so familiar and iconic to both hardcore fans and casual ones alike as the Millennium Falcon. This kit for builders 18 and up is an amazing present for the Star Wars enthusiast in your life, or for yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Jump on it now at Amazon while it’s still on sale for $68.</a></p>

GameStop said in a news release that it took in more than 80,000 trades across the US on December 6 alone, and people brought in lots of unexpected and usual items, including a taxidermied bobcat and goose, a speed limit sign, a Wii Netflix disc, a bowling ball, a tiny Jesus, and "a literal can of whoop-ass."</p><p>This was all done as a marketing campaign to raise awareness for GameStop's trade-in program. The retailer also noted that people brought in "a significant number" of canned food goods to support food banks and pet shelters.</p><p>One person attempted to trade in their dog (presumably as a joke, we hope!) but was <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rejected.</a> Another person <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997478744215466157" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tried to trade in their Social Security card but GameStop said no.</a> Someone else brought in a copy of the Declaration of Independence, and GameStop seemingly accepted it.</p><p>The fine print of the Trade Anything promotion mentioned that people would be limited to one trade and a value of $5. It's not immediately clear what GameStop is doing with all the items people brought.</p><p>The Deptford, New Jersey GameStop location took in the most trades, at more than 250.</p><p>Here are some of the notable traded items, as shared by GameStop.</p><ul><li>A bobcat</li><li>A goose</li><li>A tiny Jesus</li><li>A full creepy doll collection</li><li>Air Jordans</li><li>A speed limit sign</li><li>Complete Friends season VHS tapes</li><li>Bowling ball</li><li>A “happy heater”</li><li>A framed dog portrait</li><li>A literal can of whoop-ass</li><li>A Wii Netflix disc</li><li>Non-alcoholic cider donated to store employees</li></ul><p>In other news, GameStop is among the numerous retailers that are not raising Xbox Game Pass prices, so you can still buy one month of Game Pass Ultimate for $20 there.

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>These are made for extended use. That’s thanks to a comfortable padded band paired with plush over-ear cushions that hug your ears softly for a secure, snuggly fit. The band keeps them in place, even when you’re taking a walk, jogging around, or trying to get a workout in with some energetic music to keep you going.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; Quiet and Aware. The quiet mode blocks all the external noise, offering an immersive listening experience with no distractions. It’s great for when you want to focus on a task and don’t want background chatter and noise impacting your flow (or chain of thoughts) negatively. Aware mode, on the other hand, keeps you..well, aware of your surroundings. It lets some sounds in, making it easy to stay in the loop on what’s happening around you. You’ll be able to have conversations with this on, hear when the barista calls your name, etc. This mode is great for when you’re in a public area and can’t afford zoning out completely. Adjustable EQ makes it easy to tweak audio settings based on what you like, so you’ll always enjoy a custom listening experience.</p>



<p>The headphones offer up to 24 hours of battery on a single charge, which is more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging them in. Plus, when running low, a quick 15-minute charge via USB-C gives you an additional 2.5 hours of jamming; perfect for when you’re on the go and don’t have the time to power them up completely. Even better, these support wired connectivity just as well, so you also have the option to use them with the included audio cable, too, which works even when you’re out of battery. It’s best to use the pair with the dedicated Bose app to enjoy the latest features and adjust settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">Amazon is letting you grab these for just $179 now, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You’re saving 49% on a top-rated option, plus there are several color options to choose from, which makes it easy to choose the one that fits your aesthetics the best. But again, grab it quickly, as once the deal is gone, it likely won’t come back anytime soon.</p>

<p>It’s time to admit, before God and the good readers of Ars Technica, that I have a problem. I love roguelikes. Reader, I can’t get enough of them. If there’s even a whisper of a hot new roguelike on Steam, I’m <em>there</em>. You may call them arcane, repetitive, or maddeningly difficult; I call them heaven.</p>
<p>The second best part of video games is taking a puny little character and, over 100 hours, transforming that adventurer into a god of destruction. The best thing about video games is doing the same thing in under an hour. Beat a combat encounter, get an upgrade. Enter a new area, choose a new item. Put together a build and watch it sing.</p>
<p>If you die—immediately ending your ascent and returning you to the beginning of the game—you’ll often make a pit stop at a home base to unlock new goodies to help you on your next run. (Some people distiguish between roguelikes and “roguelites,” with the latter including permanent, between-run upgrades. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll use “roguelike” as an umbrella term).</p>
<p>2025 has been a truly horrific year for most things. But for roguelikes? It’s been an embarrassment of riches. Because I’m an editor and there’s no one here to stop me, I’d like to tell you about them. To keep things manageable, I’ll stick to games that hit 1.0 in 2025.</p>
<h2><em>Hades II</em></h2>


<figure>

      </figure>

<p>Where else could we start? In a year of wall-to-wall video game showstoppers, <em>Hades II</em> sticks out. The first <em>Hades</em> got our nod for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2020/">best game of 2020</a>, and <em>Hades 2</em> certainly has my vote for 2025.</p>
<p>This time, you play as Melinoë, sister to <em>Hades</em> protagonist Zagreus and daughter of Hades himself, as she attempts to take back the house of Hades from Chronos, the titan of time. The cast of Olympian gods returns to bestow blessings (upgrades to your various attacks and defensive maneuvers) to help you on your way. If you played the first game, you’ll know what you’re getting into here; the sequel just vastly expands the content and mechanics.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As you fight through the game’s two different paths, you’ll slowly uncover the game’s story via little snippets of dialogue (there’s a truly mind-boggling amount of dialogue in this game), and oodles of unlockables and endgame challenge runs ensure you’ll be playing for a long time.</p>
<p>You won’t find many roguelikes with higher production values. The game is $30. Madness! If you like roguelikes, you’ve probably already picked this up. I’ll go further, though. If you enjoy video games at all, you should buy <em>Hades II</em>. It’s that good.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit</em></h2>



<p>You ever boot up a new game and immediately think, “Well, this thing is going to be a problem for me”? Yeah.</p>
<p>We’ve been blessed with several pachinko-style roguelites over the past couple of years (<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/peglin-is-the-roguelike-peggle-rpg-we-didnt-know-we-needed/">Peglin</a></em>, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/">Ballionaire</a></em>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3191030/Nubbys_Number_Factory/"><em>Nubby’s Number Factory</em></a> are all worth your time); now comes a take on another ball-centric classic. I’m talking about last month’s <em>Ball x Pit</em>, a roguelite version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)"><em>Breakout</em></a>. Or at least that’s the simple way to describe it. In actuality, the game is that rarest of finds: something that feels unique.</p>
<p>Take one of your many and varied characters onto the battlefield, and you’ll lob a stream of balls toward the top of the screen, where slowly descending enemies periodically fire attacks back at you. When you level up, you’ll choose “special balls,” which have all manner of effects, like inflicting fire or poison on enemies or balls that explode into other balls. As the game progresses, you can “fuse” these balls together, combining the effects. Sometimes, you’ll be able to “evolve” two balls into an entirely new type of ball. Not enough for you? Slam two evolved balls together for even more wackiness.</p>
<p>The moment-to-moment gameplay is fantastic, with different characters and upgrades forcing you to play differently to succeed. The game doles out new mechanics and surprises along the way to keep things fresh, though this is a game you can “complete”; the between-run metaprogression eventually lets you become a bit of a god.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A base-building system—and a minigame in which you bounce your characters around the map to activate buildings—is a nice, thematic diversion between runs, but it’s mostly just a flashy upgrade screen. I usually just wanted to get back into the game as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Need more convincing? Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651790/BALL_x_PIT_Demo/">free demo</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Absolum</em></h2>



<p><em>Absolum</em>’s well-regarded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713610/Absolum_Demo/">demo</a> was released in June, but this thing came out of nowhere for me. The elevator pitch: a beat ‘em up, but make it roguelite.</p>
<p>Not really a beat ‘em up fan? Me neither. Doesn’t matter. The last side-scrolling brawler I played for more than an hour was probably 1991’s <em>The Simpsons</em> arcade game or that same year’s <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</em> (though the original TMNT arcade game from 1989 was my first quarter-munching arcade love).</p>

<p>The game features gorgeous hand-drawn visuals and the year’s best soundtrack, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yShiPI-gPeA&amp;list=RDyShiPI-gPeA&amp;start_radio=1">this absolute banger</a> from <em>Doom</em>’s Mick Gordon (that’s from a particularly metal boss fight; most of the songs are more fantasy-forward).</p>
<p>Over your runs, you’ll traverse multiple paths, finding secrets and unlocking new features. The roguelike elements are a bit thin at first, but piecing together powerful builds becomes simple as you fill out your options. The combat is sublime—you can get away with button-mashing for a while, but you’ll want to learn at least some of its intricacies to make it to the end.</p>
<p>This thing’s the complete package, and it’s easily one of the best games of the year. Bring along a friend if you’re into co-op. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713610/Absolum_Demo/">surprisingly beefy demo</a> is still available—there’s really no excuse not to check it out.</p>
<h2><em>Clover Pit</em></h2>



<p>I’ve never actually been to a casino, but judging by the electric dopamine surge I get when hitting a jackpot in the slot machine roguelike <em>Clover Pit</em>, I know I should maintain my chastity.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Clover Pit</em> locks you in a disgusting, blood-soaked closet of a room, and the only way to earn your freedom is to deposit money into an ATM over a series of ever-increasing payments. In other words, it’s what’s come to be known in some circles as a <em>Balatro</em>-like, aka a numbers-go-up game (of course, <em>Balatro</em> was just the first such game to hit it big; the genre’s true progenitor came a year or so earlier in the form of another excellent slot machine roguelike, <em>Luck be a Landlord</em>).</p>
<p>Standing on a trap door that will drop you to your death if you fail to hit your deadlines, you’ll pull a lever on a slot machine over and over, hoping to hit it big. It’s not totally random, though, of course. Purchaseable trinkets allow you to manipulate your odds, trigger beneficial effects, and multiply your score. Getting a jackpot of all 7’s? It’s easier than you may think.</p>
<p>Don’t expect <em>Balatro</em>-like depth—most strategies here involve simply picking one symbol and buffing it to high heaven—but fun, game-breaking builds are easy to put together to make you feel like a winner. There’s something disconcertingly hypnotic and soothing about repeatedly pulling a slot machine lever—it’s best to do it here, where you won’t end up losing your home.</p>
<h2><em>Shape of Dreams</em></h2>



<p>I’ve been playing the hell out of this game, but if you stopped me on the street, I could not tell you what it’s called. Forgettable name aside, I love it.</p>
<p>I’ve heard the game’s combat and controls described as MOBA-like. That seems reasonable, at least from what I remember from my ill-advised and short-lived attempt to get into <em>Dota 2</em> a decade ago. Don’t let that scare you off, though; this is basically a top-down action RPG where you’ll be fighting through small rooms of enemies, <em>Hades</em>-style.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>What makes it special is its skill system. You start each run with a couple of attacks and a passive ability, and you’ll pick up (and replace) skills as you go. Each skill—here called “memories” (don’t ask me; I skipped the lore)—can fit up to three “essences,” modifications that affect how the skill functions. You can rearrange these modifications at any time, enabling a “make your own skill” system that’s endlessly fascinating.</p>
<p>Unique unlockable characters and robust metaprogression skill trees will keep you busy for embarrassing amounts of time. You can even play with friends. Before long, you’ll be creating game-breaking, room-nuking builds, the hallmark of my favorite games of the genre.</p>
<h2><em>Megabonk</em></h2>



<p>As its name might suggest, <em>Megabonk</em> is not a serious game. Unlike some other games on this list, there’s no chance of this one becoming an all-time great. But there’s a reason this buzzy little title has been on many gamers’ lips since its release in September. The concept is simple: it’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> meets <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve played both games, mash them up in your mind and you’ll know exactly how this thing plays. And not just in the way that most “<em>Survivor</em>-likes” tread extremely similar ground to the original. <em>Megabonk</em>‘s treasure-chest-opening animation is ripped straight from <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and the game’s structure and items (down to the artwork style) are basically just <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.</p>
<p>So no, it’s in no way original. And I was disappointed to learn that there are only two real “stages” to play; a <em>Risk of Rain-</em>style teleporter just takes you to a harder version of the stage you’ve picked. There are also balance issues; the damage scaling on anything but the first 10-minute stage is absurd. But there is some ridiculous fun to be had with it.</p>
<p>If you’re not into the whole auto-shooter/bullet heaven thing, there’s nothing here for you. But if you’re interested in seeing how chaotic a third-person <em>Vampire Survivors</em> can get, step right up.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It’s also the one 2025 game where you can play as a sunglasses-wearing, skateboarding skeleton who throws bouncing bones at enemies. In these tough times, that’s not nothing.</p>
<h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></h2>



<p>We’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-is-a-fine-entry-point-into-the-auto-shooting-depths/">talked about</a> this <em>Survivors</em>-like take on the beloved co-op shooter <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> a couple of times over its Early Access period, but we were remiss in discussing it upon its 1.0 release last month. The game was already an Ars favorite, but its progression systems still needed a bit of work. It’s now ready for public consumption, and it’s one of the best auto-shooters on the market. It’s so good that you might want to take a look at it even if you want nothing to do with the oversaturated subgenre.</p>
<p>Its <em>Vampire Survivor</em>-like bones are obvious—you walk around a map while your weapons fire automatically at hordes of enemies closing in on you. Collect the XP gems defeated enemies drop to level up and choose an upgrade. The difference here is that you’re also able to mine through walls of rocks, letting you escape tricky situations and funnel bad guys to traps you’ve laid.</p>
<p>The progression system is heavy on the grind, but there’s plenty of fun to be had no matter how hardcore you want to be about it.</p>
<p>Rock and stone!</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em></h2>



<p>Five years after the original, it’s time for the sequel to the second-best roguelike deckbuilder of all time (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">the sequel to the first-best roguelike deckbuilder</a> has—thankfully, if I’m being honest—been delayed until the beginning of next year). As in the first game, and as the game’s title might suggest, you’ll be fighting monsters on a train, trying to stop them before they ascend three floors to reach your “pyre”—your health pool for the run.</p>
<p>In <em>Monster Train 2</em>, as in any deckbuilder, you start with a fairly crappy deck of cards and upgrade and expand it throughout your run to try to make it to the end. But in addition to the usual spells and attacks, <em>Monster Train 2</em> gives you units to assign to the different levels of your battlefield, infusing an interesting spatial element to the cartoonishly violent proceedings.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The sequel is more of the first game, but with smart updates that make everything flow smoother. It’s one of my favorite games of the year, and I highly recommend it to any fan of tactical card games.</p>
<h2><em>Deadzone Rogue</em></h2>



<p><em>Deadzone Rogue</em> instantly joins the pantheon of roguelite first-person looter shooters, which includes perennial favorites <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217060/Gunfire_Reborn/"><em>Gunfire Reborn</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/692890/Roboquest/"><em>Roboquest</em></a> (I haven’t played them yet, but the brand-new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721110/Abyssus/"><em>Abyssus</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2615540/VOIDBREAKER/"><em>Void/Breaker</em></a> are also generating a bunch of buzz).</p>
<p>Where <em>Roboquest</em> excels at fun, <em>Doom</em>-like movement and colorful environments, <em>Deadzone Rogue</em> is all about the shooting. The game has the best gunplay of any FPS roguelike I’ve played, and the random weapons, armor, and upgrades you get give each run a sense of personality.</p>
<p>The game’s music, voice acting, and lore are best ignored, but the sound design is nice and punchy. This won’t be a game you’ll play for 100 hours, but sometimes it’s just fun to shoot a gun in a video game, and <em>Deadzone Rogue</em> gets that simple formula right.</p>
<h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2>



<p>Look, I’m going to cheat here, and I’m not ashamed of it. It’s true—<em>9 Kings</em> is not fully released. But I can’t not talk about. I initially wrote the game off when it was released into Early Access in July, thinking it looked too simple. It <em>is</em> simple, but that’s to its credit.</p>
<p>The premise is easy to explain: Build a little kingdom on a 3-by-3 grid of squares. Play a card to construct or upgrade a building or unit in your kingdom. Afterward, a neighboring kingdom will attack, and your units will automatically fight to defend your home. After the battle, you draft a card from the defeated kingdom to add to your hand.</p>
<p>As you can see from the above screenshot, you can expand your kingdom beyond the initial nine squares, and unlockable perks change up the way you play each king. A handful of enemies are randomly chosen from the pool of nine, meaning that the cards you can draft each run will be different.</p>
<p>Making busted builds and fighting your way up the difficulty levels is extremely compelling; there was a week where the “one more run” curse descended on me, and I did little else than play this game.</p>

                <p>The popular AI VTuber Neuro-Sama is attempting to complete<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990"> Minecraft</a> Hardcore, and her human supervisors appear to be losing all hope following a series of comedic but disappointing failures on her part.</p><p>Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>, and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to "see" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers<a href="https://twitch.tv/crelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Crelly </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/filian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filian</a>, has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcE_dHvaN2Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZcE_dHvaN2Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-to-the-end-in-minecraft/1100-6531635/" data-ref-id="1100-6531635">The End</a> to face off against the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/" data-ref-id="1100-6531625"> Ender Dragon</a>--not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.</p><p>As if that didn't sound complex enough, Neuro has been making some interesting choices that have resulted in yet another world reset. Neuro often gets overwhelmed with bloodlust, seeking out mobs during the night and facing off against them with less than ideal strategies. She's not yet mastered the "hit and shield" approach of attacking mobs, so she'll repeatedly land weak attacks on them until they inevitably overcome her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQNHxSGrVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UcQNHxSGrVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside the usual Minecraft deaths--such as being blown up by Creepers, attacked by an Enderman, or falling into a lava pit--Neuro has seemingly decided to troll her creator and his friends. Clad entirely in enchanted diamond armor, the four set off for the Nether to find Blaze Rods--an ingredient essential for finding the portal to The End--where Neuro immediately began to build a bridge over a large lava lake. After taking an extended look back at the portal to the overworld, she spammed crouch and then walked off the end of the bridge and burned to death.</p><p>On another attempt, after becoming overwhelmed by that aforementioned bloodlust, Neuro slayed an innocent Villager. In Minecraft, if you damage a Villager in a village protected by an Iron Golem, that Golem will not take kindly to your actions. Neuro found this out the hard way, and in just two hits she was dead, and the run was over.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPyoaBEc5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xPyoaBEc5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As the attempts progress, Crelly--who has become Neuro's "stepmother" and often entrusted with babysitting the AI--is becoming increasingly frustrated with Neuro's frequent mistakes. "She wants to die!" yelled the cow YouTuber after attempt number 74. "Neuro, Neuro, Neuro!" she shouts during attempt 80, when Neuro-Sama insisted upon digging upwards out of a safe area Crelly had created for her. "Neuro, that's an Enderman; let's not look at him. Follow me!" she adds. It's safe to say the trust in Neuro's Minecraft capabilities is rapidly depleting.</p><p>At the time of writing, the streamers are taking a sleep break after attempt number 83, and the stream has been live since Friday, December 5, at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM GMT. According to YouTube editor <a href="https://youtu.be/4xPyoaBEc5k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KeidenEdits</a>, Neuro has been responsible for 47 deaths, Filian for 14 deaths, Vedal for 13 deaths, and Crelly for 10 deaths. Of those statistics, 17 have been Zombies, 11 have been Creepers, and 11 have been Skeletons. Nine deaths have resulted from fall damage, eight from drowning, four from the Iron Golem, four from lava, Neuro has turned homicidal four times, the Drowned mob has committed two murders, two from Zombified Piglins, two from an Enderman, and one a piece for the Witch, Spider, Husk, and Guardian mobs. Neuro has starved to death once, Vedal has accidentally killed once, and Neuro has suffocated in sand once.</p><p>The four plan to resume their attempts today, December 8, at 8:30 AM PT / 11:30 AM ET / 4:30 PM GMT.</p>

<p>Welcome to my portable world, insect</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios is bringing its awesome <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake to the Switch and Switch 2, and we can now exclusively reveal that it'll be available to play from <strong>18th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2023, System Shock is a comprehensive yet faithful remake of the 1994 FPS from Looking Light Studios. Development was lengthy and somewhat troubled, with Nightdive striving to reboot the original with more modern design principles.</p>
<p>In the end, however, to deliver on the promises of its initial Kickstarter campaign, the team chose to lean more towards a remake, keeping the core elements of the original intact while introducing a plethora of quality-of-life updates.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Nightdive succeeded in its goal, and System Shock received mostly positive critical acclaim upon release. Taking place in the year 2072, you play as an unnamed hacker who awakens in a station under total control of SHODAN, an AI completely removed from its moral and ethical restraints. Grotesque mutations and cyborgs roam the station, and it's up to you to defeat SHODAN.</p>
<p>With visuals blending pixel art textures and modern lighting technology, the System Shock remake is, to put it lightly, a <em>vibe</em>. It's a significantly different experience compared to System Shock 2, which Nightdive also released on the Switch earlier this year. If you're curious, we definitely recommend giving it a shot. For those on Switch 2, the game will offer up both gyro aiming and optional mouse controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Unravel the chilling story of SHODAN's rise and explore the mysteries of Citadel Station, piecing together the truth in this atmospheric sci-fi world</p>
<p>- Face perilous traps, puzzles, and a legion of hostile and mutated creatures — created and controlled by the villainous SHODAN herself</p>
<p>- Choose between a male or female-presenting Hacker protagonist</p>
<p>- Improved gyro aiming and Joy-Con 2 mouse support adds gameplay versatility for both controller and mouse and keyboard players</p>
</blockquote>

              <p>Laptop upgrades don’t always have to break the bank. Even though Black Friday and Cyber Monday are long gone, there are ways to bag some massive discounts on items across a range of categories, including laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">Gamers and creatives looking to upgrade their everyday machine should consider grabbing the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, which is currently available at a whopping 65% discount at Amazon.</a> It would run you around $2,000 on a regular day, but you can grab it today for just $700. That’s similar to what most entry-level options cost these days. This is also the lowest we have seen the laptop drop to in a while, and the deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not. Note that the retailer has listed the discount as a limited-time one, so it’s best to grab it fast. Deals such as this one tend to wrap up quickly, and we’re expecting Amazon to push the price back up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Gamers and Creatives</h2>
<p>IdeaPads are sleek powerhouses. This one, in particular, comes with a full-sized keyboard with a dedicated numeric keypad; comfortable to type longer documents with ease. It’s not backlit, but the keyboard is paired with a bright display that lets you work in any lighting. The 15.3-inch WUXGA IPS screen delivers a brilliant 1920×1200 resolution to bring all your favorite content to life in vibrant detail. The 300 nits of brightness take care of the visibility, while the anti-glare coating makes sure the display is easy on the eyes, whether you’re using it in a dimly lit room or out there in the sun.</p>
<p>There’s also a 720p HD camera with a privacy shutter included, plus digital microphones for better video calls. Audio is taken care of by the built-in dual 2W speakers, meaning you won’t just enjoy stunning visuals, but enjoy better sound for whatever’s playing on the screen, too. Additionally, the battery life is impressive. You can expect it to last a full day for lighter tasks (browsing, streaming), while around 2-4 hours for heavier tasks. When running low, the Rapid Charge Boost gets the machine back up and running in no time. You’ll get an extra 2 hours of usage with just a quick 15-minute top-up.</p>



<p>As for the power, Slim 3 runs on the 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, which smartly combines portability and durability, letting you be productive (plus game) on the go. The 24GB DDR5 SDRAM memory keeps things running smoothly, even during demanding days, which is especially great for multitaskers. You’ll be able to perform a bunch of tasks at the same time without slowing down, whether it’s using different apps simultaneously, gaming with friends, trying to hit deadlines in a short period of time, getting feedback on your creative tasks, using multiple windows side-by-side, and more.</p>
<p>The built-in 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD makes it just as easy to store all your important stuff in a single place. The laptop can house most of your important media files, work documents, creative projects, and programs without a problem. Of course, it’s not massive enough to store entire game libraries, but should be sufficient for casual use. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a wide range of ports to connect peripherals.</p>
<p>All things considered, we recommend the laptop for casual gamers, creatives, work professionals, and even students. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">It’s now down to just $700, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting with this one.</a></p>

As for his future plans, Harada will share more at a later date.</p><p>Here is the full message from Harada on his departure:</p><blockquote><p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</p><p>With the <em>Tekken</em> series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese <a title="Platforms > Arcade [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a> and in small halls and community centers overseas.<br>I still remember carrying <a title="Genres > Arcade [99 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> cabinets by myself, encouraging people to a “Please try <em>Tekken</em>,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p><p>The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</p><p>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.</p><p>And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.</p><p>Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p><p>In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.</p><p>Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”</p><p>During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</p><p>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.</p><p>Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as <em>Summer Lesson</em>), <em>Pokken Tournament</em>, the <em>Soulcalibur</em> series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.</p><p>Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p><p>To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p><p>I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.</p><p>Thank you very much for everything.</p><p><strong>Postscript</strong></p><p>Although I will be leaving the company at the end of 2025, Bandai Namco has asked me to appear at the [<em>Tekken</em>] World Tournament Finals at the end of January 2026, so I expect to attend as a guest.</p><p>For 30 years I kept saying, “I’ll do it someday,” and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event.</p><p>So instead, I will be releasing—for the first and last time—a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60-minute <em>Tekken</em> DJ-style nonstop mix</a> (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement.</p><p>Listening to it brings back many memories.</p><p>Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years.</p></blockquote><p>Bandai Namco also <a href="https://twitter.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178" target="_blank">shared</a> the following message regarding Harada’s departure and the future of the&nbsp;<em>Tekken</em> series:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Regarding the Departure of Katsuhiro Harada</strong></p><p>Katsuhiro Harada, who has long led numerous projects including the <em>Tekken</em> series, will be leaving Bandai Namco. This comes as the <em>Tekken</em> series finishes celebrating its 30th anniversary, a milestone he deeply contributed to as executive director and executive producer on the franchise. Harada-san is making an appearance and meeting with the <em>Tekken</em> community at the “<em>Tekken</em> World Tour 2025 Global Finals” Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) and Top 20 Finals, held in Malmo, Sweden, on January 31 and February 1, 2026.</p><p><strong>Regarding the Future of the <em>Tekken</em> Series</strong></p><p>To our fans, rest assured that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for <em><a title="Games > Tekken 8 [59 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a></em>. We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the <em>Tekken</em> series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide.</p><p>We express our deepest gratitude to Harada-san for providing us with vision and continued success over the years.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/katsuhiro-harada-to-leave-bandai-namco-after-more-than-31-years]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There are well over 200 individual <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>.

Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/">Grow A Garden weather events</a> as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/">Grow A Garden mutations</a>.

The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity. As such, Transcendent rarity plants, such as Crimson Thorns, will seldom ever see a natural restock.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are following the directions in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/">Grow A Garden beginner’s guide</a>, you should try to get Mythical or higher rarity plants to start with, as they’ll give you a good return for your investment. Then it’s a case of getting as many multipliers as possible on them, which many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-pets-tier-list/2900-7008/">best Grow A Garden pets</a> can help you with.</p><p dir="ltr">While the shop used to have tiered stocks dependent on the friendship level with the store owner, Sam, there is now a new Daily Deals tab in its place. This now stocks previously available plants from older updates, which you can buy for a limited time. While they don’t restock on their own, you can spend some Robux to automatically refresh these Daily Deals if you find a plant you want more of. The varieties will change constantly, but have so far included Cauliflower, Brussels Sprout, Green Apple, Avocado, Rafflesia, Banana, and Pineapple, among many others.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_seed_packs">How to get Grow A Garden seed packs</h3><p dir="ltr">Seed packs are another way to get rarer seeds, though which one is up to chance. When you open it, you’ll see a roulette wheel that eventually lands on the seed you’ll get from the pack. Rarer seeds tend to have lower odds.</p><p dir="ltr">You can reliably get some seed packs via the in-game achievements section. Head into the Guide and select the Achievements tab to look at the first segment and find out what you need to do to obtain these packs.</p><p dir="ltr">Another way you can obtain seed packs is to complete the Daily Quests found in the Season Pass tab, which will earn you XP towards progressing to the next level. Rewards include the Prime Seed pack, which you can also buy from the Pass Store tab for 100 Pass Coins whenever they’re in stock.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, there are exclusive seeds and seed packs tied to the current event. You can find out all about how each event works in the central hub area by speaking to the NPCs, and we also have all the info about both the current and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-grow-a-garden-update-and-events/1100-6534922/">next Grow A Garden event</a>. Sometimes they’re available in shops for Sheckles or in-theme currency (such as Candy Corn for the Halloween Market), while other times they’re drops in Chests. These work just like seed packs in almost every way, but can also include rare pets.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997"></a><figcaption>The one place that will always have seeds is the Seed Shop, but it only replenishes some of its stock at any given time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Grow_A_Garden_seeds_you_can_buy">All Grow A Garden seeds you can buy</h2><p dir="ltr">To keep things simple, we will only update this list with the currently available Seeds in the shop at all times. Plenty more have been previously available as part of event shops, including one or two limited-time seeds, but these are tied to their subsequent events. We’ll also omit any Daily Deals seeds as the range changes constantly. It’s better to look for yourself which ones are on offer. Season Pass plants and craftables will be documented here as they’re available for a lot longer.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Seed Name</th><th scope="col">Seed

                <p>Which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward.</p><p>Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>, it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant. Cultivating crops with multiple types can be beneficial in the long run when handling requests during upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-grow-a-garden-update-and-events/1100-6534922/" data-ref-id="1100-6534922">Grow A Garden updates</a>. So, to know which Grow A Garden seeds you should plant in your plot to get prickly plants, here is a list of all the currently included plants of this elusive type.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601052-grow-a-garden-prickly-fruits-list.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601052-grow-a-garden-prickly-fruits-list.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601052"></a><figcaption>The in-game guide has all the Prickly plants listed in order of rarity if you type it in the search bar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601052-grow-a-garden-prickly-fruits-list.jpg"></figure><h2>Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits List</h2><p>There are currently 25 Grow A Garden prickly fruits to find in the game. However, only a handful of them are obtainable right now. This is because many of these were available in exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-seeds-packs/1100-6536143/" data-ref-id="1100-6536143">Grow a Garden seed packs</a> during events earlier in the game’s lifespan. Some have made comebacks via the Daily Deals shop, but many others have not at the time of writing.</p><p>That said, as mentioned in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/" data-ref-id="1100-6535055">Grow A Garden Beginner’s Guide</a>, there are valuable plants you can easily get from the regular seed shop, including two prickly plants that can be worth a lot during the early game. We recommend you try growing the crops with the highest Price-Floor Value so you can expose them to as many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/" data-ref-id="2900-7058">Grow A Garden weather</a> conditions as possible.

            <p>The Maw has once again eaten Edwin. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-next-fest-demo-excess-and-double-fines-sentient-lighthouse">After spending a few days in the news beast's digestive tract back in October</a>, Edwin did implement fresh safety protocols. No petting The Maw. Only feed The Maw using a standard issue six foot news pole. All teeth cleaning must be performed by a qualified animal dentist with a certificate in eldritch care. Sadly, the CCTV camera shows Edwin was fooled by The Maw's gurgles, which sounded suspiciously like 'Can I tell you a secret?'. Edwin proffered his ear, and the cost of his curiosity was to be swallowed whole. We believe he will climb out of the creature's gullet in time to cover The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the proper traditions were observed. Mark played The Last Post on his kazoo, James wiped out the '56' on the 'Days since last accident' whiteboard in the coffee room, and wrote in a '0'. There was a respectful silence, only interrupted by the microwave ping when my porridge was done.</p>
<p>Things should be quietening down as we approach Christmas. That said, there are still some great games on the docket this week.</p>
<h2>Monday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a> sees you trying to earn your freedom from the Underworld by skating all the way to the moon. The main issue is you're made of glass, any slips on the way are mighty deadly.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut</a> is the fleshed out and expanded version of the prequel to Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios infamous Yakuza series. First released on PC in 2018, this embiggened version includes a Red Light Raid multiplayer mode.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597880/Cat_Named_Mojave/">Cat Named Mojave</a> is ideal for anyone who spent last week playing Horses and decided they need a touch more animal-headed, human-bodied horror in their lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3604260/Liminal_City/">Liminal City</a> is for people who played Horses and thought, I would like a nice horror game with no people in at all, please-and-thank-you. (Spider-like creatures that chase you through car parks are, however, in attendance.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/">Death Howl</a> is leaning hard into its deck-building, soulslike genre blending, even putting <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2825880/extras/3133a8ee09c772e865609fe30bbd0a99.avif?t=1765188528">a chart on its Steam Page</a> detailing how it satisfies the criteria of both. Buzz words aside, it looks to be a stylish descent into a wasteland filled with eldritch horrors.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582980/Milanos_Odd_Job_Collection/">Milano's Odd Job Collection</a> is the localised release of Milano no Arubaito, first released in Japan in 1999. If you ever wanted to recreate the experience of childhood labour exploitation, you can earn summer money as a 11-year-old Milano as she steps into the shoes of a fruit picker, nurse, and delivery driver.</li>
<li>Set in a world where music is outlawed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is a rhythm action game where you put on illegal gigs and smash the state. We'll have a review later this week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350190/Anxiety_Puppy/">Anxiety Puppy</a> is a visual novel about dealing with the mounting daily anxieties of living in a city. I'm not sure about the developers' claim that this is a unique theme in gaming, but I'm all for people looking for ways to represent mental health.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/">Ashes of Creation</a> will be opening its MMO world up to early access players this week. The developers are stressing that it will be an alpha world and expect frequent, significant changes to its world. Still, with the ambition to create a world where you can trade, capture, or defend player-developed settlements, it could be a good game to explore in its early days.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>In an appropriate disregard for canonical history, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718460/Terminator_2D_NO_FATE/">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> is a pixel-art game set in and around the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day which ignores the 8-bit movie tie-in game released on the NES and Master System in 1992. Still, 90s game never came to PC, so it may as well not exist – as much fun as riding a motorbike through the LA canals and shooting locks off chainlink gates may have been. The new game recreates scenes from the film and invents new events that took place in the margins of the action. It's basically the Terminator equivalent of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.</p>
<p>While this is a comparatively quiet week for releases. If you're a news glutton similar to our fine Maw, look forward to a veritable feast of stories from tomorrow's Wholesome Snack and Thursday night's Game Awards.</p>

Even though these earbuds are just over a year old, they’re getting a surprisingly steep price cut—making this an ideal moment to grab a pair if you’ve been waiting for a sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">The ANC-enabled AirPods 4 launched at $179, but Amazon currently has them marked down 45%, bringing the price to just $99</a>. That’s a staggering $80 off the original cost. If you prefer add on AppleCare+, the version packed with Apple’s coverage is also discounted down to just $118 (down from $208).</p>
<p data-start="890" data-end="1292">AirPods have been a staple in Apple’s lineup for years, and each generation sees subtle but meaningful refinements. The newest AirPods 4 introduce a sleeker shape with a shorter stem and intuitive quick-press controls for managing your audio. Apple has put an emphasis on all-day comfort in this redesign, aiming to make them easier to wear for longer stretches—whether you’re commuting, working, or relaxing.</p>

<h2 data-start="1294" data-end="1311">Isolate Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1313" data-end="1686">One of the biggest upgrades comes from Apple’s H2 chip, which significantly improves call quality. The chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly, even in loud or crowded environments. Instead of competing with chatter, engine noise, or street sounds, your voice remains front and center.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">That same H2 chip enhances your listening experience as well. Apple’s updated acoustic architecture is designed to deliver richer audio, offering detailed highs and deeper bass for music, podcasts, and videos. The improvements make everyday listening feel more dynamic and polished.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">With active noise cancellation, you can reduce unwanted background noise so you can focus solely on your entertainment or phone call. The H2 chip allows the AirPods 4 to blend together ANC and Transparency Mode. If you start speaking with someone nearby, the AirPods 4 can automatically adjust the volume of what’s playing so you can hold a conversation.</p>


<p data-start="1972" data-end="2365">Another enhancement is the new interaction capabilities with Siri—Apple’s voice assistant. The AirPods 4 can interpret simple head gestures like nodding yes or shaking your head noas responses to Siri’s questions. It’s a futuristic touch, though I’m not sure which is weirder. Someone sitting across from you seeing you blankly nodding and shaking your head, or deadpan whispering “yes” or “no” to seemingly nobody.</p>
<p data-start="2367" data-end="2703">One immediately noticeable change from the previous generation is the charging port. Apple has finally moved away from the proprietary Lightning connector. The AirPods 4 charging case now uses USB-C, aligning with the broader industry standard and making charging more convenient if you already have USB-C cables for your other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2705" data-end="2995" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday now behind us, it is a pleasant surprise to see a deal this strong still available—especially on a newer Apple product.</a> If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your earbuds, the ongoing discount on the AirPods 4 is worth taking advantage of while it lasts.</p>

<p>It's no secret that some of the greatest minds in Japanese game development like to get together to break bread (or knock back a beer or two), but this particular meeting is especially impressive.

<p>Just imagine the kinds of conversations these guys have while sipping back a few beverages! It's enough to make us extremely jealous. How we'd love to be a fly on the wall at these get togethers...</p>
<p>For Sakurai in particular, this will no doubt be one of few instances in which the creator has actually taken some time away from his busy schedule. In addition to creating Kirby Air Riders for the Switch 2, Sakurai also produced dozens of YouTube videos focused on the art of creating games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mikami is hard at work at his new development studio Kamuy Inc., Ueda is working on the untitled 'Project Robot' game, and Suda51 is putting the finishing touches on the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Creator Returns to Work Full-Time at Obsidian Entertainment]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-creator-returns-work-full-time-at-obsidian-entertainment/</link>
            <guid>1375936</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Tim Cain, the veteran game designer known primarily as the original creator of Fallout, has returned to work at Obsidian Entertainment in a full-time capacity.</p>



<p>The announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from his personal YouTube channel</a>, where Cain regularly posts videos about the games industry as a whole. The Fallout creator had gone into 'semi-retirement' in June 2020, after nine years as a full-time employee of Obsidian, during which he worked on South Park: The Stick of Truth, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyranny</a> as a programmer, and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> as its co-director alongside Leonard Boyarsky (whom he previously worked with on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines). Cain also contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which launched just two months ago, but only as a creative consultant.</p>



<p>Now, however, it seems like his early retirement is over, and he's also moved back to Southern California to work in-person at the studio:</p>



<p><em>I should point out that I'm back at Obsidian. I'm their full-time employee and in person, so not remote. I'm not a contractor anymore. This means that I'm not working in other places, although there's at least one game that I worked on that I know is going to ship. I don't know if it'll be next year or the year after, but a game's going to come out that's not an Obsidian game. They'll have my name in the credits because I did work for it for it. There are other games I worked on. I'm not sure they're going to ship. The 2020 to 2025 was a weird time in the industry and a lot of games got started and a lot of games got cancelled. So, I really don't know the status of all the games that I contracted on.</em></p>



<p><em>I also can't talk about the project I'm working on at Obsidian just because, you know, that's covered under NDA. Don't bother guessing. You're not going to guess right.</em></p>



<p>A recent rumor shared by former Obsidian founder Chris Avellone <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-2-but-not-the-outer-worlds-3-reportedly-in-the-making-at-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the studio may not be planning to make a new The Outer Worlds entry, at least for now. That, coupled with the return of Cain, is more than enough to get Fallout: New Vegas fans hyped about the possibility of seeing him team up once more with Leonard Boyarsky (who also worked on the first two Fallout titles) on New Vegas 2 or another Fallout spin-off. However, Cain's tease that fans won't guess right appears to be a nudge that the project is actually a new IP.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's certainly great news that such an esteemed RPG designer, whose credits also include cult classics like Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and The Temple of Elemental Evil (which is about to be re-released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3843520/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, by the way), is back at work on new projects. Obsidian has the ambitious goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-wont-chase-huge-profits-or-grow-aggressively-plans-to-last-100-years-in-the-rpg-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to make great RPGs for the next 100 years</a> without chasing big profits or turning into a massive studio, and Cain's presence will help keep them on the right course.</p>



<p>The team is also looking to satisfy people's hunger for deeper RPGs, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-want-deeper-rpgs-says-the-outer-worlds-2-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while ago by the director of The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and the return of the original Fallout creator will undoubtedly be a boon to that end.</p>
