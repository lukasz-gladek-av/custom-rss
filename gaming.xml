The game's standard edition is $70, which is $10 more than what Borderlands 3 cost at launch, and that makes Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford quite happy. He said on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935048930955563192" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> that he is "so stoked" that publisher 2K decided to not raise the price to $80.</p><p>Some had theorized that Borderlands 4 would follow Mario Kart World in being priced at $80. Microsoft has plans to charge $80 for games as well, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2 later this year. 2K, however, isn't taking a one-size approach to all of its games, as Mafia: The Old Country will be $50 at launch.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 | Official Launch Date Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Pitchford added that he is similarly excited that "we're not doing any paid early access stuff" and that the team moved the game's release date up to September 12. Many modern games unlock early for people who pay extra, but Borderlands 4 isn't taking that approach. As for the release date, Borderlands 4 was originally set to debut on September 23 before moving ahead a few weeks.</p><p>What's more, Pitchford said he's happy that Gearbox is planning lots of post-launch DLC, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">new Vault Hunters coming after launch for a fee.</a></p><p>While Borderlands 4's standard edition is $70, Gearbox is offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">$100, $130, and $150 editions of the game</a> for people who want to pay extra to get more stuff. For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">Borderlands 4 preorder guide.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">more than double the development budget of Borderlands 3</a>, and as mentioned earlier, the game's standard edition costs $10 more than Borderlands 3 did at launch in 2019. With revenue from Borderlands 4's premium edition and DLC sales factored in, the average selling cost of Borderlands 4 at launch may indeed be higher than $70, but final numbers may never be released.</p><p>The Borderlands franchise has sold nearly <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e8841ad4-15c4-4572-b4c4-0df5548df6ba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">93 million copies to date</a>, and Borderlands 3 was 2K's fastest-selling game of all time. It's sold more than 22 million copies, but Borderlands 2 remains the best-selling entry in the series to date with more than 30 million copies sold.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 launch lined up for sometime later.</p>

<p>Oddrock is out and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/say-hello-to-pauline-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline is in</a> (who could have seen that coming?), and you can bring a friend along to play as her. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s co-op options, Bananza will let you sling a remote to somebody else, letting them fire off attacks and pick up collectibles — of which there appear to be <em>hundreds</em> — while you get to all the DK action.</p>
<p>Pauline's vocal blasts can be controlled by the Joy-Con 2's Mouse Mode, to give your aiming some much-needed precision.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, you read that headline correctly. Bananza will support GameShare so you can play with a pal on another system, <em>even</em> if that other system is a Switch 1! Of course, this will only work in Local GameShare (you'll have to both have a Switch 2 if you want to do it online), but it's a cool feature nonetheless. Talk about sharing the love, eh?</p>
<p><em>This is a breaking new story, we'll be updating it with more info shortly...</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

<p>In Donkey Kong Bananza, Pauline is a talented singer who wants to reach the Planet's Core to make her dreams come true.</p>
<p>Her singing voice is an important part of the game, and not just the story, as Pauline can use it to unseal certain items, as well as help guide players to their next location. You can also dress her up, too, which is absolutely adorable.</p>

<p>Pauline's appearance in the game was leaked back in April 2025 thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">key art shared on the official Nintendo Korea website</a>. It was taken down soon after, but if you saw it, the surprise was spoiled.</p>

After fifteen minutes in its company, that feels completely different. This looks like it could be very special. (Jump to 29:30.)</p><p>DK is accompanied on Ingot Isle by Pauline, who, it seems, was trapped inside that purple rock we saw in earlier glimpses of <em>Bananza</em>? Who knows. But the important thing is, the two of them are then free to smash their way around layer after layer of adventure, each level set below the last, until you reach the core of the planet.</p><p>As the video goes on, we learn that DK can pretty much go anywhere at any point, climbing anything, and then also smash through or down any part of the level. It seems you really can bash down just about anything, which will&nbsp;hopefully lead to some excellent videos as people attempt to destroy entire levels. Oh, and he can turn into a zebra and an ostrich?! Amazing. He’s doing all this with the goal of finding Banandium, a precious banana-shaped gem, while also trying to help Pauline return to her non-ape-based reality.</p><p>As <em>Kotaku</em> watched the video, one by one we all declared our astonishment at how much is going on in this game, and how much we want to be playing it. However, like everyone else, we’re going to have to wait a month. The game is out on July 17, with pre-orders open now. Remember, this is a Switch 2 exclusive, and there’s no version for the original Switch. Presumably this was once intended to be a launch title, but needed an extra couple of months.</p><p>This really does look like the big title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">the Switch 2 is desperately lacking</a></span>. This definitely doesn’t look like it’s some sort of stop-gap before the proper <em>Super Mario</em> title, but rather a full-fledged&nbsp;<em>Super Donkey Kong</em> action game to occupy our summer. You know, if it plays as good as it looks. We’ll find out soon.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This turns out to be excellent news for renowned banana fan Donkey Kong, who just happens to be there for this incredible find. However, just before DK can indulge in the gilded treats, a tempest sends him hurtling deeper into the depths of the planet. There, he meets a mysterious new ally in Odd Rock, who turns out to be a talented young singer named Pauline! Together, the pair explore the vast Underground World by smashing, crashing, jumping and singing their way through it. A rollicking adventure you can play solo or in cooperative play with a friend, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> gives you new ways to cut loose and unleash your inner Kong!</p><ul><li><strong>New Ways to Smash and Bash</strong> – As Donkey Kong, you will be able to utilize powerful abilities to smash your way through obstacles and enemies and even unearth discoveries! Use Dive Punch to drill deep into the earth, roll yourself over obstacles, and perform a Hand Slap to help locate hidden items. You can also tear off chunks of ground to either throw at enemies or ride on top of by Turf Surfing and more. These abilities can even be combined for maximum mayhem!</li><li><strong>Bananza Transformations</strong> – While this unlikely duo explores the Underground World, Pauline can enhance Donkey Kong’s destructive ability and even make him temporarily transform through the power of her singing! Collecting gold builds up their Bananergy, which allows Pauline’s singing to activate the transformations, each with its own specialties. Like Kong Bananza, that makes Donkey Kong super strong, Zebra Bananza which makes him faster and lets him dash for short distances and Ostrich Bananza that allows DK to fly and drop Egg Bombs on enemies!</li><li><strong>Cooperative Play</strong> – By sharing a Joy-Con 2 controller, you and a friend can control Donkey Kong and Pauline separately in local cooperative play. Unleash Pauline’s vocal blasts using the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality! You can also use GameShare1 to share the game and play in cooperative play with another player locally even if they don’t have the game themselves and use GameChat to invite friends online to join you via voice or video chat.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_974593"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><ul><li><strong>Race to the Planet Core</strong> – Legend has it, the Planet Core has the ability to grant your heart’s desire, so Donkey Kong and Pauline set off on a quest to reach it. Pauline hopes it will be able to return her to the surface, while Donkey Kong plans to ask it for more (what else?) bananas! Unfortunately, they aren’t the only ones seeking the Planet Core: The Void Company is also <a title="Genres > Racing [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> there for their own nefarious purposes! A villainous mining operation whose reach extends through every layer of the Planet, VoidCo is not only responsible for the banana-stealing maelstrom that sent Donkey Kong hurtling underground in the first place, but they are also responsible for turning Pauline into Odd Rock. As they all dig deeper towards the Planet Core, Donkey Kong and Pauline must do whatever they can to get there first!</li><li><strong>Collectibles</strong> – While you dig your way through the Underground World, you’ll discover useful items to help you along your journey. Uncover golden bananas called Banandium Gems buried behind walls, under the ground, and sometimes right out in the open. Collecting these Banandium Gems earn you Skill Points that increase DK’s power and even allows you to learn new Skills to add to your repertoire. You can also earn Banandium Gems through challenges like timed battles, <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [1,023 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> stages, obstacle courses and more. You will also uncover banana slice-shaped items called Banandium Chips and gold nuggets called Banandium Gold. You can trade Banandium Chips for Banandium Gems at the Chip Exchange and Banandium Gold for useful items at the Stuff Shop. As you dig for these banana-shaped goodies, you may also discover Fossils. If you happen to find one during your excavations, take them to the Style Shops and trade them for different fashions for Donkey Kong and Pauline, almost all of which come with useful extra benefits, as well as fur colors for DK.</li><li><strong>Other New and Familiar Faces</strong> – While uncovering more about the villainous activities of the Void Company, Donkey Kong and Pauline encounter many inhabitants across the Underground World. In addition to the giant Elders, familiar faces like Cranky Kong and his companion Rambi show up as well. You’ll also come face to face with Grumpy Kong, Poppy Kong and others who work for VoidCo leader, Void Kong.</li><li><strong>Getaways and Eelevators</strong> – Need a break? Treat yourself to a Getaway while in the Underground World and sleep in a comfy bed to help restore your energy. You can even choose some music to enjoy while you rest. And if you want to explore areas you’ve already been to with ease, use the Eelevators—subterranean eels that can carry you quickly from layer to layer.</li><li><strong>Creative Game Modes</strong> – Get ready to explore new game modes and ways to play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. This includes Photo Mode, where you can change the in-game camera angle and adjust other settings to snap your ideal pic. And in DK Artist, you can use the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls to take a break from the action and carve designs into stone. You can even change the lighting and add banana effects to give your masterpiece its finishing touches.</li><li><strong>amiibo</strong> – <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> also supports amiibo! A Donkey Kong and Pauline amiibo figure will be available on July 17, and it allows you to unlock Pauline’s in-game Diva Dress early and receive KONG tiles with explosive power. Scan other Donkey Kong character amiibo figures and you will also earn gold KONG tiles. What’s more, if you scan any other available amiibo, you’ll receive a giant sphere of terrain material to aid you on your adventure!</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [204 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on July 17.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

Devil May Cry established the franchise formula with its stylish combat and nearly unstoppable protagonist Dante, while Devil May Cry 3 fleshed out the lore of the series and properly introduced Dante's brother Vergil, who has become a fan-favorite character over the years.</p><p>For <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Devil+May+Cry+Finds+A+New+Home+On+GOG%27s+Preservation+Program&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-18+06%3A14%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-18+06%3A14%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6532525&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdevil_may_cry_4_special_edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdevil-may-cry-finds-a-new-home-on-gog-preservation-program%2F1100-6532525%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition</a>, the changes here are the same as the HD Collection. Released in 2015, this new version of the 2008 game improved it with polished gameplay, new cutscenes, and of course, the option to play as Vergil.

                <p dir="ltr">Look, I respect it. I think it's cool to consistently label the Vault Hunter that's most fun to play across multiple games with the same title of "Siren" so that I and so many others can correctly pick who to play for our first playthrough of whatever the latest Borderlands game is. And who wouldn't want to play as the Siren, the mystic-like class that can warp reality with their mind to support allies or unleash massive destruction? No one, that's who. So, of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>'s resident Siren, Vex, is going to be a blast.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, granted, when I played Borderlands 4 for three hours at a preview event, we were only allowed to try two of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">the four playable Vault Hunters</a>: the aforementioned Vex, and Rafa, the Soldier. "So you don't know for sure then, huh?" I hear you ask. And, sure, maybe the Gravitar or Forge Knight do end up being more fun to play than Vex. I doubt it, though. Lilith, Maya, and Amara are my favorite characters in their respective games, so why would Vex break that trend?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official 18 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Especially since Borderlands 4 clearly does not break trends anywhere else. The latest entry does change things up by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/" data-ref-id="1100-6532503">adding long-requested features</a>, like implementing firearm customization, more types of movement, and quality-of-life features, and replacing auto-healing with healing items. But even if it does play better (a lot better in some cases--healing whenever I want is a game-changer), this still <em>feels </em>like every Borderlands game that came before it. If you have played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands/" data-ref-id="5000-32783">Borderlands</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-2/" data-ref-id="5000-112742">Borderlands 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/" data-ref-id="5000-264457">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-3/" data-ref-id="5000-454301">Borderlands 3</a>, you already know whether you're going to enjoy Borderlands 4. The answer was inside you all along! The trends remain unbroken! Borderlands 4 looks to be a familiar experience that continues to deliver what fans want from the series.</p><p dir="ltr">As GameSpot's resident Borderlands sicko, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I have enjoyed playing the Borderlands games and I would like to continue playing an experience that I have liked in the past. But if you've never liked Borderlands or have fallen out of love with it in recent years, this game isn't likely to suddenly change your mind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516111-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516111" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516111-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516111"></a><figcaption>During the preview, I got to play as both Vex and Rafa.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516111-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The latest game in the sci-fi looter shooter series seems to take cues from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny</a>, putting players into a seamless world that you can sprint, glide, grapple, and hover-bike through, while random event-like encounters pop up, and a round and floating robotic companion points you to your next objective, scans and fixes machines you find, revives you when you die, and digitally constructs your hover-bike. Borderlands 4 is still very clearly a Borderlands game, but I was repeatedly struck by how certain moments of my time with it felt <em>so much</em> like I was suddenly replaying a vanilla version of Bungie's 2014 first-person shooter, just with wildly different narrative trappings.</p><p dir="ltr">Vault Hunters continue to be the core of gameplay, informing your playstyle based on their unique abilities. Vex is primarily a summoner with specialities that allow her to create void apparitions--one gives her a dog-like skag, another lets her create multiple copies of herself, and the last one gives her wings and forms an orb that fires eldritch blasts. Meanwhile, Rafa is geared toward dealing as much damage as possible--his first specialty summons energy blades for him to wade into melee, the second gives him piercing energy lasers, and the third gives him shoulder cannons to fire bombs, bullets, and homing missiles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516112-ss_9817e59ff344dc00aeb154bcdb9820cd89774ad4.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516112" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516112-ss_9817e59ff344dc00aeb154bcdb9820cd89774ad4.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516112"></a><figcaption>I wasn't as big a fan of Rafa.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516112-ss_9817e59ff344dc00aeb154bcdb9820cd89774ad4.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I feel like I've made my point about this clear, but Vex is so much better than Rafa, who doesn't affect how you play the game--he's the general all-rounder who takes what Borderlands is all about (shooting stuff with guns) and does it even better. I understand why he's there. Every Borderlands game has at least one Vault Hunter who is there to fill the role of "soldier" for players who want a more traditional shooter option. I can still think they're not as fun to play, however. Vex, meanwhile, encourages you to play with a strategy, as you need to thoughtfully place summons in key spots and lean into mobility and positioning to account for her poor defensive buffs. I like that, especially as it highlights the new movement mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the last two Vault Hunters, who I didn't get to try, what I most want to see from them is that their abilities have a substantial impact on how I approach a firefight. In my mind, this has always been the most crucial aspect of whether a Vault Hunter is fun to play as, generally, all are built to at least be useful. The ones that are the most fun are the ones that pull you furthest away from just shooting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516113-ss_7d5167fb618abd99e0e076f66963988544467d27.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516113" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516113-ss_7d5167fb618abd99e0e076f66963988544467d27.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516113"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4's other two Vault Hunters are the gravity-controlling Harlowe and axe-wielding Amon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516113-ss_7d5167fb618abd99e0e076f66963988544467d27.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless of your choice, all Vault Hunters benefit from Borderlands 4's faster and deadlier combat. Enemies hit way harder and pursue you more aggressively, and this puts a stronger emphasis on relying on movement and cover in enclosed or narrow spaces. The new traversal mechanics like the double-jump, glide, and grappling hook can make all the difference, and firefights that lean into that dependency are altogether better than anything Borderlands has had so far. There's delightful satisfaction to pulling off trick shots and platforming around the battlefield to keep out of danger and avoid getting cornered, which just aren't present in shootouts in wide-open fields. It takes some getting used to being mobile--and I died plenty of times trying to pull back and be more reserved rather than pressing the offensive and speeding around the battlefield--but once you do, it's a lot of fun.</p><p dir="ltr">It will be interesting to see how movement is incorporated into boss battles, if at all. I got to play through a raid boss a few times, clearing it twice solo before jumping into co-op and doing it again with a partner, and the fight was mostly just circling around a big enemy and shooting it a bunch. This has been a major issue in Borderlands for several games now--the bosses are dull because the difficulty is dictated by a huge health bar, not a test of skill. There's some hope, though. The boss I faced had a second phase where it would occasionally leap onto the ceiling and fill the arena's floor with acid, forcing me to grapple from one descending platform to another while dodging attacks, shooting the boss, and keeping track of which platforms I could grapple to next. It was a brief thrill in an otherwise okay boss fight. I hope other bosses lean more heavily into forcing the player to move around and think about positioning during the fight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516114-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516114" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516114-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516114"></a><figcaption>I was surprised by how many moments in Borderlands 4 now feel like playing vanilla Destiny.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516114-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm not holding my breath, though. This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes. I'm not going to abandon playing as a Siren or ask my friends who are not Borderlands fans to try the game. I know who these games are for: people like me. Is it possible the snippet I played does not at all reflect the full experience? Sure. But I'm guessing it's a pretty accurate snapshot and that Borderlands 4 is yet another game in the franchise that gives you exactly what you're expecting.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on September 12.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> feels like an improvement on its predecessor. The game doesn't chase after trends and instead sticks to the looter-shooter format that the franchise has iterated on for years. It makes for a game that will likely prove popular for long-time fans but, I suspect, won't necessarily convince newcomers to finally give the series a try. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Sirens are still incredibly fun</a>, bosses still take a tremendous amount of bullets to take out, and there are still so, so many different firearms to find.</p><p dir="ltr">After playing Borderlands 4 for about three hours at a preview event, I sat down with senior project producer Anthony Nicholson to talk about the improvements implemented in this latest entry, such as mission replay (so you don't have to start a brand-new save or jump into True Vault Hunter mode just to redo a mission or boss to get better loot), a seamless world, and manual healing kits. Our conversation is detailed below, edited for both brevity and readability.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official 18 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the team hoping to get out of revisiting this series again?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Anthony Nicholson</strong>: Well, I think a lot of it is improving on the systems, the design, and the features that we've had in Borderlands 3 and then the prior games. So what we wanted to do was we knew the kind of things that people were really into whenever it came to Borderlands 3. And then of course in the DLCs, [creative director] Graeme [Timmins] and I were talking about it--I was the head of DLC for Borderlands 3 [and] he was the creative director on the live stuff so we got to listen to a lot of things. We got to see a lot of the improvements and the things that [the team] tried there.</p><p dir="ltr">And there's a lot of things that we've always wanted to do, and technologically we couldn't. But now on Borderlands 4 we're running on Unreal Engine 5. So that allows us to be able to do more of the things like the seamless world to have bigger sprawling zones, to be able to do dynamic events and some of those more random types of events and activities and things that can happen. And so I think [Borderlands 4] really came from a drive of wanting to do things that we have always wanted to do before, like mission replay. That's [a feature] that we've wanted to do since Borderlands 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516141-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516141" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516141-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516141"></a><figcaption>You can now heal whenever you want as long as you have health kits to spare.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516141-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's something I've wanted since Borderlands 2.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: So it's for people like you. There's those types of things. And then there's also the successes that we saw like the movement suite and movement abilities. We think that we can push this a little bit further because people responded so very well to that [in Borderlands 3]. And now in this game, we've added even more to the traversal and to those mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When you're talking about the "seamless world," what exactly does that entail? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: So for us, it means multiple things. It's not just the world, it's not just the map itself. There's no loading when you're transitioning from zone to zone or the big landscape pieces. And so that along with being able to instantaneously spawn a vehicle and just hop on and go wherever you want to, that's seamless.</p><p dir="ltr">You can walk back after you beat a boss [and] pretty much hit a button and the boss respawns. You jump back into the arena and now you're back into it. No quitting to the main menu and dragging your friends, breaking up the party and all those types of things. Matchmaking [has changed] and we [now] let people jump into the game--drop in, drop out co-op--and all of that is seamless.</p><p dir="ltr">And then we're exploring because the landscape is so vast. If you're way on the east side of the Fate Fields and I'm on the west side and I'm like, "Oh, you're doing something cool over there," [I can] open up my map, find where your icon is, hit it, [and] I instantaneously travel to you. That's also seamless.</p><p dir="ltr">So it really means a lot of different things.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516140-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516140-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516140"></a><figcaption>You and a friend can separate by a fairly substantial distance if you want, so long as you're both in the same zone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516140-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Speaking of the co-op, how far apart can teammates get from one another?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: As long as you're in the same zone. So if you're in the Fate Fields and I'm in the Fate Fields, we're on the Fate Fields together on whichever side.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the design philosophy behind changing the auto-heal feature to a button you have to press, creating an incentive to hoard healing items? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: It's another one of those things that we have done in this game to give the ownership of player urgency. Players are a part of cutscenes now. You're a part of it. You're pushing the story forward. You're a part of the growth there. But also whenever you're using a rep kit now you are the one who's determining [when you heal].</p><p dir="ltr">So you can at any point, like you said, know, "I can heal myself when I need to." It's almost a slight cool down. Different manufacturers of the different rep kits have different boosts and stuff like that, but also there's buffs to those because it's like its own piece of gear, just like a shield or ordinance. So you could have a rep kit that increases damage. You could have one that increases fire rate or movement speed, and it's healing you all at the same time. So it really is another way for you to have a tool in your box to build around whatever it is that you want your spec to be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516105-ss_7db66b7fbc823a1e3283b7c969f360c999aaac8d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516105" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516105-ss_7db66b7fbc823a1e3283b7c969f360c999aaac8d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516105"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4 will focus its humor through the banter of the Vault Hunters rather than reference current real-world events.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516105-ss_7db66b7fbc823a1e3283b7c969f360c999aaac8d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Humor is a key part of every Borderlands game. What goes into trying to make a game humorous? Because what's funny today might not be funny a year from now and games are designed so many years prior to actually coming out.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: That's a really good question. All of the points that you say are things that we understand and that we take into the process whenever we're building and planning and developing the story and all the things that we're doing there. So we are really proud of what we've done on the past games, but to your point, those came out at a different time. And we believe that our audience, our community, grows alongside our games, too. So we need to adapt. Things that are happening back then or in the world back then are very different from things that happened now, right?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: [For] Borderlands 1, the development team and the goings on in the world [were] very different from 2025. And so just to your point, we want to make sure that we [reflect] that. But to be clear, [Borderlands 4] is still very humorous. It's just the way that we approach [it] that [has changed]. We now make sure that the Vault Hunters themselves are the ones who are driving [the jokes] and they're the ones who are being [funny]. So when we say [Borderlands 4] has grounded humor, we mean it's more situational comedy between [the Vault Hunters] as opposed to pulling things out from the real world and things like that [like the series used to].</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> has undergone a drastic shift among its leadership, as part of the company's refocus on major IPs like Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/">According to Variety</a>, three studio heads were promoted to senior vice president positions. These include NetherRealm's Shaun Himmerick, Warner Bros. Games New York's Steven Flenory, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>'s Yves Lachance.</p>
<p>Himmerick is now in charge of both Mortal Kombat and DC games, Lachance is handling Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, while Flenory is left with game and publishing technology, customer service, quality assurance and user research.</p>

<p>The trio will now report to Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO of games and global streaming, while all teams under the Warner Bros. umbrella will now be reporting directly to these new vice presidents.</p>
<p>Variety confirmed no layoffs are attached with this shift. This is in stark contrast to Rocksteady, developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and part of the Warner Bros. Discovery collection of studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">which suffered significant layoffs in January 2025</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Warner also recently closed Monolith, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego</a> as part of what the company called a "strategic change in direction". Back in March it was reported by Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">a major expansion to Hogwarts Legacy was cancelled</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> officially got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">its final update earlier this year</a>. Even Mortal Kombat wasn't sheltered from this hardship, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netherrealm-ends-mortal-kombat-1-support-as-focus-shifts-to-the-next-project">suddenly announcing an end to major updates in May</a> despite prior statements from Ed Boon that the game would have a longer life ahead of it.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for future games from Warner Bros. Games? Well we know <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/">a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is coming</a>, a game that proved exceptionally popular for Warner Bros. and a jewel in its crown ever since.</p>
<p>We also saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-thrones-war-for-westeros-is-an-rts-launching-next-year">Game of Thrones: War for Westeros announced at Summer Game Fest</a>, an RTS set to launch next year. These will prove to be the first examples of games created under the umbrella of Warner Bros. Games' new direction, and a tone setter for what's to come. DC Boss James Gunn stated in February he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games">discussing the development of games using the IP with Rocksteady and NetherRealm</a>. Injustice 3, anyone?
</p>
<p>It's clear Warner Bros. Games is in a bad state. Its lack of game releases <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">resulted in a 48 percent drop in game revenue last quarter</a>, and it has unceremoniously kicked hundreds of developers out the door. The company is in desperate need of a win. Whether or not this shift can lead to an end to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-hellish-decade-offers-a-valuable-lesson-to-gamings-power-brokers-sometimes-youve-nobody-to-blame-but-yourselves">what has been a hellish decade</a> for the media giant's gaming aspirations remains to be seen.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><iframe title="NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TD3f0j0ba54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Also referred to as the Warring States period, this was a time of constant turmoil with power-hungry warlords going head-to-head in a bid to expand their territory. Players are thrust into the very heart of this tumultuous conflict, each campaign centred on the rise of a particular clan or the lead up to one of the era’s most decisive battles. Choosing to lead one of the game’s many factions, it’s your job to not only manage domestic affairs, but also military actions, and diplomacy.</p>


<p>If you’re new to the series, then there’s plenty you’ll need to get to grips with. Grand strategy games don’t hold back when it comes to info-dumping and bombarding players with menus and map overlays – <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nobunagas-ambition-awakening">Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening</a> is no exception. These will be even tougher to decipher if you’re not overly familiar with this period of history as you juggle the names of countless clans, officers, and provinces with more than a few tongue twisters.</p>
<p>Even if you know your Akechis from your Ashikagas, the game’s historical exposition can be tough to parse at times. While there’s a predominant focus on your chosen clan and how they interact with their neighbours, Awakening attempts to paint a broader picture of the conflict, interjecting with cutscenes and dialogues that – while important to the overarching Sengoku timeline – tend to indulge in the dramas of other clans who may only play a periphery role in your campaign.</p>


<p>Your main objective – as it always has been in Nobunaga’s Ambition – is the unification of Japan. This requires more than simply sledgehammering your way across the country and subduing rival clans to become Shogun. A good Daimyo will divide their attention between planning military campaigns, negotiating with other warlords, and keeping their own house in check.</p>
<p>One major focus in Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening is the new Dominion feature that was always destined to divide the series’ fanbase. It’s a simple concept, really. To help eliminate a lot of the micromanaging and busywork found in grand strategy titles, Awakening entices players to hand over occupied castles to their retainers, allowing them to manage these territories as they see fit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, your AI officers are more than capable, the Dominion system reflecting the historical reality of Daimyo needing to delegate as they oversee vast territories. By zooming in on the dynamic campaign map, you’ll see farms, mines, and other facilities appear over time without the need to build them yourself. However, this automation doesn’t necessarily make the game any more approachable. Taking tasks off the player’s hands can actually be counterintuitive towards their understanding of how the game works and helping them overcome its steep learning curve. It contrasts the onboarding experience of earlier instalments, namely Sphere of Influence, which offered an engaging (if sometimes exhaustive) tutorial.</p>

<p>Naturally, mouse and keyboard is the optimal way to play, but gamepad controls are dependable enough, allowing you to quickly access actions via a radial menu – as well as select units and sift through menus – with relative ease. The campaign map is also simple to navigate, presenting more detailed information on provinces, counties, and unit movements the closer you zoom in.</p>
<p>Awakening’s battle system has also changed. When two or more officers clash, their unit icons will bump into each other as their troop numbers deplete in real-time, the larger army usually having the advantage as they whittle down their opponent. However, when it comes to key engagements, players can transition to a full 3D battlefield, giving them more direct control. Each map presents a network of pathways units can move along, with control points and other strategic positions to capture, giving your army a morale boost in the process. It’s not a terribly dynamic system, encouraging players to outflank opponents to catch them in a pincer formation while trying not to have the same happen to them. By gauging the stamina of individual units, you can determine who to engage and when, utilising officer abilities to gain temporary combat bonuses or perhaps unload a salvo of bullets into the ranks of a charging enemy.</p>

<p>The presentation does little to capture the cinematic marvel of these epic samurai showdowns. You can zoom in to get a closer look at your troops though battles aren’t as involved as, say, a Total War game. Instead, wars are mostly fought by watching icons move around a campaign map while keeping an eye on their key stats.</p>
<p>Still, Nobunaga’s Ambition Awakening isn’t a drab looking game. There’s a great aesthetic to the massed web of menus, structuring information in a way that is easy to digest while pleasing to look at. Modern, well-spaced layouts spliced with Japanese elegance and Sengoku-era imagery. As always, the music in Nobunaga’s Ambition is a delight and the sheer number of unique officer portraits helps ramp up the immersion even if they’re mostly static, occasionally blurting lines of non-voiced dialogue at one another.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/techland-wants-to-switch-to-a-3-4-year-cycle-starting-with-dying-light-the-beast/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto met with Techland Dying Light Franchise Director Tymon Smektala to discuss the Polish studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the full interview's publication, here's an interesting tidbit: Smektala not only defends the decision to make Dying Light: The Beast a standalone game (it started as a DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human) but also reveals that Techland wishes to release games more often, shortening their average development cycles.</p>
<p><em>I understand why some players might think, 'oh, it started as a small thing and now they charge full price, they just want to sell it as the next game.' But it actually is, it is the return of Kyle Crane. The campaign is comparable to the previous games, and I think it really is the best Dying Light game we have ever made.&nbsp; One day, we realized we had a new game on our hands.</em></p>
<p><em>That realization is also something that we would like to assume moving forward as a developer. Because both Dying Light 1 and 2 took seven years to make. We think that with a slightly different approach, with a bigger focus, we can release games more often. We are probably looking at a three or four year cycle, and I think that Dying Light: The Beast is the first step in that direction.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, when you consider that Dying Light 2: Stay Human <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in February 2022 and Dying Light: The Beast is <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to launch</a> in late August 2025, there's just about three and a half years between the two releases. More importantly, this strategy stands out in stark opposition to regular triple-A development, which is continuously getting longer. Nowadays, the average triple-A game requires five or more years to be properly finished, assuming things don't go very wrong somewhere in the process.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a bold strategy from Techland, though we'll have to play Dying Light: The Beast first before assessing if it can be successfully pulled off. Stay tuned for our full interview with Tymon Smektala, which is going up shortly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/1-4-million-worth-of-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-were-stolen-on-their-way-to-gamestop/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A truck transporting <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> consoles from Nintendo's headquarters in Washington to a GameStop in Texas was robbed before the consoles could complete their journey. The perpetrator(s) stole 2,810 consoles, approximately $1.4 million worth of Switch 2 devices.</p>
<p>The theft was reported while the truck was stopped in Bennett, Colorado, where, according to a local report from <a href="https://www.denver7.com/news/crime/colorado-authorities-investigate-theft-of-nearly-3k-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-from-semi-truck">ABC Denver 7</a>, the driver noticed the semi-truck had been broken into during a pre-drive inspection.</p>
<p>It's currently unknown when the theft happened on the journey from Washington. The semi-truck had been sitting at a truck stop in Bennett called Love's Truck Stop when the driver spotted the theft. The driver also claimed not to know what was in the semi, only that it was games or toys.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The investigation into the theft is still ongoing, but for now, somewhere in the US, there are nearly 3,000 Switch 2 consoles floating around that, unless they're found, Nintendo won't be adding to their total units sold numbers. Anyone who may have tips about the theft is encouraged to call 720-874-8477.</p>
<p>In just the first four days after launch, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">Nintendo Switch 2 sold 3.5 million units</a> globally, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">1.1 million units</a> being sold in the United States alone in the console's first week on the market. The console is flying off the shelves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">selling twice as fast as the original Switch at launch</a>, and in this case, flying out the back of a truck. Even without the nearly 3,000 consoles stolen, the Switch 2 is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">sell upwards of 16 million units in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate for those in Texas who were looking to grab a Switch 2 that they'll have to wait a little longer for a new batch of consoles to arrive, as long as that next batch isn't robbed as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-layoffs-june-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tabletop and gaming giant Hasbro has laid off around 3% of its employees, which amounts to about 150 jobs lost from the company.</p>

<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/hasbro-trims-3-of-workforce-in-cost-cutting-push-2ac88b24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by the Wall Street Journal, which cites a Hasbro spokesperson as saying the layoffs are due to the firm "aligning [its] structure with [its] long-term goals". The Journal says employees "across departments and regions around the world" were affected by the layoffs.</p>

<p>As the WSJ points out, this is part of a wider restructuring effort at Hasbro, which will see the company attempting to cut around $1 billion from its expenditure over the next couple of years. This initiative also saw over a thousand employees lose their jobs at Hasbro <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-layoffs-targets-20-of-workforce-resulting-in-1100-jobs-lost" rel="nofollow">back in December 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hasbro has some big plans for the IPs around which its business is built; throughout 2025, for instance,&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-has-big-plans-for-monopoly-in-2025-including-new-box-and-official-expansions" rel="nofollow">get itself a brand new box</a> and some major new expansions, so the popularity of what is probably the world's most divisive mainstream board game will continue.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Hasbro is looking to expand into new areas with some of its properties as well. Back in February, it was revealed that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">movie based on&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">Magic: The Gathering</a>&nbsp;</em>is on the way, and it'll serve as a collaboration between Hasbro and movie house Legendary Pictures.</p>

These cuts are part of a wider industry trend that has seen many companies let employees go, including industry giants like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, as well as smaller studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">Bossa</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-legend-of-zelda-movie-casting-rumour-would-age-hunter-schafer-out-of-consideration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>New casting rumours have begun doing the rounds for Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda live-action film adaptation, suggesting the possible ages of its lead protagonists.</p>
<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie back in November 2023</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. Following this news, many hoped that Euphoria's Hunter Schafer may land the role of Princess Zelda. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-admits-nintendo-faces-an-extremely-high-hurdle-with-zelda-film">Schafer said it would be "pretty cool" to get the part</a>.</p>

<p>However, the adaptation's latest casting rumours suggest Nintendo is looking for actors between the ages of 16 and 23, at least for both Link and Zelda, which would potentially age Schafer out of consideration (Schafer was born in December 1998, making her 26).</p>
<p>Word of this casting process comes from internet tipster DanielRPK (via <a href="https://zeldauniverse.net/2025/06/17/casting-for-zelda-movie-is-possibly-in-the-works/">ZeldaUniverse</a>), who is perhaps best known for scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies. According to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/131325843">DanielRPK's Patreon account</a>, casting for the roles of Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, Impa, and/or the King of Hyrule could be taking place as we speak. </p>
<p>It's claimed the casting period could be wrapped by the end of August. Meanwhile, the current rumour is that filming for the Zelda adaptation will start sometime this November, with production aiming to then be complete by the following spring.</p>
<p>While we don't yet know which game the film will be adapting, given the ages of the actors they are looking for it is safe to rule out the likes of the very first game, when <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time-3D/Vol-5-Mr-Shigeru-Miyamoto/2-Many-Characters-Many-Roles/2-Many-Characters-Many-Roles-224609.html">Link was around 12 years old</a>. Likewise, according to the <a href="https://amiibo.fandom.com/wiki/Toon_Link_(Super_Smash_Bros.)">amiibo description for Toon Link</a> (as he is often referred to), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">Wind Waker</a>'s Link would have received his green tunic on his 12th birthday.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the film's Link and Zelda are being cast to look more like very young adults, we could perhaps be looking at an adaptation more along the lines of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, in which flashbacks take place around and on <a href="https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Spring_of_Wisdom_(Voice_Memory)">Zelda's seventeenth birthday</a>. An adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>, however, may prove more complicated to adapt, given its time-travelling mechanic.</p>

<p>As for what we do know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the Zelda film</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda film adaptation is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">currently slated for release on 7th May, 2027</a>. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-could-be-the-first-of-a-trilogy">allegedly be the start of a trilogy</a>, planned for release over six years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Put your Switch 2 down for a second, folks, because we are mere minutes away from <em>another</em> Nintendo Direct!</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> that's taking the spotlight for this one, with a 15-minute deep dive into the upcoming adventure swinging into action at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 3pm CEST</strong>.</p>
<p>We still don't know exactly what the showcase will hold, but we feel like Nintendo probably has a secret or two up its sleeve. We've seen a fair amount of Bananza from the reveal Direct, Treehouse footage and our own hands-on time with it at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-rock-surfing-and-boulder-bashing-donkey-kong-bananza-is-brilliantly-bonkers">Switch 2 Experience</a>, but this looks like the kind of game that has <em>a lot</em> packed into it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don't have long to wait until the Direct gets underway. The presentation is being streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (and its regional variants), but you can also watch along with us — and have a good old natter about all the surprises — below.</p>
<p>So, get comfy, grab a banana or two, and let's get ready to rock and roll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/help-us-rank-the-biggest-games-from-summer-of-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">All the big summer presentations are now complete, which means we now have a pretty clear picture as to what games we’ll be playing over the next year or so. Across IGN’s Summer of Gaming we’ve seen plenty of exciting reveals, from the debut of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as part of Summer Game Fest (arriving next February!) to the big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a> trailer during the Xbox Games Showcase (which launches… when it launches.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With more than a dozen presentations held over the last few weeks, there has been at least a little something for everyone. Cozy gamers found games to love among the trailers featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS_nFj3inRw&amp;ab_channel=IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wholesome Direct</a>, fans of the grimdark future got excited about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-returns-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-and-more-all-the-announcements-and-trailers-from-warhammer-skulls-2025">Warhammer Skulls</a>, and first-party devotees feasted on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation’s State of Play</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. But with everything now out in the wild, it’s time for the hard work: to rank the biggest reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve selected the 25 biggest games of the season, based on a multitude of factors (including trailer and page views, social media chatter, and staff excitement) and entered them into a Tier List. Where each of those 25 games sits on the Tier List is up to you. S rank is for the most exciting, D rank is for the games you think show little promise, and then there’s space for everything else in between. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the 25 games are many that have an easy shot at hitting S rank. Resident Evil Requiem proved itself as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming">biggest, most-watched trailer of the season</a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview</a> suggests it's certainly one to watch. And how about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, which looks like a fantastic tag-team fighter as well as a pitch-perfect adaptation of the beloved comics? Then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> with its cinematic first trailer – but will the Bond film vibes be matched by worthy gameplay? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other games are tricker to rank. We finally, after years of waiting, saw Capcom’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, but does it look as exciting as you’d hoped it would? How about the announcement of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced">Silent Hill remake</a>? We’ve not seen a second of it, but it <em>is</em> being developed by Bloober Team, who knocked it out the park with its Silent Hill 2 remake. And then there’s sentient lighthouse simulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>, Double Fine’s long-awaited return, but its debut trailer seemed to keep at least a few cards close to its chest. Where will all these games (and more) rank? It's up to you to decide. </p><div id="summer-of-gaming-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3><h3>Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from IGN's Summer of Gaming, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-anticipated-games-from-summer-of-gaming">most anticipated games of the season</a>, as well as this month's IGN First, which is all about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After over a year in early access, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> is finally gearing up for its full release — which, let's not forget, will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/hades-ii-will-officially-launch-on-switch-2-and-switch-ahead-of-other-consoles">arriving on Switch and Switch 2 ahead of other consoles</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a precise release date for the hotly-anticipated sequel, we should point out, though with the release of the latest early access update, Supergiant Games has teased that it is "getting close" to ver. 1.0 (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-fresh-early-access-update-as-development-finally-approaches-full-release">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>"After more than a year of Early Access development, we're now starting to prepare for our v1.0 launch," the team wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post</a> on Steam. Supergiant says it is "heading into the final phase of Hades II development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches", and it will be sharing more info on the full release "as soon as we can".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As the post suggested there, the new 'Unseen Update' expands the game's core combat, Guardian encounters and character relationships, and gears things up for the introduction of the game's "true ending" — which the dev plans to add before the ver. 1.0 release, fortunately.</p>
<p>All this means that Supergiant is now officially winding down its early access phase. "Our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet," the blog post continues, "and — most importantly — a worthy successor to the original Hades".</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up," the post concludes. "While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades II is still to come, so <em>may moonlight guide us!</em>"</p>
<p>It has felt like a long time coming, but boy are we excited to see what the full release has to offer. We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-hades-2-is-a-hell-of-a-time-even-in-early-access">hands-on</a> with the early access build last year, and we were delighted by what we saw. Heck, if this sequel is even a fraction as compelling as its predecessor, we're going to be in for an almighty time sink when it finally lands on Switch.</p>
