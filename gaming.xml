<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 18, 2026, Quordle is the #1486 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 19.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-developing-another-monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-expansion-similar-to-iceborne"><u>as we learned last week</u></a>, we're also getting the Arch-Tempered Arkveld, 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 — a spin-off series that releases next month — plus an anniversary event where all previous awards and quests will be "re-available."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned last week that Monster Hunter Wilds will welcome a "large-scale" expansion later this year. Addressing fans in a video celebrating the open-world adventure game's first anniversary, series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto teased that this expansion will be similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-world"><u>Monster Hunter World</u></a>'s Iceborne add-on, but was otherwise coy about the details. He did, however, stress that this will be the "final update" for the monster hunting game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds has had something of a bumpy ride. Title Update 4 arrived at the end of last year and ushered in a long list of gameplay and balance changes, as well as CPU/GPU improvements, load reduction, and the optimization of "PC-specific processes and addition of options and presets to reduce processing load." A development roadmap, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sets-out-roadmap-to-improve-performance-on-pc-starting-with-title-update-4"><u>detailed in December</u></a>, outlined plans to address the myriad issues impacting the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that you won't be able to access DLC or play online multiplayer until this update has been installed.

"Some issues have been identified with AMD Radeon drivers versions 25.10.2 and higher on certain PCs using AMD Radeon graphics cards such as the AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT/7800 XT," the team warned.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Full patch notes for Monster Hunter Wilds Ver.1.041.00.00 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Release Date</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Wednesday February 18, 2026 2:30 a.m. UTC (Tuesday February 17, 2026 6:30 p.m. PT)</li><li>Note: Release date and time are subject to change without prior notice.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Required Space (Current Update Only)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>PlayStation5: Approx. 13.0 GB</li><li>Xbox Series X|S: Approx. 16.0 GB</li><li>Steam: Approx. 15.0 GB (With High Resolution Texture Pack: Approx. 18.0 GB total)</li><li>Note: Make sure to have enough additional storage to allow for slight differences in final size.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Major Additions and Changes</strong></h3><strong>Monsters</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– Arch-tempered Arkveld has been added as a permanent Event Quest.</li><li>– New 10★ difficulty quests have been added as permanent event quests for the following monsters: Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad.</li></ul><strong>Player</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– New equipment and pendants have been added.</li></ul><strong>Story Progression</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission "A Royal Request" has been added.

            <p>Crimson Desert will be fully voiced by humans, Pearl Abyss's marketing director has assured in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Speaking with John Paul McDaniel (ItmeJP) and his peers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">the Dropped Frames podcast</a>, marketing director Will Power responded to a question on whether all the voices in upcoming open world action RPG Crimson Desert will be voiced by human beings.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to criticize other games, but all of our voices are done by humans," Power stated. "I'm refraining from saying that 100% of the NPCs have human voices [...] because if that's not the case for even one NPC, I don't want the internet to accuse me of lying. But yes, all the main NPCs and those in side quests have actors' voices. The game features voice acting in different languages."</p>
<p>These languages, as of writing, are English, Korean and Chinese according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/">the game's Steam page</a>, however <a href="https://www.sisaweek.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=228580">previous reporting has claimed that other languages are in the works</a>.</p>
<p>This same interview featured Will Power emphasising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crimson-desert-has-no-microtransactions-at-launch-says-pearl-abyss">Crimson Desert was a "premium experience"</a>, with no microtransactions whatsoever unlike its predecessor Black Desert Online. The game's been drumming up a lot of excitement as of late with its 19th March release date soon approaching.</p><p>It's a wild time to be alive when fully human-voice performances are something that stands out as a positive in an industry grappling with generative AI technology. However, given the positive reception to the lack of microtransactions and this, there's clear appetite for a polished game made with human hands.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> getting a native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version was one of those no-brainers we expected to see as soon as the console launched, yet it took more than a few months to arrive, and when it finally did, it was a mess. What happened there? It's a game from 2011, for Talos' sake.</p>
<p>If you hadn't been keeping track of the recent situation, the Switch 2 port of Skyrim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxhOQsSj6E">arrived in December out of nowhere</a> and promising sharper visuals and stronger performance than its Switch 1 counterpart. The first part was true; Skyrim's Anniversary Edition (the most recent version of the game that comes with plenty of Creation Club content) on Switch 2 was lots sharper and more detailed, landing next to the more recent refreshes of the game and even sporting sharper looks than on handheld PCs due to impressive <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-on-switch-2-ps5-level-visuals-marred-by-input-lag">DLSS implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the game didn't <em>feel </em>good to play. Note how I'm not saying the performance was bad. Input lag is an entirely different thing, and that was the problem. Veteran players instantly noted the massive issue, and <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-suffers-from-kinect-level-input-lag-on-switch-2">Digital Foundry later confirmed everyone's suspicions</a> the game was suffering from terrible delay between pressing buttons and actions happening.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we also wanted a 60 FPS mode for a 2011 game that was already running amazingly well on the Steam Deck and other handheld PCs, but 30 FPS was fine (Skyrim is not a fast-paced game) in exchange for the sharpest portable version of the game we'd seen so far. But you know, put in the work to make it not feel like <em>shite</em> due to unresponsiveness.</p><p>Last month, a quick patch uncapped the framerate, which helped with the overall input lag but felt like a band-aid fix. Plus, resolution and graphical settings were barely altered, so the game never really hit 60 FPS and thus felt wobbly and unstable, especially when Docked, as Switch 2's VRR screen could mask some of its unevenness. <em>Not quite there.</em></p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s Switch 2 port around the corner (24th February), pressure was mounting. How could we be excited for that version of the game when the far simpler Skyrim wasn't running properly? Well, things have changed now, as <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">the just-released 1.2 patch</a> takes a hammer to input lag, stability issues, and overall control awkwardness. More importantly, Performance and Visuals (Quality) modes are now a thing that can be toggled at any time.</p>

</figure>
<p>On paper, the choices are simple: 30 FPS with sharper graphics or 60 FPS with softer visuals due to a lower internal resolution. After spending some time with the game after the patch myself, I can say they work exactly as intended, and even the 30 FPS mode delivers more responsive controls than what we had before. There are bigger differences beyond the resolution cut to hit the sweet 60 FPS line though (see above).</p><p>The most obvious cutback is the one done to object density and LOD details. Like in older versions of the game (or the PC one when you lowered settings), grass draw distance sees the biggest change. When targeting Performance, it'll pop-in a few tens of meters ahead of you, which reminds me of the original versions of the game. Distant details, including NPCs, also feel instantly blurrier, and shadows are chunkier. Moreover, textures are less defined in order to free up resources.</p>
<p>In practice, however, I think most players will agree the game still looks fine and better than its original iterations, and the 60 FPS target is consistently maintained in my experience so far. Whether you play Skyrim in third or first-person, all the aiming and imsim-like interactivity greatly benefits from higher framerates, and going with Performance here feels like the only path forward to me. The 30-FPS Visuals mode is solid now if you can get used to it though, and since these options can be swapped on the fly, I'd recommend it to get the best possible screenshots even if you're going with Performance during normal play.</p>
<p>Overall, Skyrim on Switch 2 finally feels like what we should've gotten back in December, and while there's room for extra improvements and fine-tuning (maybe a Balanced 40 FPS mode for handheld?) in future patches, Bethesda's modern RPG classic is a perfect fit for the system. Bring on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>!</p>

Here's the official overview:</p>



<p><em>This mod is a complete reimagining and expansion of Resident Evil 3 Remake. I’m restoring cut content and adding entirely new locations, expanding the city, and redesigning core gameplay systems to create a darker, more survival-focused experience inspired by the original game. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Features: </strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>New playable locations (city areas, UpTown, Clock Tower, Park, Disused Plant, Cemetery, RPD, and more)</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded and reworked level layouts</em></li>



<li><em>New Nemesis encounters and boss fights</em></li>



<li><em>Redesigned item placement and progression</em></li>



<li><em>New puzzles and mechanics</em></li>



<li><em>Reworked crafting system with multiple new gunpowder types</em></li>



<li><em>Ink Ribbon save system from Resident Evil 2</em></li>
</ul>

<p>As with all these projects, there is no release window in sight, so <strong>it may be a while before it becomes available</strong>. It isn't, however, the first mod of its kind: in 2020, the <strong>Resident Evil 3 Remake Expanded Map Mod</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-3-remake-expanded-map-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slightly expanded the map</a> and allowed more free exploration in the early game, though its scope was much narrower than Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape.</p>



<p>Out of all the Resident Evil remakes, Resident Evil 3 <strong>is definitely the least successful</strong>, having been criticized by critics and fans alike for its short length, a problem made all the more evident after the cuts of locations like the Clock Tower and the Park, which the mod mentioned in this article is attempting to restore. Even so, perhaps "least successful" deserves air quotes, as the game <strong>still managed to reach CAPCOM's Best-Selling Top 10 chart with 10.90 million units sold</strong> as of the most recent update of this quarter.</p>

            <p>
Back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> was announced, we knocked it for offering zappy muzak in place of the TV show’s official theme. Gamexcite and Daedalic have added the theme, now, and I sort of wish they hadn’t. “Help!” I screeched to my bedroom walls, as the rousingly sorrowful opening bars wafted from the speakers like nitrous oxide. “A videogame is making me feel something! It is making me feel like 31 years have passed, and I can still remember Neelix getting drunk on water. I still remember the Doctor’s first words. I still remember blowing up the Caretaker Array rather than using it to insta-warp home.” 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can choose not to blow up the Caretaker Array in Across the Unknown, but I was too chickenshit to witness the consequences of leaving such a device in the hands of the bullying, bouffanted Kazon. That’s not what Janeway would have done, and while Across the Unknown’s Janeway has a certain demon Botox energy, she looks the part closely enough to command my loyalty. Let us go forth, Captain! There’s <em>coffee</em> out there in these nebulae.

<p>
We were a Star Trek/Buffy/Simpsons household back in the 90s, tuning in at 6pm sharp after school to get our fill of phasers, Spike and Moleman, save for those days when the Beeb would stiff us with an episode of Neighbors. While the spectacle of Voyager sliding over gas giant rings remains pristine in my mind, there are definitely a few bits I’ve forgotten. 
</p><p>
For example, I don’t remember Voyager spending this much time hurrying between planets to stock up on Deuterium for the warp engine. I don’t remember the crew losing faith in you if you fail to build a new storage room in time. These are the managerial intricacies they edit out of 30 minute TV episodes, but thanks to the magic of videogames, the one true artform, we are free to sign in exasperation because we can no longer research a new transponder amplifier after running out of juice. Fortunately, power-outs don’t (so far) interfere with your ability to move around and gather resources.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t remember Tom Paris looking this avuncular. Whatever star fitfully smiled upon the conception of this game’s Janeway smirked in contempt when Daedalic gave flesh to nu-Paris. He’s so… sturdy! He still talks like the old Paris, though, which is to say, like a snarky little flyboy, and he’s fared better than Kes, who looks like she’s been dunked in custard. In general, the script approximately matches my memories of the old cast, though it’s a sparser creation with no voice-acting, carried along by dialogue choices that sort of usher you through old plotlines, while occasionally giving you the chance to deviate from canon. I haven’t done much deviating so far, unless you count sabotaging morale by failing to open a new locker room within 30 cycles.
</p>
<p>
Across the Unknown divides your labours as follows. Firstly, you click to scan and move Voyager around procedurally generated star systems, with time paused until you set a course. Secondly, you manage the ship’s interior, a cutaway dollhouse simulation akin to latter-day XCOM base management, with rooms and systems to clear and build according to a resource budget. Thirdly, you send people with different skillsets off on away missions that consist of a series of Choose Your Own Adventure challenges. Fourthly, you autobattle with 3D spaceships, giving Voyager orders that reflect the state of your shields, hull and critical systems, while performing crew special abilities with a cooldown.
</p>
<p>
After an hour mostly spent in the prologue, I wouldn’t call any of this mindblowing. It’s a bog-standard Holodeck recreation of bits of other games. It also makes me newly sad that we’ll never get to play the finished version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumplight-odyssey">Jumplight Odyssey</a>. Still, Across The Unknown doesn’t have any obvious major problems, as yet, and if your memories of the show are copious yet fading, the Proustian euphoria of recognising the specific arrangement of command chairs on the Voyager bridge may convince you to forgive the straightforward moving parts. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across The Unknown</a> is out today on Steam. The demo's still live if you fancy it.

            <p>Rubbing shoulders with factions is a big part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> charm, even if it often devolves into you doing a bunch of favours if you don't want to risk ending up on the vilified naughty list for one too many accidental grenade pickpocktings. You do get some nice perks for keeping the likes of the NCR or Legion on side, but a new mod aims to take that to a new level, letting you send faction cronies out on handy odd jobs while you kick your feet up.</p>

<p>The mod's called '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96429">U_DO_IT - Faction Quest Assigner</a>' and is the work of SkullzyRS, the creator of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3433">a</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2466">number</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4497">of</a> popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> mods. They've recently turned their hands to New Vegas for a project I can't recall off the top of my head as having been done previously in Obsidian's radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.</p>
<p>"I love to roleplay and have always wanted to step into the shoes of NPC man and get someone to do the dirty work for me, so this is the beginning of that idea," the modder wrote in the description of their creation. "The goal would eventually be to get NPCs to actually be able to complete minor or trivial 'go there, get that, bring back' fetch quests for you while you focus on the real and exciting... fetch quests lol, but this is what I have for now as quest editing has been a notoriously bad area to play with in general, so baby steps at the moment."</p><p>In its current form, Faction Quest Assigner adds a command device to your inventory that you can use to send NPCs from eight different Mojave factions out on. These jobs are all done offscreen and range from the likes of patrolling and scavenging to sabotage and assassinations. Once you've picked a job, you pick one of four difficulty tiers to dictate how long the job'll take, what rewards you might net from it, and the percentage chance of your goons failing to complete it.</p>
<p>Naturally, the higher the risk, the higher the reward - often in caps or items, plus a dollop of positive rep with that faction. In order to limit the ability to cheese your way straight into the hearts of every group, these little missions come with a cooldown of three in-game days. Overall, I can certainly see it as the sort of mod I might use to help keep the latter stages of a New Vegas playthrough busy. Sure, by that point I'm usually off DLCing, but it's handy to have ways of making it feel like things are still happening on the war front once you reach the pint when everyone's just waiting for the second battle of Hoover Dam to kick off.</p>
<p>Plus, who could reject the idea of being able to roleplay as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-the-fallout-tv-show-season-2">Fallout TV Show season 2</a>'s Legate Home Alone. Now, if only I can get these cronies to carry me on a big throne...</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-1-041-final-update-full</link>
            <guid>1438993</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, hope you're ready to sit down and focus on one version of the game for a while, because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> just received patch 1.041 - the last patch until the DLC - and it's a pretty hefty one. Buckle up.</p>
<p>This patch, marking one year of the game since launch, makes some pretty big introductions, most notably finally bringing Arch-Tempered Arkveld into the fray, alongside 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, and a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 (which we know launches on 13th March). 
</p>
<p>
Strap in, the full patch notes are below, and they're pretty hefty. The patch weighs in at about 13GB on PlayStation, 16GB on Xbox, and 15GB on Steam.</p>
<h2>Major Additions and Changes</h2>
<h3>Monsters</h3>
<p>– Arch-tempered Arkveld has been added as a permanent Event Quest.
– New 10★ difficulty quests have been added as permanent event quests for the following monsters: Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad.</p>
<h3>Player</h3>
<p>– New equipment and pendants have been added.</p>
<p>– Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission "A Royal Request" has been added. This side mission will become available after reaching HR 9+.
</p><p>– New side mission "Love for a Hero" has been added. This side mission will become available after completing the extra mission "Ghosts Pay No Heed to Tomorrow" and then talking to Nadia and Mina.</p>
<h3>Bases and Facilities</h3>
<p>– Added a new feature to the Melding Pot that allows you to meld Gogma materials.</p>
<p>– Added a new feature that allows you to earn random ingredients at the Ingredient Center after reaching HR 9.
</p>
<p>– New Appraisal Items called "Timeworn Charms" have been added to quest rewards. (No changes have been made to the attributes of Talismans earned. Chances of receiving Talismans with high rarity are increased when using Timeworn Charms.)</p>
<p>– Increased the maximum number of Pop-Up Camps for the Windward Plains, the Scarlet Forest, and the Oilwell Basin. (This will be unlocked by talking to the Pop-up Camp Meowster or the Support Desk after completing the assignment "Germination".)</p>
<p>– Added an option to the Barrel Bowling results screen that allows you to retry immediately. An option has also been added that allows you to use 10 Barrel Bowling Vouchers and receive all rewards at once.</p>
<p>– Adjusted the parameters of the Blossom Barrel Bombs used in Barrel Bowling to behave differently from the Large Barrel Bombs used out in the field. In accordance with this adjustment, new placement patterns have also been added.</p>
<p>– Reduced the waiting time between throws in Barrel Bowling, so that players can throw the second barrel while the results of the first throw are still being displayed.</p>
<h3>System</h3>
<p>– Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</p>
<p>– Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</p>
<p>– Optimized monster and endemic life spawn-time processing to reduce CPU load.</p>
<p>– Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</p>
<p>– Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</p>
<p>– Performed other minor adjustments to lower the overall load.</p>
<p>– The following 9★ event quests have been made permanently available:</p>
<p>– The White Wonder
</p>
<p>– Ultimate Berserker
</p>
<p>– The Monkey King
</p>
<p>– Sovereign Brute
</p>
<p>– There Goes the Neighborhood
</p>
<p>– Added a new special environment quest. (This quest will become available after completing the existing three special environment quests as well as the 10★ Arch-tempered Arkveld event quest.)
</p>
<p>– When quick-accessing "Quest Last Played" on the top screen at the Quest Counter, the default departure point will now be set to the last departure point used. (If the last departure point used is not available, the player will start from the base camp as usual.)
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the display for event quests to make it clearer that the player is offline on the screens for accepting or joining a quest.
</p>
<p>– Added a Refresh button to the search results list for SOS Flare Quests.
</p>
<p>– Added Thai as a text language. Text language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added Latin American Spanish as a voice language. Voice language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added a "Favorited Items Safeguard" feature to the Start Menu options. This will lock the confirm button for specific facilities so that the player cannot use items that are registered as favorites. (Note: This setting can be changed back to "Require Confirmation" on the same options screen.)
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for checking the details before registering an equipment loadout for shared loadouts on the Invitation List screen.
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for going back and forth between the "Upgrade from Box" screen and "Transcending" screen at the Smithy.
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the UI for when the player approaches a Hunting Assistant (Werner or Gemma) in the field, making it easier to distinguish between the positions of Werner or Gemma and their hunting tools.
</p>
<p>– All nine permanent event quests that were only playable online have been made available for offline play as well. (Please refer to the Event Quest schedule for more details.)
</p>
<p>– Heart of Judecca (Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad)
</p>
<p>– Specter of Their Sins (Gogmazios), etc.
</p>
<p>- All 29 event quests that yield equipment materials and that were only available for a limited time have been made permanent and playable offline. (Please refer to the event quest schedule for more details.)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>– Made adjustments that should prevent the Handler from pushing the hunter while out in the field during hunts or exploration. An option to hide them completely during a hunt was also added.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes and Balance Adjustments</h2>
<h3>Bases and Facilities</h3>
<p>– Fixed an issue preventing some pins from being displayed and the score from being tallied correctly if the player throws a barrel right before starting Barrel Bowling.</p>
<h3>Monsters</h3>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the outcome of a turf war between Lagiacrus and Rathalos would differ between players.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where a weak point appeared at the incorrect timing during a Rompopolo's toxic gas attack.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Compact Anti-Wyvern Guns that fall to the ground sometimes wouldn't appear under specific conditions during the Gogmazios quest.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue in Jin Dahaad, Tempered Jin Dahaad, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad quests where, under certain conditions, only the monster would move to the final area, preventing quest progression.</p>
<h3>Player</h3>
<p>– Fixed an issue preventing the correct system messages from being displayed when a skill effect ends due to the player switching weapons.</p>

<p>If you're wondering when the next update for Monster Hunter Wilds is coming, we heard that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-sets-summer-2026-reveal">we're getting a Sunbreak or Iceborne-sized, "large-scale" expansion later this year</a>, with the first news about what that expansion looks like coming in summer. Series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto told us that it'd be a big patch, but other than that, we're in the dark about what it will contain.</p>

<p>Bringing the Highguard website back up is low priority for the developers as they focus on updates and content. </p>



<p>For those unaware, right before we learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-backed-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a> was the “lead financial backer” of Wildlight Entertainment, we were also told the game’s website was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-website-is-currently-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unavailable</a>. Since then, the website has been unavailable, but the developers have finally addressed its status. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-devs-says-website-is-being-transferred-and-simplified">Highguard Devs Says Website is Being “Transferred and Simplified’ </h2>



<p>On the official Highguard <a href="https://discord.gg/euAUhFmZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via Rebs Gaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024041021231739134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>), one of the developers finally addressed the website’s situation. When asked, the developer revealed that the website was down as it was being “transferred and simplified”. They are not sure about the timeframe, as “reputational damage (is) already done,” and are currently focusing on delivering new updates and content to improve the game for players. </p>



<p>The developer was also asked whether the team would refresh the previously communicated roadmap or keep it the same. The dev responded, stating that they doubt the roadmap will be restated, as they need to target player feedback to improve, not just content. However, saying that, the developer also revealed that a “lot of that content still coming out and probably sooner.” The developer in question is a designer on the team who has worked on Wardens, Base Select, Movement, and more aspects of the game. </p>







<p>In other news, the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5v5 Raid Mode</a>&nbsp;has been made permanent.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report has revealed that Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">ill-fated first person shooter Highguard</a>, was funded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> studio group TiMi. The full scope of this funding, its connection if any to recent layoffs, and the reason for its secrecy remains unclear.</p>
<p>The story,<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment"> broken by Stephen Totilo's Game File</a>, emphasizes that Wildlight was and remains "technically independent" from Tencent / TiMi, and notes that Tencent has a public and vast presence in funding Western Game Development. For example, Tencent is a major investor in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">and backed Ubisoft's Vantage Studios subsidiary</a>.</p>
<p>Another example of Tencent investing could be Arrowhead Studios, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent bought up a 15% stake in Arrowhead Games</a> following the release of the hugely popular PvE third person shooter.</p>
<p>However, unlike those aforementioned games, Tencent / TiMi's involvement in Wildlight wasn't publicly announced. You can't, for example, <a href="https://www.timistudios.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#games">see the game listed in the TiMi Studio Group website</a>. Why was this?</p>
<p>Well, Games Business editor in chief Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2023897547136237992">provided some context</a> to how independent studio funding works which could explain the situation. "When a big independent studio forms, they typically go through funding rounds where they ask investors to support their project/studio", Dring posted on X. "Various groups can invest in these rounds. Historically, Tencent has been a regular investor in new teams. You'd be surprised at how many other devs have 'secret' (but not actually secret) Tencent backing.</p><p>"Games require funds to be made. Being backed by investors doesn't make you any less independent. Heck, a lot of the time, the investment isn't even enough to cover everything. Multiple rounds are usually required, and even then it might need a publisher. Tencent, and similar investors, are not a well of money people can keep coming back to. In most cases, it's some funds to get going, and then it's on the developers to deliver the rest."</p>
<p>So, this all may be a lot less exciting than it initially appears. Even so, an interesting peak perhaps into the world of independent studios, how they're funded, and what that means. This report from Game File comes at roughly the same time as the Highguard website was suddenly taken down.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-18-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 18, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Place to visit</li>



<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;On the seaside</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong>&nbsp;wooden walkway in the water</li>

<li>Waterfront</li>



<li>Boardwalk</li>



<li>Boat</li>



<li>Shore</li>

<h2 id="h-today-s-contexto-answer-for-game-1249-on-february-18-2026">Today’s Contexto Answer For Game #1249 On February 18, 2026</h2>



<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>

<p>A pier is a long structure sticking out from land over a waterfront, where people can walk or boats can be docked.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1249">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1249?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 19.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Fails to be Revived by New Season Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-fails-revive-new-season/</link>
            <guid>1438966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently revealed that Battlefield 6’s development team was ‘biting their nails’ in anxiety at the Battlefield 6 roadmap. In a bid to push for a bold resurgence, Battlefield Studios tried to roll out a hefty update for the game’s second season, as well as evolving REDSEC somewhat, but it hasn’t proven to be as much of an adrenaline hit as they wanted.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> season two update was released <strong>yesterday</strong>, and it failed to bring back a considerable enough amount of players to call it a successful content drop. Similarly, viewership failed to increase, suggesting that nobody is interested in <strong>watching </strong>the game, just as much as they are losing interest in playing it.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-continues-to-backslide">Battlefield 6 Continues to Backslide</h2>



<p>When Battlefield 6 dropped in October, it was to a stellar reception that praised the game’s multiplayer platform to no end. The single-player portion was a take-it-or-leave-it delivery, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/redsec/" id="3151">REDSEC</a> turned out to be a fledgling battle royale that failed to make waves, but the multiplayer element of the game felt solid.</p>



<p>Since the game launched, interest has waned as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-studios/" id="2832">Battlefield Studios</a> has watched its player count slowly collapse. There was hope that players would either <strong>return to </strong>Battlefield 6 or <strong>discover </strong>the game with the deployment of the season two update, but that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the player count hit 92,281 as the second season was released. But on a random Sunday afternoon on January 25th, <strong>with no new content drops</strong>, the game hit 97,959 players on the same platform. The game jumped somewhat in the last 24 hours, but not enough to dub the new season a <strong>resurgence</strong>.</p>



<p>For reference, the game reached 747,440 concurrent players upon release in October 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To put this into further perspective, ARC Raiders was released just a couple of weeks <strong>after </strong>Battlefield 6 and had a peak player count of 481,966 users on Steam. In the last 24 hours, it hit a peak of 215,978 users.</p>



<p>We can then turn our attention to viewership, which hasn’t fared much better.</p>



<p>Last year, Battlefield 6 hit a whopping 868,520 concurrent viewers, a peak that few games have managed to achieve over the years. Once upon a time, more than 17,000 streamers were broadcasting Battlefield 6 at the same time.</p>

<p>In the 24 hours that saw the arrival of season two, we saw the peak viewer count jump from about 3,000 users to 27,000, leaving Battlefield 6 as the 75th most-viewed game on Twitch. It’s possible we’d see more growth going into the weekend, which is when around 30% <strong>more people </strong>tend to consume Battlefield content, but it’s unlikely.</p>



<p>Using ARC Raiders as another comparison point, we see the peak of 372,816 viewers at launch holds much firmer with a 24-hour peak of 116,000, which is about typical for Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>It’s not Highguard levels of implosion, but Battlefield 6 players fear the counts will continue to slide as folks lose interest in the game that was designed to recapture the excitement of a floundering franchise.</p>

<p>Remember last September when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a> teamed up with Capcom to promote the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_investigations_collection">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a>?</p>
<p>Well, it's not done with this Ace Attorney collaboration just yet. Following the release of a Miles Edgeworth outfit, developer Innersloth has now taken to social media to announce it's "calling in a defense expert", with the reveal of a free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">Phoenix Wright</a> outfit.</p>
<p>If you log into Among Us <em>before</em> <strong>17th March 2025</strong>, you can receive Phoenix Wright's suit as well as his iconic hair.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, in the Miles Edgeworth crossover, Innersloth released this character's signature grey bangs, red suit, and jabot. You can find out more about this particular update in our previous post here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>This update to Among Us also follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/were-not-getting-a-new-game-but-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-gets-a-free-update">big free update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</a> on the Switch last November.

<p>These updates aren't major ones, but they do include some general fixes for both titles and there's now also Thai language support in Breath of the Wild. As usual, Nintendo says it's addressed several other issues across both games, so if anything else significant is discovered behind the scenes, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652">The Poké Court</a>, a local <em>Pokémon </em>card and collector’s shop in Manhattan, was <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">r</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">obbed at gunpoint back in January</a>. Armed burglars showed up and terrorized guests during the middle of a crowded event. As traumatic as it was, the employees told <em>Kotaku </em>that the broader<em> Pokémon </em>community showed up to support them. Bust as word spread, Nintendo was apparently made aware of the store has since reached out to the owners to…ask them to change their branding.</p> <p>The shop posted on its <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepokecourt/p/DU4J-WtkSNT/">Instagram account</a> that Nintendo reached out with “concerns” about its name and logo, which included the iconic red-and-white Poké Ball.&nbsp;“The short story is Nintendo reached out to us with concerns about our name and logo,” the message read. “This means we’re evolving!”</p>

 <p>As such, the owners have released a statement with a new name and logo. The store will now be called The Trainer Court, and now has replaced the Poké Ball logo with a new one with a stylized “C” for “Court.” Beyond that, the store will continue to offer the same cards, community events, and tournaments. The Trainer Court will also be hosting an event on Pokémon Day, February 27, which commemorates the series’ 30th anniversary.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000669829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669829"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669829">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p>“Above all, we have always been fans of <em>Pokémon</em>,” the statement reads. “We are a group of kids who refuse to grow up, and we spend every day celebrating this franchise that means so much to us.”</p>

 <p>Nintendo has a history of being litigious about fan creations, events, and businesses, whether that be pretty normal stuff like <a href="https://kotaku.com/another-pokemon-fan-game-says-nintendo-shut-them-down-1790360365">fan games</a>, or more unsavory business <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-lawsuit-streamer-2000640438">like piracy</a>. They certainly didn’t step in when the Department of Homeland Security was using the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon </em>theme song&nbsp;to promote ICE, though.</p>

 <p>The Pokémon Company did <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">release a statement to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em></a> confirming it wasn’t involved, but the video is <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">still up on social media</a> and has received over 75 million views on X alone.</p>

              <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710850/Become/"><em>Become</em></a>, the upcoming 3D platformer from indie developer Valentin Wirth, is a bildungsroman with a twist. Instead of a story about a young person’s moral journey through adolescence, it’s a game about a sperm cell’s physical journey to beat millions of others in a race for the ultimate prize: the opportunity to fertilize an egg and create life itself. It’s a tale of survival, growth, ingenuity, and self-reflection set inside the human reproductive system. It’s a bildongsroman, folks.</p> <p>Since its announcement, <em>Become</em> has garnered attention (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-game-become-where-you-play-as-sperm-racing-to-create-life-goes-viral-3319593/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>) for its playful treatment of its subject matter and fun visuals. The game’s trailer opens with text that reads “Deep inside the balls” in a <em>Finding Nemo</em>-coded font, and features sperm cells swimming through lush, undersea-like environs while sporting stylish accessories such as cowboy hats and shark costumes. <em>Become</em>‘s Steam page describes the game as a “short single player, third person adventure” in which you must “learn, adapt, and grow stronger as you explore the fascinating but dangerous microcosm of the human reproductive system.”</p>

  <p>Based on the early build showcased in the trailer, that translates to a skill progression system with evocatively (and provocatively) named upgrades like “Busty Bouncer” and “Got Milk.” We’ll leave it up to you to imagine what bonuses those skills might impart on your lil’ guy.</p> <p>Wirth is a first-time solo developer with credits in the cinematic and art departments for games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-iii-the-kotaku-review-1787722761"><em>Mafia III</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/crime-boss-rockay-city-impressions-bad-terrible-shit-pc-1850297022"><em>Crime Boss: Rockay City</em></a>. <em>Become</em> is set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026, “If I don’t f*ck it up,” Wirth added in the trailer. Hopefully, both the game and the sperm stay on track for release.</p>

<p>Now might be a good time to revisit Skyrim</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="7d72872352d24"><a title="Skyrim" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d72872352d24/skyrim.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> didn't exactly launch in the best state when it arrived on the Switch 2 at the end of last year, but Bethesda is now rolling out patches for the title to improve the overalle experience.</p>
<p>This week sees the arrival of <strong>Update 1.2</strong> for the Switch 2 version of the game. This includes a 60Hz mode, allowing players to prioritise either visuals or performance. The update also locks the frame rate at 30Hz when prioritising visuals, improves FPS drops in certain locations, and fixes a bunch of bugs - including Joy-Con 2 controller problems.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, according to Bethesda's official patch notes (via social media):</p>
<h2><strong>Skyrim Switch 2 Update 1.2 Notes</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added a 60 Hz mode under Display settings that allows players to toggle between “Prioritize Visuals” or “Prioritize Performance”.</em></li>
<li><em>In addition, frame rate has been locked at 30 Hz in “Prioritize Visuals” mode for smoother gameplay.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crashes and Performance Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that occurred when reading “The Crimson Dirks Vol. 4” book for the “Tilted Scales” quest in German.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an audio-related crash.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash, infinite load, and game freeze that sometimes occurred when rapidly selecting “Load” multiple times in the pause menu.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that occurred when the “Transmute Ore” spell was repeatedly cast outside of the Haltered Stream Camp.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved FPS performance drops that occurred in the following locations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>during the Hide and Seek quest in Kynesgrove</em></li>
<li><em>during combat at Secunda’s Kiss</em></li>
<li><em>when discovering the “Drelas’ Cottage” location</em></li>
<li><em>when engaged in combat with a giant at the Talking Stone Camp.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visuals Issues Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Viewing water planes from a distance or within menus caused them to shift up and down.</em></li>
<li><em>Distant aspen trees appeared with a blue tint.</em></li>
<li><em>Transitioning out of caves caused an outline of the entrance to linger during the fade-to-back loading screen.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Interface Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in dialogue or the Help menu, caused different options to be highlighted.</em></li>
<li><em>Switching between mouse and controller mode while in help menus or user hints, did not dynamically update callout prompts.</em></li>
<li><em>The “Ready/Sheathe” option was missing from the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls menu.</em></li>
<li><em>The “Delete” prompt remained grayed-out within the Load menu when swapping between mouse and controller mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Deleting a save in the Save/Load menus reset the highlighted selection to the top of the menu list.</em></li>
<li><em>While in mouse mode, the cursor remained stuck within a smaller section of the screen when changing between docked/undocked modes or interfacing with GameChat.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controls Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The “Eagle Eye” Archery perk remained active after switching between mouse and controller mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Holding down the Right Joystick while reassigning a button caused that button to disappear from the Controls list.</em></li>
<li><em>The Joy-Con 2 controllers provided haptic feedback while in mouse mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Buttons became unresponsive when controls were remapped while moving the Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Rotating the map in mouse mode was slower and less smooth than in controller mode.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audio Issue Fix</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scrolling SFX continued to play while holding up or down on the Left Joystick or buttons at the top or bottom of the Save/Load menus.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Localization Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Amiibo” appeared as plural in Spanish.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added new translations for the features listed above and UI updates.</em></li>

<p>This update follows the release of a patch towards the end of December 2025, which addressed input latency issues.</p>
<p>When we reviewed Skyrim: Anniversary Edition on Switch 2, we called it "hugely disappointing" - mentioning at the time how the title was still running at 30fps and had "awful input lag to boot", so it's great to see updates to the game are slowly improving the overall experience.</p>

<p>If you haven't already jumped into Skyrim on Switch 2, it's a free upgrade for owners of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Anniversary Edition</a> on Switch.</p>

      <p>I may have just been reminded to<a href="https://aftermath.site/master-commander-total-war-rts-strategy/"> <u>never judge a book by its cover</u></a>, but sometimes the cover is so bad that I can't help it.</p><p>A few years back EA Sports and FIFA, who had collaborated for decades on the globe-conquering <em>FIFA </em>series of video games, split. EA now makes its own series, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and FIFA--when not engaging in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:FIFA_controversies?ref=aftermath.site"><u>blatant corruption and cronyism</u></a> with <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2026/02/02/infantino-trump-s-compliant-underling-in-the-lead-up-to-the-2026-world-cup_6750030_23.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>some of the worst people on Earth</u></a>--had to find a new partner if they wanted to make some money in the video game space (which they do, all FIFA cares about is making money, see earlier comments).</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/medieval-iii-total-war-fifa-netflix-delphi-announce/"><div><p>I’m Taking It As A Bad Sign That Two Big Games Were Announced With No Screenshots</p><p>One game overthought it, the other knew exactly what it was doing</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Late last year, it was announced they'd found one! As <a href="https://aftermath.site/medieval-iii-total-war-fifa-netflix-delphi-announce/" rel="noreferrer">I said in December</a>:</p><blockquote>Earlier today Netflix<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix?ref=aftermath.site">&nbsp;<u>announced</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>that Delphi, a company you've likely never heard of (they're relatively new, and their only public credit is as support on IO's upcoming&nbsp;<em>007&nbsp;</em>game) will be both developing and publishing a new FIFA game.</blockquote><p>That was all we knew at the time, but now,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/meet-delphi-interactive-the-publisherdeveloper-behind-the-new-fifa-game?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>courtesy of an interview Delphi recently conducted with GI.biz</u></a>, we know more. And what we know <em>sucks</em>.</p><blockquote>"Delphi has evolved into a full-fledged developer and publisher," [executive producer] Tang-Peronard says. "We believe in a lean, highly experienced core team, supported by best-in-class co-development and outsourcing partners." For FIFA, that includes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.refactorgames.com/?ref=aftermath.site#about">Refactor Games</a>, based at Delphi's LA headquarters, part-owned by Delphi and backed by venture capital giant A16z's Speedrun fund.

The studio employs alumni of VR dev Survios and blockchain dev N3TWORK.</blockquote><p>A16z is Andreessen Horowitz, a terrible company even by venture capital's vampiric standards, <a href="https://www.thedissident.news/the-techno-fascist-soul-of-marc-andreessen/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">run</a> by<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/major-tech-investor-calls-architect-of-fascism-a-saint-in-unhinged-manifesto/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>some of the most overt technofascists</u></a> operating<a href="https://www.tni.org/en/article/the-rise-of-the-techno-tyrants?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>in Silicon Valley today</u></a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Magic: The Gathering Cards Are Winning Me Over With Their Big-Time Video Game Vibes]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tmnt-mtg-commander-leonardo-donatello-shredder-krang-2000669775</link>
            <guid>1438900</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was very skeptical of <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-record-final-fantasy-hasbro-2000668256"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s rapid return</a> to the streets of New York for a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> pizza party. I still am. But the set is full of a surprising amount of love for the franchise’s strong video game roots that has me softening my stance a bit.</p> <p>I’ve seen all of the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> movies, played most of the games, watched a ton of the cartoons, read some of the comics, and played with plenty of action figures. I’m a millennial who was old enough to play <em>Turtles</em> in the arcade, watch them on Saturday mornings, and longingly eye the racks of toys in ’90s department stores. What I’m saying is that, as a frequent <em>MTG</em> enjoyer as well, I’m the perfect mark for a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><em>TMNT</em> Universes Beyond set</a>.</p>

 <p>But I initially greeted news of the expansion with a groan. <em>MTG</em> fatigue has been setting in on a few different levels. We’re not even six months removed from <a href="https://kotaku.com/mtg-spider-man-ff-prices-ebay-preorder-sold-out-1851767413">last year’s New York-centric <em>Spider-Man</em> set</a>, and just a few months away from a <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-horn-greed-heroic-intervention-2000651812">Marvel Super Heroes expansion</a> bringing more Manhattan flavor to the card game. Plus, there’s the rapid pace of new launches. <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> still feels fresh; <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> seems like it just came out yesterday.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000669819" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669819"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669819">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">It’s too much too soon</a>. <em>TMNT</em> releasing on March 6 only adds to the exhaustion. And yet I can already feel myself coming around thanks to the clever ways Wizards is trying to imbue the set with an identity drawn from multiple sources. Some cards are callbacks to the animated series, some use art from the comics, and others play into moments and aesthetics from the most recent <em>TMNT</em> movie, 2023’s<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-video-game-ninja-turtles-movie-date-1850810080">Mutant Mayhem</a></em>. Each era and sensibility gets some special attention.</p>

 <p>Instead of relying on just the characters and conflicts to drive the lore and flavor, the expansion is effectively a multi-decade tribute to a larger pop-culture phenomenon. Different cards will tug at different parts of players’ nostalgia. For me, it’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693/2">video game legacy</a> that has me excited to start ripping packs with friends. The set both calls back to home console and arcade classics and channels that spirit into certain mechanics.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000669821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000669821"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000669821">Wizards</figcaption></figure> <p>First, there’s the borderless pixel art cards which just look really rad. Not only are the characters pixel art but you also get 8-bit-looking color symbols and text box windows. You also have a range of video-game-themed cards like Level Up, which gives you double +1/+1 counters after attacking, and High Score, which lets you draw cards for having the strongest creature on the board. Arcade Cabinet, meanwhile, leans into the +1/+1 counter strategy with a neat four-player nod.</p> <p>Let’s talk about Commander.&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em> introduces a completely novel concept to the popular MTG offshoot: coop. Instead of just one Commander card, you can have two as long as the card has “Partner.” Combine Leonardo and Donatello to create a token +1/+1 counter engine that will make everyone else at the table lose their minds as you try to keep track of your board.</p>

   <p>And then there’s the call-outs to particular <em>TMNT</em> moments unique to the games. Shredder, Shadow Master creates copies of himself like in the arcade game’s final boss fight. The art for Leatherhead, meanwhile, is a riff on the Wild West theme from the alligator’s SNES <em>Turtles In Time</em> appearance. Most iconic of all is a card called Electric Seaweed, a plant wall which will instantly be recognizable and terrifying to everyone who died in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUnn3sXt_Q">bomb-defusing level in the NES game</a>.</p> <p>Wizards is having a lot of fun with this set and getting creative in unexpected ways. There are land cards with pizza art where each slice represents a different color based on the toppings. Dr. Baxter’s Mousers are some of the coolest-looking token creature cards out in a while. Krang, a mythic robot, is a perfect stompy creature, as he should be. Would it have been nice if <em>TMNT</em> was still a few months off? Yes. Would I have loved if we only got one Universes Beyond set per year? Absolutely.</p> <p>But Wizards is giving me everything I would have wanted from a <em>Turtle</em>s set. In the meantime, I’m going to go grab a pie and a two liter and fire up the excellent <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Flood plain, fire risk, black mold, and it's going to fall into the ocean."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has partnered with real estate website Zillow to create Zillow for Warcraft, a goofy Zillow-like website intended to promote the game's new player housing feature with humor, information, and a free in-game item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website, accessible at <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillowforwarcraft.com</a> or <a href="https://zillow.com/warcraft" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillow.com/warcraft</a>, is, to be clear, a goof. At the moment, it doesn't seem to be showing off actual houses built by real players. It instead has a curated selection of both Horde and Alliance homes that seem to be intended more to offer inspiration to players working on their own homes than anything. Besides, it's not like you can actually buy someone else's fully built and decorated house in the game, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website is cute, though. It's got a handful of different housing options on different plots in both the Horde and Alliance neighborhoods to skim through, with humorous descriptions of decor decisions and, frankly, some pretty good ideas that I hadn't really thought of for my own rustic shack. You're guided through the website by Bek'tar Donhammar and Hazyl Fizzlehorn, two fictional Azerothian real estate agents who each have their own profiles with "reviews" from satisfied customers, all rife with in-jokes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main reason you might care to visit the website, though, is to get the free item. If you link your battle.net account, you can get a free "Naturally Elegant Doormat" which will show up in the in-game mail after the fact and become available for use in decorating your house. It's not a bad doormat! Worth the, like, four clicks it takes to get it. Once you have one, you can also buy more copies of it from Tuuran and Gabbi near the Trading Posts in Stormwind and Orgrimmar, in case you want a house just full of mats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps even more delightful than just clicking around on the website though are some of the player reactions to the feature. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/zillow_teams_with_world_of_warcraft_for_player/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> about the announcement, a number of individuals have popped in to offer pleasant snark about the crossover, generally mixed in with commentary about how expensive real-life houses are nowadays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"last sold in ‘88 for 49,000, now going for 449,000, cool cool cool," reads the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5uwst8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top comment by u/Helios420A</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hasn’t had work done since Blackhand was Warchief," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5wmdnm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes u/Thesleek</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Does this mean blackrock will somehow get involved next?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5ux553/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked u/notmyworkaccount5</a>, making a very well-placed pun on BlackRock Inc, the investment company, and Blackrock, the World of Warcraft orc clan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have my doormat, I will proceed to log in and rearrange my living room for the umpteenth time, wasting several hours before finally admitting I will never make anything as magical as the <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/#/homedetails/alliance-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ban'ethil Bohemian</a>, and go back to adding spikes to my roof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Just a few weeks later, developers from Wildlight revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-studio-wildlight-hit-with-layoffs">most of them had been laid off</a>. Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-highguard-developer-reflects-on-disastrous-announcement-and-launch-we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-1">one developer who worked on the game</a> has reflected that Highguard was "turned into a joke from minute one" due to false assumptions made from the TGA trailer, and a number of other high-profile developers have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense">come to its defense</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains unclear how heavily reliant Wildlight was on Tencent, or whether a decision to pull funding was made at some point that led to the mass layoffs. Wildlight's future as a studio also remains unclear, with a studio statement saying that it would retain a "core group of developers" to keep Highguard going. However, the game's <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website went offline</a> earlier today and has yet to be restored, leading some to speculate that the game or even the studio is about to fully shut down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is in a bit of a Schrödinger's cat situation. That's because at the time of writing, the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">official site</a> only shows the shooter's logo, and text that reads "This site is currently unavailable. Please contact support@codethirtytwo.com for assistance," alongside links to its official Discord server and Dwitter page. This, of course, could just be a blip, but even as I'm writing this it's been the case for several hours, and there's not a single word from developer Wildlight about why it's down. So, it is both dead and not dead until someone opens the box.
</p>
<p>
This obviously isn't an immediate confirmation that the game is shutting down, but given that last week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">most of the team was apparently laid off</a>, there is certainly reason to question whether this is that famed writing on the wall you so often hear about. The silence from Wildlight in both the game's Discord server and social pages certainly adds to the writing.
</p>
<p>
Parallel to all of this, a report has emerged from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment">Game File</a> that sheds a tidbit of light on how Highguard came to be. Namely, that the game was predominantly funded by Tencent. It's been unknown up to this point just who funded the game, given Wildlight's proud proclamation of independence.
</p>
<p>
The framing of Wildlight as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-devs-say-it-was-always-the-plan-to-go-dark-after-its-reveal-a-la-apex-legends-launch">indie studio</a> by founder Dusty Welch has been a sticking point for me since the moment I heard it, seeing as prior to the layoffs it was a 100+ person company. To hear a report that Wildlight were funded by a company as massive as Tencent doesn't offer me any sense of vindication, more frustration at the hubris at those at the top to think they can just repeat the success they previously had many years of changing industry trends later.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, here's hoping that those affected by the layoffs end up on their feet, and much the same to those who may or may not be out of work by the end of the week.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skyrim-switch-2-60fps-update-2000669806</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> on Switch 2</a> is looking and playing better after a new update added a much-requested 60FPS mode and plenty of fixes and tweaks to the game.</p> <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">Bethesda shadowdropped the 15-year-old open-world RPG <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. But unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">the last time the company surprise released an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game</a>, the reaction to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 wasn’t positive. Many players were upset over the game’s poor performance, visual glitches, bugs, and bloated install size. Well, Bethesda has fixed some of these problems with a new update out now on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">Bethesda released update 1.2 for <em>Skyrim</em> on the Switch 2</a>. The big news is that this free patch added a 60FPS performance mode. Bethesda has also locked <em>Skyrim</em>‘s framerate to 30FPS when playing in “Prioritize Visuals” mode. Either choice should provide a smoother, more stable experience compared to what <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 played like previously.</p>

 <p>In the patch notes for the update shared online on February 17, Bethesda also dedicated two different sections to addressing fixes made to the game’s performance and visual bugs. This includes improved performance in certain areas, like the Talking Stone giant camp and during combat at Secunda’s Kiss. Issues with water not looking correct from a distance or while in a menu have been fixed, too.</p> <p>While it can be frustrating how often <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">Bethesda seemingly breaks their own classic RPGs with updates and ports</a>, I am happy that the studio seems committed to going back and fixing problems. And hey, if Bethesda doesn’t fix it, at least PC players can rely on talented modders to pick up the slack. Switch 2 and other console players are still at the mercy of Bethesda, though.</p> <hr> <p>Here are the full patch notes for the 1.2 <em>Skyrim</em> update on Switch 2:</p> <div dir="ltr"> <p><span

<h2>Reasons for worry</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thememorycore.com/gamehub-feb-11-2026/">a recent interview with The Memory Core newsletter</a>, GameSir admitted that its primary motivation for releasing a Windows emulation tool was to sell more of its controllers. But GameSir’s controllers aren’t required to use the Android version, which it says was sideloaded on 5 million (primarily Chinese) Android devices even before <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoji.egggame">its official Google Play release in November</a>.</p>

<p>GameHub on Android has also faced controversy for including a number of invasive trackers (which are <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gamehub-lite-3608539/">removed in a community-built Lite version</a>). A GameSir representative told The Memory Core that this was just standard practice in the Chinese market, where there is less sensitivity to such user tracking, and that it has since been removed.</p>
<p>The representative also addressed concerns about reusing open source compatibility code in that interview, saying that its Windows emulator was “developed in-house by GameSir’s core engineering team” with its “own in-house compatibility layer (such as syscall hooks, GameScopeVK, and other technologies), rather than modifications to Wine’s core code.” That said, the representative admitted GameFusion “reference[s] and use UI components from Winlator [an <a href="https://winlator.org/">open source Windows emulation tool for Android</a>]… to maintain ecosystem compatibility and familiarity.”</p>
<p>The compatibility issues and controversial corporate entity involved here probably mean that GameHub for Mac won’t be the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">Valve SteamOS/Proton moment</a> that Apple gamers have been waiting for. Still, it’ll be nice for MacBook owners to have yet another option to play Windows games without needing to run a Windows install.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee and streaming giant Netflix have inked another streaming deal. The tabletop giant has signed global rights for official Ticket to Ride movie and TV shows to the streaming platform, bringing even more potential cinematic board game adaptations.</p><p>According to an official press release, this Ticket to Ride movie and TV deal secures exclusive global rights to adapt the board game series into scripted and unscripted projects across film, TV, and additional formats.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This deal is similar to another one struck by Asmodee and Netflix in October of 2025. That deal secured similar rights to another beloved Asmodee board game franchise, the resource-gathering social game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/netflix-catan-movie-and-tv-rights-secured-bringing-scavenging-and-diplomacy-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan</em></a>.</p><p>The press release confirms the first project under this deal will be an official <em>Ticket to Ride</em> movie. The film will be written by Ben Mekler (<em>Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts)</em> and Chris Amick (<em>Final Space</em>), and producers will include Asmodee's own Darren Kyman, Eric and Kim Tannenbaum, and Jonathan Levine and Gillian Bohrer.&nbsp;</p><p>This deal is another step in Netflix's more recent push for creating content out of recognizable board game IP. It aligns with deals to make streaming material out of the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow"><em>Clue</em></a> and <em>Catan</em>. It's also consistent with already produced tabletop game movies and shows such as <em>Exploding Kittens</em> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Family Pack</em></a>, an adaptation of T<em>he Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em>.</p><p>The Ticket to Ride movie deal with Netflix does raise the question: how would you adapt it. <em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a game where players compete to collect and connect various train routes through major cities, scoring points for completing routes. It's essentially a top-down competitive management experience, which is difficult to express in film which tends to err on human scale struggles.</p><p>There's also the fact that the importance of train routes and railways is very cultural and historical. Do you make it a period piece about the rise of the rail? If so, which country do you center on? Is the tone wondrous, in keeping with the board game's kid friendliness, or a more cynical take? Those are the challenges the screenwriters will need to address one way or another.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/riftbound-origins-review-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70845ca1-ba9b-48fd-ae51-be30d1b4ed06" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em> TCG</a> has now released its second set, expanding the number of Legends from <em>LoL</em> that you can let lead your deck alongside additional new mechanics. In our review of <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>, we'll take a look at some of the new mechanics and how they'll power a deck along with the new <em>Spiritforged </em>keywords and how they shift the battlefield.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>Equipment</h2><p dir="ltr">Equipment is a new type of gear card that has been added to <em>Spiritforged</em>. This Gear has a cost to be played, but then an additional cost to be equipped to your units.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment opens up a whole new level of augmentation in <em>Riftbound </em>letting you take fighters that might have not quite been viable, but give them a chance to have their Might boosted or alter other elements of the card.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment can give a Unit a few more Might to help them on the battlefield, additionally you can have equipment that will turn a Unit into a different type such as a mech. This kind of augmentation is extremely important for decks like the Rumble Champion Deck.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-equipment.jpg?itok=AQSwl3us 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I've gotten lost early on in a number of TCG because of how quickly new elements are added, and how quickly it invalidates any of the older cards. With equipment, not only are all cards getting an upgrade, but the changes that equipment can have on a card also open up a variety of possibilities where cards that wouldn't be viable before are now able to be played.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>New Keywords</h2><p dir="ltr">Five different Keywords have been added with <em>Spiritforged</em>. These expand the kinds of effects that cards will have as you play them, by keywording them they're faster to understand and respond to.</p><p dir="ltr">The first new Keyword is Echo, you'll see these appear on spell cards. The effect of Echo is that you can repeat the effect of a spell by paying an additional cost that's listed on the card. This is an easy way to let a spell have a standard level of effect in the early game, but as you build up more Runes, you're able to unleash more havoc with them as the game goes on.</p><p dir="ltr">In my few games playing with the effect, I loved the versatility of these cards and that by using them at different scales, you could do more or less with your turn. It wasn't a spell that was useful at the beginning of the game, but not impactful by the end of the game, and it also wasn't a card that felt useless in my hand if drawn too early.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-unique.jpg?itok=YVkI-bjN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The second new Keyword is an interesting one, Unique. This card effect means that you can only have a single copy of the card in your deck. This effectively moved what other TCG might call a Restricted list into the Keywording on the card itself. It has the dual effect of meaning a player won't need to know the ins and outs of a ban-list to know if they've built their deck legally, alternatively a card with Unique as a Keyword is certain to immediately catch a player's eye, as they might come up with a strategy to unleash this powerful card.</p><p dir="ltr">The final three new Keywords that were introduced in <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> have to do with the new Equipment type; Quick-Draw, Equip, and Weaponmaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Equip has you simply paying the listed cost to attach a piece of equipment to a Unit, Quick-Draw lets that equipment as a reaction, attaching it to a unit you control immediately. These are keywords that define how to activate and equip your equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">The Weaponmaster Keyword is one that you'll find on Units. This lets you summon a unit and then attach equipment to it immediately, whether it's in your base or attached to a different unit for one recycle less than the cost listed on the card.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-battlegrounds.jpg?itok=9krrPVpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I am a big fan of the equipment mechanic, but also the different speeds you can implement for getting Equipment on the field, and in the hands of your Units. It was also incredibly helpful that, outside of playing and equipping these cards normally, you could either have it react faster with an ability of the equipment or an ability of a Unit. This gives a healthy level of flexibility when building your deck around equipment and how to best get it onto your field.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Has <em>Riftbound </em>Evolved?</h2><p dir="ltr">The aspect of Spiritforged that I think I'm most excited about is that elements have been added to the game, adding powerful but Unique cards and involving equipment to augment your current cards, but overall it hasn't invalidated the <em>Riftbound </em>cards from the initial set.</p><p dir="ltr">So often I watch new TCG sets release where a new set means everything prior is out sped or overpowered by new cards coming out.<em> Riftbound Spiritforged</em> feels like it has instead elevated the whole game, meaning you can take your old deck and make slight changes and bring it into competition with the latest cards instead of having to completely remix your approach to the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> is an evolution of the formula. There are more Legends, and more permutations on how you can approach building a deck with new mechanics, but nothing you previously had is left in the dust.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to continue to play your favorite deck and Legend, you can use this set to introduce Equipment to have them hit harder, or substitute cards in with new abilities without invalidating all of the cards you already own.</p><p dir="ltr">The flip side of this is that there really are so many different Legends with different abilities that if there wasn't a strategy that was previously speaking to you, there probably is now.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest issue I still have with pulling booster packs of Riftbound is how few Runes you receive, and how many Battlegrounds you get instead. Especially when trying to start your initial Rune collection it can be rough to see so few come out of packs.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Riftbound Spritforged was reviewed with cards provided by the publisher</strong></em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

Normally $49.99, you can currently buy the hardcover version for $41.08 (about $9 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metroid-Prime-1-3-Retrospective-Official/dp/1913330273?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMetroid-Prime-1-3-A-Visual-Retrospective-The-Official-Art-and-Making-of-Metroid-Prime-1-3-Hardcover-9781913330279%2F14437707119" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, which is one of the first discounts we’ve seen on the tabletop book.</p><p>Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, Piggyback’s 210-page retrospective is an excellent homage to the last 20 years of <em>Metroid</em>. The book itself resembles a piece of art, stitched-bound in a canvas-like cloth hardcover, with a red embossed outline of the series’ iconic protagonist, Samus Aran. Inside, you’ll find a trove of concept drawings and sketches spanning the entire trilogy — as well as <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> — including detailed illustrations of environments, common enemies, and bosses. It even features concept art that never made it into the final games.</p><p>What really makes the book stand out are the behind-the-scenes stories, however. It touches on everything from Retro Studios’ burnout upon shipping <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em> to insights surrounding Nintendo’s secretive development process. The margin notes from series producer Kensuke Tanabe are especially entertaining, as they reveal design debates from over two decades ago.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDMx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sheena Vasani</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/821108/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective-art-book-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
