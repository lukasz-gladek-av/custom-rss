			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to be the best-looking console version of the game, as it will come with some exclusive features not available on the base console and on Xbox systems.</p>
<p>As confirmed today on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official PlayStation blog</a>, the next entry in the series by Ubisoft, launching later this month, will offer multiple display modes on both base PS5 and PS5 Pro, which will all target 4K resolution via upscaling. Interestingly enough, all display modes will support ray tracing in some capacity, although Performance Mode on the base console will only offer selective ray tracing, which enables ray-traced global illumination in the Hideout. On PlayStation 5 Pro, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will offer extended ray tracing features, which enable ray-traced global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game, in its Fidelity Mode targeting 30 FPS gameplay, and its Balanced Mode targeting 40 FPS.</p>
<p>Together with the new details on Assassin’s Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro display modes, Ubisoft also released 20 minutes of new gameplay footage showcasing Naoe and Yasuke infiltrating Nijo Palace. You can check out the new footage below.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is setting out to be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, as Ubisoft detailed last year during <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">Gamescom.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-ending-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Nexon has announced that it will end support for the game on last-gen consoles later this year.</p>

<p>In a developer livestream held earlier today (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Nexon revealed that the PS4 and Xbox One versions of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down on June 19th, which, as TheGamer points out, is two weeks before the first anniversary of the game's original release.</p>

<p>Nexon says that because the scale of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has "increased" since release, the team is spending "a lot of effort and difficulty" keeping the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game afloat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-giant-robot.jpg?itok=hBZyZa0n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-giant-robot.jpg?itok=T4MjXvUJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The First Descendant</em>'s PS4 and Xbox One versions are going away in June.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer goes on to say that since&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>'s upcoming third season is "a mega season update", the development team wants to focus on "increasing player satisfaction", hence the cessation of PS4 and Xbox One support.</p>

<p>Not only is the game being removed from Sony and Microsoft's last-gen platforms, but you won't be able to continue playing it on those platforms after June 19th, even if you have it downloaded on your system.</p>

<p>However, if you do plan to upgrade to a next-gen console, you'll be pleased to know that&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>supports cross-saves, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off if you play on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>launched to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extremely strong Steam player numbers</a> back in July, but the player count has significantly dwindled since then, with around 8,000 players checking out the game in the last 24 hours. That's not nothing, of course, but it's a far cry from the 264,860 players the game attracted at its peak.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has received a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-update-new-boss-descendants" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, with new bosses, characters, and other goodies being added to the looter-shooter. The latest update adds the valkyrie-esque Serena to the game's roster, as well as new areas, a new weapon, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-first-descendant/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-descendant/9p8fbxkmclwc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're planning to play on consoles, though, I'd plump for the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S if I were you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/625216/magicx-zero-40-handheld-console-nintendo-ds-touchscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/624653/nintendo-japan-support-ending-new-3ds-xl-2ds-repairs">exhausting its supply of DS repair parts</a>, fans of the dual-screen handheld may have another way to play when their original hardware finally dies. The <a href="https://shop.magicx.team/products/magicx-zero-40">MagicX Zero 40</a> is yet another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253993/anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-is-now-available-in-three-new-transparent-colors">handheld emulator</a> but with a peculiar design incorporating a four-inch vertically-oriented 800x480 touchscreen display allowing emulated DS titles to be played like they are on Nintendo’s devices.</p><p>The Zero 40 is expected to be released sometime in April 2025 for around $75, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/this-usd75-handheld-could-be-the-best-way-to-emulate-nintendo-ds-in-2025">according to <em>Time Extension</em></a>. MagicX isn’t as well known as companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">Anbernic</a> that have been making handhelds for years, but the company debuted its first Android-powered gaming device, the <a href="https://shop.magicx.team/products/magicx-mini-28">Mini Zero 28</a>, earlier this year, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXAziPF9YS0">favorable reviews</a>.</p><p>The company is taking a similar approach with the Zero 40 as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/25/5025828/nintendo-2ds-review">Nintendo did with its 2DS</a>, and not just when it comes to skipping 3D. Although all of the folding devices in the DS lineup featured two separate displays, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/08/nintendo_2ds_is_actually_made_with_just_one_screen">2DS used just a single panel</a> that was made to look like two separate screens by the handheld’s plastic casing. That’s likely part of the reason the Zero 40 could launch as comparatively cheap as the 2DS.</p><p>The Zero 40 will be powered by an Allwinner A133P processor paired with 2GB of RAM and a 4,300mAh battery that MagicX says will be good for between five and seven hours of gameplay. Like the Mini Zero 28, the Zero 40 will run Android, although don’t expect the latest version of Google’s mobile OS as the company’s last device shipped with Android 10 a month ago. It will rely on the Drastic emulator for DS titles, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091561/nintendo-lawsuit-fallout-yuzu">made free last March for Android devices</a>.</p><p>Aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/Z7GThb_iobU?feature=shared">MagicX recently sharing a video</a> demonstrating gameplay on the Zero 40, there haven’t been any hands-ons or reviews of the device, so its capabilities aren’t yet known. But the company says it should be able to emulate N64, PSP, and Dreamcast titles, in addition to DS games. It’s nowhere near as powerful as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23923136/ayaneo-flip-ds-kb-handheld-gaming-pc-nintendo-emulation">clamshell Ayaneo Flip</a>, but that DS alternative was priced close to $1,000. If it launches close to $75, the MagicX Zero 40 could fill a void with handheld emulators at a reasonable price.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before you dive in with a friend or loved one, though, here are four things you should know about the game.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Whether you’re playing couch-based or online co-op, you only need to purchase a single copy of <em>Split Fiction</em> for both players to enjoy the experience. If the two of you are both sat on a couch, you can obviously share a screen. However, if you’re a pair playing online, the game’s owner can use a Friend’s Pass to allow their friend to join in free of charge.</p><p>Even better, your Friend’s Pass works cross-platform! This means if you grab the game on PlayStation 5 and your friend has an Xbox Series X, you’re still golden. Same goes for PC! No matter where you like to play your games, <em>Split Fiction</em> is good to go.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Split Fiction</em> isn’t an extraordinarily challenging game, but its difficulty is no doubt a notch above developer Hazelight’s previous title, <em>It Takes Two</em>. There are a lot of segments during the game that require intense focus and quick thinking to overcome, as both players help one another bypass obstacles or defeat enemies.</p><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em>’s checkpoint system is quite generous, and failure rarely puts you back more than a minute’s worth of gameplay. With this in mind, be patient if you’re playing with friends or family who don’t have your killer gaming acumen. With a bit of trial and error, you’ll get past even the most frustrating hangups!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you venture through the sci-fi and fantasy lands thought up by main characters Mio and Zoe, you’ll also encounter quite a few side stories that can be explored.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ creative producer, Jonathan Dumont, has revealed new details about the Claws of Awaji DLC, stating it will feature a ‘spookier’ and ‘different’ vibe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of the release, Dumont shared information about the game’s post-launch content during an interview with <a href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-development-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>. The creative producer stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows Claws of Awaji DLC will act as a “continuation” of the adventure and story of their two protagonists. The DLC will feature a “different vibe, a bit spookier,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a definite ending”, and the Claws of Awaji DLC’s events occur after the “core story of the main game”. This means players will have much to explore after completing the base game, as the DLC will introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10+ hours of additional gameplay</a>. Check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> for Claws of Awaji here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Dumont also discussed the bonus pre-order quest for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Thrown to the Dogs. The creative producer described it as “a simple yet heartfelt side quest,” similar to the side content we saw in AC Odyssey. The quest begins with a beaten-up stray dog at a grave, who takes the protagonists to his former house to uncover some “family secrets,” stated Dumont.&nbsp;</p>

The sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> follows the steps of its predecessor including a brand new protagonist and a large interconnected world! After the events of the first game, the Queen of Light must stop the destruction of the very existence by challenging the Supreme God Chaos while seeking the location of their old nemesis.</p><p><strong>A New Installment in the <em>Aeterna</em> Universe</strong></p><p>The unforeseen consequences after the ending of <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> broke the balance between Light and Darkness. The Queen of Light awakes alone in a changing world at the edge of the void. It’s up to her luminous majesty to find answers and stop the end of all things.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe continues to expand with the highly anticipated sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em>. This time players will take on the role of the other monarch cursed by the will of the Supreme God Chaos., a protagonist featuring new abilities and bearing the responsibility of saving everything that has existed and will exist.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Genres > Action [2,535 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Adventure First and Foremost</strong> – You’ll explore new areas interconnected in a large world map full of secrets, secondary quests, and evils to defeat.

Using our trademark stained glass art and hand drawing, all the settings and graphic elements stand out for their meticulous attention to detail. The music, another of the pillars of the game, will allow you to enjoy from the most epic moments to the most relaxing ones with a sound quality on par with the great titles of the genre.</li><li><strong>Rich Storyline</strong> – The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe uses dialogues, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling that don’t interfere with the player’s progress and the general flow of the game. <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> is no exception and introduces a lot of new details about the franchise’s lore and the secrets behind the curse of the two monarchs.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Teaser and Gameplay Reveal Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Aeterna Lucis - Official Teaser &amp; Gameplay Reveal | The Sequel to Aeterna Noctis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDjIQ89JEGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game’s <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,985 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> Pro enhancements were also detailed. <span id="more-948467"></span></p><div><p>Castles in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> are strongholds, filled with hostile guards, valuable resources, and one precious loot chest. Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.</p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-948467-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4</a></video></p><p>Castles are just one of many activities in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> that you can complete to increase your Knowledge Rank, which gives you access to higher level abilities and upgrades. Completing them will also earn you experience and mastery points, which you can use to directly upgrade Naoe and Yasuke’s abilities. Additionally, Castles are full of resources that you can claim for your hideout. Smaller resource bundles can be picked up manually, while larger stockpiles can be tagged by Naoe and Yasuke to be picked up and delivered to your hideout by scouts at the changing of the seasons.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>■ Naoe <a title="Genres > Stealth [75 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4</a></video></p><p>Our walkthrough begins with Naoe’s stealthy approach at night. After dispatching a perimeter guard with her Hidden Blade, she quickly takes to the rooftops with the help of her grappling hook and begins to scout out nearby patrols. Unlike recent games in the series, in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, you won’t have the ability to call upon an avian ally to scout from the skies for you. Instead, you’ll hold L2 to use the Observe mechanic and focus Naoe or Yasuke’s vision on an enemy / objective / loot to tag it.</p><p>While scouting, Naoe spots a Samurai Daisho, an elite guard that will have to be eliminated to conquer the tenshu and claim its ultimate reward. With her tanto blade equipped, Naoe can double assassinate targets, but the Samurai Daisho’s ample health means she can’t take him out with one hit… yet. Shadows’ gear not only offers distinct stat bonuses but unique engravings that can change your strategy at any moment. In this case, Naoe swaps her headgear to a piece that gives bonus damage on air assassinations—enough to take out the Samurai Daisho in a single blow.</p><p>Further into the castle, Naoe calls for help from one of her recruited allies, Gennojo. He’s able to stun a pair of nearby enemies allowing Naoe to close the gap and take them both out. Gennojo is just one of several recruitable allies that can be called up in the open world for help (fun fact, each ally is summoned with a different bird call). Once those guards are taken out, Naoe uses Eagle Vision to scope out the interior of a nearby building.</p><p>Hostile enemies appear in red in eagle vision, while civilians will cast an orange silhouette. Be warned, however: just because civilians won’t attack you, that doesn’t mean they won’t raise the alarm if they spot you. Thankfully, Naoe is able to utilize a host of new stealth features to avoid detection. She starts by extinguishing a nearby lantern, cloaking herself in darkness. She then uses her grappling hook to pull herself up to the ceiling to avoid a patrol before dropping down and assassinating a second Samurai Daisho through a shoji door with her katana.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Stealth Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4</a></video></p><p>Now, let’s flip to Yasuke as he approaches the palace. Yasuke may be a one-man army in Shadows, but he’s still capable of sneaking around. Without a grappling hook, he uses a nearby low-hanging tree to take to the rooftops before pulling out his bow to silently take out a guard from range. Then, while crouching, he sneaks up on another guard and dispatches him with a brutal assassination with his long katana. It’s not as inconspicuous as a Hidden Blade, but hey, it gets the job done and doesn’t alert anyone else in the area.</p><p>Yasuke’s infiltration takes place during the daytime, so he doesn’t have the benefit of hiding in the shadows that Naoe did, but by sticking to the rooftops and using the geometry of the pitched roofs, he can stay hidden while crawling prone. Here, Yasuke calls upon another ally, Oni-Yuri, a poison specialist who can knock multiple enemies unconscious.</p><p>As he moves into the next courtyard, Yasuke spots a bell tower that can alert the entire tenshu to his presence should he be noticed, but with his bow (or Naoe’s shuriken or kunai), he can disarm the bell tower. Now, it’s time to go loud and make an entrance to take out the final Samurai Daisho. Yasuke starts by shooting a gunpowder barrel with his bow, taking out a nearby guard, before switching out his bow for a massive kanabo club. The hulking weapon’s blows overwhelm the Samurai Daisho, earning Yasuke another mastery point.</p><p><strong>■ Naoe Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4</a></video></p><p>Swapping back to Naoe for a combat approach, we see just how skilled a fighter she can be. This begins by exchanging her stealth gear for a more combat-focused headgear and armor that allows her to vault enemies by sprinting at them and knock them down by sliding into them. Finally, her tanto is replaced with a legendary kusarigama that increases damage to enemies over three meters away. The kusarigama is Naoe’s long range melee weapon, great for crowd control and fighting multiple enemies at once. It also enables Naoe to rush assassinate her targets (rush assassinate is a passive ability that is possible whenever the kusarigama is one of Naoe’s two equipped weapons and does not cost adrenaline to use) by wrapping one end of the kusarigama around them and using it to fling herself forward for the killing blow.</p><p>Once Naoe gets to an elevated position, she realizes that a servant that spotted her earlier has returned with reinforcements. Rather than dealing with them herself, she calls her ally Yaya, a hulking brawler, to take care of them for her. With the reinforcements handled, Naoe is able to use the Observe mechanic to scout out Takahashi Shiro, a member of The Twisted Tree family she’s been tasked to assassinate. This time around, Naoe’s air assassination attempt only does partial damage, meaning she has a fight on her hands. Using a combination of smoke bombs and her kusarigama, she makes quick work of the weaker guards as she dances around Shiro, dismantling his armor before going in for the killing blow. With her target assassinated and the Samurai Daisho eliminated, Naoe is free to scale Nijo Tenshu and open the chest, earning a new legendary armor set for Yasuke. Her run ends with her scaling the tenshu for a synchronization point, using the Observe mechanic to scout our nearby points of interest.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-5" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4?_=5"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4</a></video></p><p>We end the walkthrough with Yasuke’s bread and butter, combat. As with Naoe, it begins with a gear swap as the katana and kanabo are replaced with a naginata and teppo (a single-shot rifle). Yasuke’s last armor was ideal for stealth as it provided a 200% damage bonus to ranged weapons while out of combat. This approach, however, will be loud so he needs a new armor set and thanks to a unique engraving, the new set allows him to parry unblockable attacks (red glowing attacks that can usually only be dodged). The armor pairs especially well with the accompanying helmet which grants 50% damage to the attacker on parry. Not only can Yasuke parry any attack now, but he’ll reflect 50% of that damage back on the attacker.</p><p>It’s not often you can go in “guns blazing” in an <em><a title="Series > Assassin's Creed [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a></em> game, but that’s exactly what Yasuke does, smashing down the door before executing the closest guard with his teppo. With Yasuke’s size comes a certain boldness (he can take and dish out more damage than Naoe in a straight up fight) and he sprints straight through the courtyard to confront Takahashi Shiro. Wielding his naginata and parrying nearly every attack thrown at him, Yasuke quickly dispatches all the guards, and even takes out Shiro without too much difficulty. He may not be the climber that Naoe is, but Yasuke still ascends the tenshu to claim the prized chest and conquer Nijo Palace.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ two distinct heroes offer up dramatically different abilities, weapons, and playstyles, but Naoe and Yasuke are versatile enough to change up their approach, allowing you to sneak or fight on the fly. Smash through the front door or lurk in the shadows for yourself on March 20 when <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launches on PlayStation 5.</p><p><strong>■ <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d for PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></p><p>As the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game built solely for current generation hardware, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> can be played at up to 2160p and 60 frames per second on both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro in Performance mode.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>'s Underlands are stunningly beautiful, but some areas are deceptively dangerous. Throughout the level you'll be faced with the challenge of piranha-infested water, and some of these aren't as easy to cross as they first seem.</p><p>The girls can shapeshift throughout this level. While Mio is safe in her "otter" form--which, if you ask us, looks much more like a lizard, Zoe isn't as lucky. If Zoe enters the water as a human, fairy, or tree, she will quickly become piranha food.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958"></a><figcaption>Wall running can save Zoe from piranhas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png"></figure><p>Some of the safe methods forward aren't very obvious. During the first area of piranha waters there is a short platforming section until you end up stranded on a patch of grass. While Mio can swim through the water, she soon faces a roadblock where Zoe needs to give her some help to life a barrier. At this point, Zoe should wall run on the left-hand wall. Don't worry, we forgot wall running was a thing too.</p><p>If you're struggling to make the distance, try angling Zoe towards the middle of the wall, jump dashing to get as far along as possible, and then wall running before jump dashing to the next platform. From here, Zoe should shapeshift into the tree and use the areas on the wall to grapple from point to point until the next safe platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959"></a><figcaption>Use Zoe's tree form to grapple across water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg"></figure><p>After landing there, you'll see a large rock blocks the way. As the tree, Zoe can lift the rock to allow Mio to get through. Here, Mio should shift into the gorilla form to break the log. When she is in a safe space, Zoe should let go of the giant rock which will fly forward and break through the barrier.</p><p>After a short cutscene, the two need to forge forward once more. Complete the platforming section until you find yourself looking over a large ledge to a round pool of water. Zoe can turn into a fairy and fly across the water to the flower stream which will carry her across the water to safety. As her gorilla form, Mio should use the pink leaves to swing across to the water and then quickly shift into her otter form as she drops to the water. Here, she can safely swim through a gap in the rocks underwater.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960"></a><figcaption>Some sections require quick shapeshifting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg"></figure><p>The next piranha waters are shortly afterwards. Zoe will need to use the grapples on the left wall before quickly shifting into her fairy form to fly towards the flower streams that will carry her to safety. Mio can use the same grapples before turning into her otter form in midair and swimming to the next section.</p><p>After yet more platforming and a puzzle sequence, Zoe and Mio find more piranha-infested waters. Here, Mio will need to transport a large plant stalk that Zoe is clinging to in order to save her from the waters, as well as some new contenders: flesh-eating flowers. To begin, Zoe just needs to slide up and down the stalk to remain out of the flowers' reach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961"></a><figcaption>Another important wall running section</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg"></figure><p>When they reach the platform, Zoe needs to go on to it and turn into her tree form. By grappling the flower bud on the wall, she can make the flowers on the wall retract, meaning that Mio is free to transport the stalk through to the next section, and Zoe can transform into her fairy form to quickly fly through and rejoin the stalk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962"></a><figcaption>Not all stalks will float for long</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg"></figure><p>In the next area, Mio needs to drag the stalk close to the flowers on the right so that Zoe can grapple across them and attach to the second stalk that's already waiting there. This pole will quickly begin to sink in the water, so Mio needs to swim around and bring the first stalk with her for Zoe to attach to.</p><p>That's all of the piranha water sections in the Underlands and how to safely navigate them. Along the path forward on the right you'll find the next Split Fiction side story, so be sure to complete that before moving on.

                <p>The Kickstarter for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-ref-id="5000-620867">The Sinking City 2</a> has gone live, and Frogwares has shown off a sneak peek at the game with a deep dive into its current state of development. The studio says that it'll be using crowdfunding to help create a safety net for the developer, as well as use the funds to secure additional features for the game. Currently, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1741196058798550&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kZebdK01qp7eWnGCKfScR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frogwares is aiming to secure $105,000 in funding</a>, and similar to its previous Kickstarter campaign for Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, it'll offer various rewards to backers if certain goals are met.</p><p><span>This new campaign is launching during a dangerous time for the studio and Ukraine, as three years on, Russia's invasion of the country is still ongoing. "After three years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy," Frogwares CEO Wael Amr said in a press release.</span></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0mNkrXHJc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jN0mNkrXHJc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we've decided to take the same route as before."</p><p>For The Sinking City 2, Frogwares says players can expect a "horror-first" approach, with the gameplay being built around pillars of combat and exploration. The game will feature a Lovecraftian influence once again, as players will venture into the decaying city of Arkham, scrounge for limited resources, and solve various cases inside of a morally grey world that features an expanded Cthulu mythos.</p><p>"We're not ditching our investigation roots entirely but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow," Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan added. "We've placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional."</p><p>It has been a long road for the sequel to 2019's The Sinking City, as several years back, Frogwares was involved in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nacon-fires-back-at-the-sinking-city-dev-over-games-sale-on-steam/1100-6488264/">infamous dispute with publisher Nacon</a> regarding ownership over the game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sinking-city-2-goes-from-mystery-to-full-horror-in-reveal-trailer/1100-6521650/">The Sinking City 2 was officially unveiled in March 2024</a>, and while it doesn't have a concrete release date yet, it will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

These optimizations include a visual improvement to Human Torch's Lord Proficiency avatar reward and a new voice-enhancement setting for in-game chat. But arguably the best optimization is the addition of a new feature that allows players to report other players who ditch matches before they're over. As of the latest patch, players can now report bad sports via the in-game menu while still in a match, which is a definite win for players who are tired of witnessing un-hero-like behavior and poor sportsmanship.</p><p dir="ltr">The new update also squashes some hero-based bugs. Players who are hit by Human Torch's Flaming Meteor ability will no longer find themselves trapped inside of walls, and Loki's UI no longer disappears when he takes on the form of other heroes. An issue with Loki's Regeneration Domains working incorrectly has also been resolved, and his sister Hela will no longer be haphazardly launched into the air after triggering her Goddess of Death ultimate ability.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the aforementioned new limited-time in-game activity--the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure Event--the game's developers haven't shared too many details on what the event itself will consist of. What we do know is that players who complete the event will be able to earn Black Widow's "Mrs. Barnes" series costume rewards, free of charge. Devs also shared that the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure Event will begin on Friday, March 7 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET and end on Friday, April 11 at 1:59 AM PT / 4:59 AM ET. Players will likely need to complete a series of in-game challenges to unlock the cosmetic rewards, but given the lack of details in the patch notes, it's possible the event may consist of other activities as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The real star of the latest Marvel Rivals update is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-event-will-let-you-unleash-chaos-as-an-entire-team-of-cloned-heroes/1100-6529857/">new game mode called Clone Rumble</a>. Clone Rumble is exactly what it sounds like: A game mode that allows players to form a team consisting entirely of the same hero. It's looking like Clone Rumble is a limited-time mode, as NetEase included a Clone Rumble schedule in the patch notes. Clone Rumble mode will be available during the following dates and times:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 7 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET - Monday, March 10 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 14 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET - Monday, March 17 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 21 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET - Monday, March 24 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li></ul><p>Keep scrolling for a detailed look at the version 20250307 patch notes (which are listed in full below) or check them out via <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow ">the official Marvel Rivals website</a>.</p><h2>Patch Notes</h2><h3>Optimizations</h3><p>1. Improved the Human Torch's Lord Proficiency avatar reward.</p><p>2. Added a voice enhancement setting for the microphone.</p><p>3. You can now report those who leave matches prematurely via the menu while still in a match.</p><h3>Fixes</h3><h4>All Platforms</h4><h4>General</h4><p>1. Fixed an issue where switching from a Proficiency Deluxe Avatar back to the standard Avatar required a re-login to take effect.</p><p>2. Resolved an issue where other players viewing a career profile would not immediately see the latest scores added after reaching maximum proficiency with a hero. A re-login was required for the changes to take effect.</p><p>3. Corrected the blocklist full notification, which mistakenly stated that the friends list was full.</p><h4>Maps and Modes</h4><p>1. Fixed several terrain issues that could cause characters to become stuck or clip into strange areas.</p><p>2. Resolved various problems with broken collisions, floating objects, etc.</p><p>3. Addressed multiple map sound effect issues.</p><h4>Heroes</h4><p>1. Loki's Disappearing Act: Fixed an issue where Loki's UI would vanish after he transformed. The God of Mischief can now keep his tricks visible!</p><p>2. Human Torch's Meteor Mishap: Resolved a glitch where the Human Torch's Flaming Meteor ability could sometimes trap hit enemies inside walls. Now, foes will feel the burn, not the barrier!</p><p>3. Persistent Pyro-Prison: Fixed an issue that the Human Torch's Pyro-Prison wouldn't promptly disappear upon his defeat. No more lingering flames!</p><p>4. Loki's Blessing Blunder: Fixed a problem where if Loki and his doppelganger placed Regeneration Domains that overlapped and Loki walked over the overlapped area, then back into his own Regeneration Domain, it would lose its healing effect. Now, the trickster can heal without a hitch!</p><p>5. Punisher's Missile Mayhem: Addressed a rare issue where the Punisher's Ultimate Ability would sometimes continue to detect enemies and fire missiles during network disruptions. The Punisher's firepower is now accurate, even in chaos!</p><p>6. Hela's Knockback Kinks: Resolved an inconsistency where Hela would sometimes be launched up after unleashing her Ultimate Ability. The Goddess of Death will now fly firm to rain destruction her foes!</p><p>7. Wolverine's Leap of Faith: Fixed a quirk where characters launched up by Wolverine's Ultimate Ability would sometimes exhibit exaggerated jumping abilities. The mutant's effect is now properly contained!</p><p>8. Jeff's Ice Surprise: Corrected a bug where when the Team-Up Ability is active, Jeff the Land Shark could launch Frozen Spitballs that exceed expectations via certain actions. The aquatic cutie's attacks are now as intended!</p><p>9. Hela's Vehicle Visibility: Fixed an issue where after Hela releases her Ultimate Ability, sometimes she may not be immediately detected when near the mission vehicle. Now her presence will be felt.</p><p>10.

The hero's energy is now properly restored!</p><p>11. Peni Parker's Positioning Predicament: Fixed a positioning issue that could sometimes occur when Peni was hit by Namor's Ultimate Ability. The mech pilot is now perfectly aligned for battle!</p><h4>PC</h4><p>1. Fixed an issue where some graphics cards couldn't enable Intel XeSS.</p><h4>Console</h4><p>1. Fixed an issue where after modifying the mapping of the controller's L3 button, the chat window could not be opened on the results screen.</p><p>2. Resolved a rare issue on PlayStation where Wolverine's Rage Uncaged trophy sometimes wouldn't unlock.</p>

Their scrappy multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) was taking off, but a few hours south in Anaheim, Blizzard was preparing to launch </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starcraft II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a blockbuster PC strategy game that could eat up their audience and smother </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> before it had a chance to explode. It was an inflection point for the studio and game industry as a whole. Both companies were asking the same fundamental question: "what do players want from online games?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Things worked out fine for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. 16 years after launch, it's still logging millions of daily average players and driving millions in revenue for Riot Games, which has since spun up other titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teamfight Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valorant</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and is about to dive into the tag-team fighting game genre with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/">2XKO</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, the company—and the game industry as a whole—are asking that question again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot has changed in those 16 years. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/riot-games-100-million-gender-discrimination-settlement-granted-preliminary-approval">Riot Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-settles-california-discrimination-suit-for-54-million">Blizzard Entertainment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had to grow up. Both have settled lawsuits with the California Civil Rights Department over allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace, and both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-staff-to-solve-challenges-and-build-for-the-future-">have laid</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-microsoft-follows-activision-blizzard-merger-with-1-900-layoffs">workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the face of rising production costs and plateauing player spending.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players have aged, meaning many can't commit as much time or physical effort into mastering their favorite champions. Younger players, raised on a feast of survival crafting games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or social UGC games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, have different tastes. And as studio co-founder and chief product officer Marc Merrill pointed out to Game Developer in a conversation at DICE 2025, audience expectations for what are now called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">live service games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" are higher than ever, raising the stakes for projects that sometimes require hundreds of millions of dollars to get off the ground.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how does the company move forward? Merrill said Riot is eyeing at the "social interactions" that are driving conversation about online games of late, but it's also sticking to its original strategy: converting players into people who say "I play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," instead of "I play video games."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="2XKO"><span>2XKO</span>'s social lobby will be key to its success</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike MOBAs or tactical first-person shooters, fighting games have survived and thrived since the arcade eras thanks to robust, often player-driven meetups where players cheer each other on (or throw around trash talk) in real life. Riot has a history of spinning up esports events, but Merrill acknowledged meeting this community where it lives will require a more different approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But a more interesting question was this: while Riot's publishing arms get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in front of players, how will the development team help players socialize online? The answer is in the game's pre-match lobby. As the company's revealed in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcement/whats-in-2xko-alpha-lab/">its closed alpha tests,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players spend time between matches not staring at a matchmaking screen, but navigating a digital arcade using customizable avatars.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-WiTEnvhilw?si=wsYrsv2KLgRnBlIV" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riot's not the first to roll out a feature like this. Capcom's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Street Fighter VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a similar lobby feature. But in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s case you can see the groundwork for what you might call a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-ification" of online spaces. Emotes, character skins, the ability to just run around in circles next to your friends (making it a space for players who might just want to relax and chat with pals instead of square up for matches).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players in the lobby can even walk over to other arcade cabinets to peer at games in progress—certainly a more engaging way to spectate other games without navigating menus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riot's been experimenting with its pre-game lobby design for several years, going so far as to update the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launcher to allow players to pre-select what roles they'd like to play before entering a lobby—a significant move that cemented the fixed roles players take on in League matches (top lane, mid lane, "jungler," etc.).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an effective menu, but it's also overwhelming for new or (speaking from recent personal experience) returning players. "You can dunk on it," Merrill said in reference to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> main menu as we compared and contrasted the two systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A perhaps unfair ribbing of the menu screen experienced by most of Riot Games' customers' aside (that is carefully maintained and updated by hardworking developers, the compare-and-contrast allowed us to discuss Riot's top-level strategy for the "lifespan" of its online games—and how taking a wide a view as possible of that lifespan is essential to its continued market position.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Avoiding conventional &quot;industry logic&quot; about online games">Avoiding conventional "industry logic" about online games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Merrill laid out two ideas about the future of online games that he fundamentally disagrees with. First, he said it's "absurd" to think that young </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players are forever bound to the block-based game's ecosystem, "A lot of times the social motivations and [desire] to play where your friends are playing—those things are incredibly powerful," he said. "But that doesn't mean if somebody grew up in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that all they're gonna do for their life is played like block games or a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox-like</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">." Those players—like any other player—are on the hunt for experiences that resonate with them, those experiences may just take different forms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second idea, was that the only way for a company to view an online game's lifespan was through the lens of growth, peak, and inevitable decline. If you followed that logic, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be considered a failure since its monthly average user count </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://prioridata.com/data/league-of-legends/">is estimated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to have peaked in 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One thing we try to fight a lot is the mindset that the product life cycle is one of growth, a spike, and then a slow decline. That's also silly," he said. "There is entropy, there's downward pressure, it's hard to keep people engaged over a long period of time and continue to make it fresh. But that doesn't mean there aren't incredible things to do to improve the experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those "things" might not just be updates to the content pipeline. Riot's triple-pronged strategy of esports, animated adaptations, and music productions are all part of the strategy to sustain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> even though it may not be as popular as it was in the 2010s. "That would never have happened if we were like 'well, you know, we start to see churn rates increasing, time to go move all resources to something else,'" said Merrill.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devs who want to follow this strategy but maybe don't have Riot's cash can still study its success.

Merrill repeated the company's talking point that in-game harassment is far less prevalent than it may seem from the outside (but the few bad eggs going above and beyond to hurt people have a big impact, he acknowledged), but there are fascinating new frontiers to explore. Of late, he said Riot is studying how the dynamics of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> matches drive toxicity, sometimes driven by a misalignment between what different teammates want out of a match.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some [toxic] players feel justified on what they're doing and why," he said, laying out a use case where a player in the "ADC" role (a damage-focused role in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) might feel frustrated by a "support" player not keeping up with them or being repeatedly taken out by the enemy team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or there's the inverse—where a support player is playing passively and has an ADC teammate they can't keep up with.

Times change, tastes change, and companies can risk falling behind the curve—but you don't have to look at tomorrow's players as an impossible enigma. Just like yesterday's, they're searching for great experiences, and there's good odds your game might just be what they're looking for.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

		<p>Frogwares has released the first proper gameplay for The Sinking City 2, alongside the launch of the game’s Kickstarter campaign. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/the-sinking-city-2-has-gone-full-on-horror-coming-out-in-2025/">The Sinking City 2 was announced</a> in March last year following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/the-sinking-city-publishing-rights-now-fully-controlled-by-frogwares/">Frogwares successful bid</a> at securing the publishing rights to The Sinking City. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">The Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> has a goal of $105,000, with the funds primarily being used as a safety net for the studio, as Frogwares is based in Ukraine.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sinking City 2 - Gameplay Reveal &amp; Kickstarter Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtyEOb2IBZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we’ve learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.”</em> , said Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares.</p>
<p>In addition to the teaser, there is also a five minute deep dive into the game and the new direction of putting horror first, though The Sinking City 2 will also retain some of the investigative style of the first game.</p>

<p>The story of The Sinking City 2 will see you in Arkham, a city that is falling under the waves that you can explore on foot and in a boat. There are mansions and abandoned hospitals that will hold all sorts of mysteries and dangers. There will be 1920s styled weapons available but resources will be scarce, and the inventory will be very limited so you will have to decide on what to keep hold of, and what to ditch. There will be plenty of mysteries to discover and solve, with many being morally grey so no choice will be too easy. The Sinking City 2 is due to release this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-brings-new-sub-biome-and-more-next-week.1126983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Bags and Blasts update, which will bring a new sub-biome, a new boss, and more next week.</p>

<p>Bags and Blasts will serve as&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s first major update since the sandbox survival game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">launched out of Early Access back in August</a>. Its first major addition is the Oasis, a new sub-biome that you'll find within the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-desert-of-beginnings-biome-guide" rel="nofollow">Desert of Beginnings area</a>.</p>

<p>In the Oasis, you'll find the adorable camel-like Drohmble, which you can ranch to "uncover a valuable (but stinky) resource useful for crafting new mid-late game weaponry". That one's only for those with strong stomachs, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=m_xQ3L4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=5wj3e42f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll find&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s new Oasis area in the Desert of Beginnings.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just the Drohmble you'll have to look out for. Bags and Blasts will also introduce Nimruza, a giant "super cicada" boss who serves as one of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s "biggest fights yet", according to Pugstorm.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of using explosives in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, you'll likely also appreciate the new Explosives skill tree, which comes complete with eight new skills for you to try out. New bomb types will also be added, as well as a new grenade weapon type.</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update also introduces Pouches, a "highly-requested" community feature that allows you to carry various resources in dedicated spaces, making inventory management easier.</p>

<p>You can also take advantage of a new hotbar swapping feature that lets you decide which inventory row you see in your hotbar. All in all, it sounds like Bags and Blasts will be perfect for you if you like to tinker with your items for hours on end.</p>




<p><em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update launches on March 10th. You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/core-keeper/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/core-keeper/9pkw4gmx4j8k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/core-keeper-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can read our Ashley's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/core-keeper-review" rel="nofollow">review of its 1.0 release here</a>.</p>

<p>Trying to run <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> is a futile endeavour, as is trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">run it on any other PC hardware</a> that might variously be called cheap, old, or otherwise low-end. However, today’s arrival of the beast-stabbin’, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/being-authorised-to-hunt-in-monster-hunter-wilds-is-a-kink">consent-grantin’</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> on Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">GeForce Now streaming platform</a> does enable a sort of bodged alternative: a way to play Wilds on this most modest of handhelds, potentially at a sturdy 60fps.</p>
<p>GeForce Now extracts a not-insubstantial fee to enable streaming from its best rigs: the Performance (formerly Priority) subscription is £10 / $10 per month for RTX 3060- or RTX 2080-level performance, while the £20 / $20 Ultimate tier provides access to an RTX 4080 system. But it also syncs with your existing Steam library, so if you already own Wilds, you can stream it via GFN at no additional cost. I tried it on the Steam Deck using my Ultimate subscription, and was almost always bumping up against the 60fps cap, even after enabling ray tracing.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Steam-Deck.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>For comparison, running under the Steam Deck’s own... well, steam, you’d be lucky to average out a coughing 25fps at potato settings. There is a tiny dash of input lag when steaming, but I found it generally smooth and responsive enough to control as well.</p>
<p>As with any kind of cloud gaming setup, there are other caveats besides the sub costs. That responsivity is reliant on a fast and stable Wi-Fi connection – if you have patchy spots in your house, or sluggish Internet in general, you run the danger of higher latency and/or impaired visuals from the slowed-down video feed. It also means that taking your Steam Deck out and about, as it was designed for in the first place, will oblige your monsters to remain unhunted unless you can find (and trust) some decent Wi-Fi in the wilds.</p>
<p>As such, I wouldn’t call streaming a fix for Wilds’ dodgy Deck performance, though for sofa/toilet-based playing at home, it does make for a happier marriage of game and hardware than installing and running it locally. And the possibility at least exists – unlike with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-use-steam-remote-play-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Remote Play</a> – to keep going round a friends’ house or in a hotel room. Small victories, ‘suppose.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in October 2023, former Bullfrog chappie and Fable developer Dene Carter sidled up out of nowhere and released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonring">Moonring</a>, a terrific open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultima">Ultima</a> tradition of top-down, tile-based bump-attacking. It had crisp neon sprites floating on seas of arcade cabinet black, an enticing mythology, elusive magic systems, procedural dungeons and dialogue based on remembering or deducing keywords. All this for free - statistically my second favourite price tag after the developer actually paying me to play the game. Which does not happen as often as you might think, you tinfoil hat-wearing scalliwags.
</p>
<p>
Now, Moonring <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2373630/view/508447709615623279?l=english">has some DLC</a>. It's called Moonring DLX and consists of the Egg, a 100 floor megadungeon "with the vague promise of a silly boss and a prize". Yes, the dungeon looks like an egg. Unlike Moonring and like most eggs encountered in daily life, the Egg costs money - $4.99, €4.99 or £4.29.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you have that amount of change to hand, and you've sunk tens of hours into Moonring, you might consider buying the DLX edition just to say thank you. I can't think of a way to make that not sound like guilt-tripping, so here's a video of the game instead.

<p>
I myself am still scratching at the upper levels and opening sanctums of Moonring's eerie universe. I still haven't worked out how to cast magic, a carrot dangled early on that seemingly requires a fair amount of investigation and questing. The highlights, for me, are those procgen dungeons, which string together traps, spawns, chests, locks and hazards in mildly broken ways. I wouldn't say no to another 100 floors of such shenanigans.
</p>
<p>Even if you don't plump for the DLC, you might want to revisit Moonring. It's been updated a fair bit since October 2023. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373630/Moonring/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fully completing the game and snagging every trophy or achievement will take some dedication, as you’ll need to be on the same page about finishing every side story and finding a variety of optional one-off moments throughout the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em> has a very generous chapter select that allows you to revisit past segments of the game and wrap up any side content you may have missed on your first pass through a level. This makes full completion much less stressful, leaving you to enjoy your initial play at a pace that feels right for you and your gaming partner.</p><p>If you’re a completionist looking to get the absolute most out of <em>Split Fiction</em>, you can expect to spend around <strong>15 hours</strong> experiencing its sci-fi and fantasy worlds. This includes stopping to check out all of the side stories and fun little interactions, or using the aforementioned chapter select to catch up on any of these you missed your first time through the game.</p><hr><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC. And remember: Only one person has to buy the game, as it features a Friend’s Pass that allows a second person to play for free. So you only have half the excuses for not jumping into this thrilling co-op adventure right away!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While plans can always change, what that means right now is that the meeting place for 200 million monthly users, over 90 percent of whom use it for gaming, is exploring going from a private company to a public one ruled by the founding principle of the stock market: number must go up. </p><p>“We understand there is a lot of interest around Discord’s future plans, but we do not comment on rumors or speculation,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>The New York Times</em>. “Our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience for our users and building a strong, sustainable business.” </p><p>Discord was released in 2015 by founders Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy. After shipping a MOBA royale on iPad called <em>Fates Forever</em> in 2014 that never took off, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/hammer-chisel-pivots-to-voice-comm-app-for-multiplayer-mobile-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/hammer-chisel-pivots-to-voice-comm-app-for-multiplayer-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they pivoted to making communications platform for online gamers</a></span>. Online games were exploding at the time and the tools for communicating in them were pretty bad. Discord filled the void when it came to coordinating raids in  <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>or ganks in <em>Dota 2</em>. </p><p>It eventually became a one-stop shop for gaming conversations online, offering an alternative to boring, stilted workplace productivity tools like Skype and Slack, as well as archaic gaming forums, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitter-discord-elon-musk-buys-social-media-online-comm-1848853337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitter-discord-elon-musk-buys-social-media-online-comm-1848853337">fire-hose social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter</a></span>. Discord is now fully-integrated on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, and serves as a better solution to Nintendo Switch’s terrible voice chat app, and the frustrating hiccups of cross-platform party chat. Powering this takeover has been the fact 1) Discord works and 2) the majority of its features are entirely free. </p><p>Going public could change all of that. We’ve seen the playbook before. Tech company woos hundreds of millions of users with a great product that’s practically free, and then once they’re locked into the platform through history, network effects, or just old habit, squeezes as much financial value out of the thing by making it worse in almost every way possible. If this were A Christmas Carol and Discord was Ebenezer Scrooge then Facebook would be the Jacob Marley shaking its chains in the chat app’s face. <br></p><p>This is what the author Cory Doctorow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has dubbed enshittification</a></span>. Online products and services get worse over time as the companies behind them are forced to extract more and more value no matter the long-terms costs. Being private doesn’t make a company immune from this, but going public certainly has the potential to be like throwing TNT into a dumpster fire. This shift was already evident in Discord—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see its embrace of online advertising just last year</a></span>—but seems only likely to worsen with a potential IPO payout looming overhead. Look no farther then Reddit’s road to going public, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24097069/reddit-ipo-public-investment-ai-training-data-google&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24097069/reddit-ipo-public-investment-ai-training-data-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paved with generative-AI deals and API price hikes</a></span>. </p><p>The increasing enshittification of Discord is even more worrying. It’s now the defacto town square for many of the biggest games around, from <em>Marvel Rivals</em> to <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Rockstar Games just launched its own Discord channel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536">in preparation for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a></span>, likely to be the biggest game launch ever when it arrives later this year. The price of exiting the platform if features get worse or locked behind a paywall is only going up. And any communities that do leave will have to leave their pasts behind, sealed off like The Cask of Amontillado from the rest of the internet. Discord’s separation from that crumbling infrastructure has long been one of its greatest virtues, making it feel like a relative safe heaven from SEO spam and algorithmic churn. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695">It could one day make it feel more like a tomb</a></span>.<br></p><p>High on a pandemic-fueled influx of new users, Discord once flirted with growing beyond its gaming roots. There was talk of it supplanting Slack and of Microsoft buying it for a potential $6.5 billion. Then last year it promised it was getting back to basics and doubling down on its original core mission. “We believe Discord can play a uniquely important role in the future of gaming,” Citron <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote at the time</a></span>. “We’re going to focus on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing—and we’ll help developers of those games bring their creativity to life.”<br></p><p>We’ll see if that remains the case. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-collection-release-latest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A purported Gears of War Collection has been a frequent topic of conversation in recent times. It’s a rumored remake or remastering of many legendary Gears titles, and if you’re eager to learn more, we’ve gathered the latest details on a possible collection of classics.</p>



<p>Gears of War was once one of Microsoft’s most powerful franchises. From day one, its first few sequels sold like hot cakes as fans lapped up the lopping off of Locust heads. Fatigue eventually kicked in, and the famous franchise has stagnated in recent years due to the dwindling popularity of Xbox.</p>



<p>We could be set for a Gears resurgence thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War E-Day</a> and a potential Gears of War Collection. Let’s dispense with the dialogue and do some digging.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-gears-of-war-collection-release-details">Do we Know Gears of War Collection Release Details?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eye see you there. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The latest reports indicate a Gears of War Collection could release in mid-2025—possibly August 2025.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is all speculation, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. But leaker <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Detective Seeds</a> claims the <strong>Gears of War Collection is already on storefronts</strong>. They also claim the release period is likely to be <strong>mid-August</strong>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Gears of War collection should be releasing early to mid August.  It is PS5 pro enhanced, but I have been told NO Multiplayer PVP, campaign focus only.</span></p></article></div>



<p>This would back up industry insider <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden</a>‘s previous report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War is coming later in 2025</a>. Leakers and insiders tend to have exclusive information (as we know ourselves) that is usually correct. All signs point toward a Gears of War Collection and an assortment of remade or reimagined Gears titles in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-games-could-be-in-gears-of-war-collection">Which Games Could be in Gears of War Collection?</h2>



<p><strong>Currently, rumors and leaks can’t identify which Gears of War games will be added to the Collection—it could be any number of games from Gears of War 1 to Gears 5.</strong></p>



<p>The only report so far—also from Jez Corden—indicates <strong>Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition</strong> could be one of the games. One crucial aspect seemingly known about the collection is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-collection-will-feature-co-op-but-no-pvp-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op is present, but there’s no multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this if concrete details are revealed or rumors intensify.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-collection-platforms-rumors">Gears of War Collection Platforms Rumors</h2>



<p><strong>The possible Gears of War Collection could release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>The headline here is <strong>Gears of War arriving on PlayStation hardware for the first time</strong>. Gears has long been a treasured Xbox exclusive. However, we already know several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games are coming to PlayStation</a>, making this expected and no longer a shock.</p>



<p>YouTube leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a> claims the collection “Will be revealed during the Xbox Showcase later this year.” It’s all a lot to take in, but it’s an interesting and exciting time for the games industry. Check back as we try to find out more about the rumored Gears of War Collection.</p>

<p>Is a reimagined Gears of War Collection exactly what the legendary franchise needs right now? Would it be the perfect tune-up for the upcoming Gears of War E-Day prequel? Share your best Gears memories here, or head to our Insider Gaming forum.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is still in a state of war that impacts the lives of everyone in the country. Frogwares has therefore opted to use Kickstarter once again to create a safety net for the studio, to help secure some additional features for the game, and to get more direct access to its most diehard fans.</p><p>“After three years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we’ve learned to adapt, though it has never been easy,” said Frogwares CEO Wael Amr. “In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.”</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign has a target of €100,000 / $105,000 and offers a selection of rewards to fans, with the focal point being two physical Collector’s Editions that will be made available only to Kickstarter backers.</p><p>Alongside the campaign, the team has also released a five minutes deep dive developer diary showcasing the current state of development, additional in-game footage and more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_948258"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight to Survive</strong> – Use an arsenal of 1920s-inspired firearms and melee weapons to fight against Eldritch-inspired admonitions.</li><li><strong>Explore the Decaying City of Arkham</strong> – A world of decaying mansions, flooded markets and abandoned hospitals that you’ll explore by foot and by boat.</li><li><strong>Find and Use What You Can</strong> – Scrounge for limited resources and balance a finite inventory as you decide what to bring and what to leave behind.</li><li><strong>Choose to Investigate Further</strong> – Solve optional cases and puzzles that let you investigate your surroundings deeper to uncover secrets, alternate options, and more lore.</li><li><strong>A Twisted Lovecraftian Tale</strong> – <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a morally grey and captivating story focused on personal loss and woven around the Lovecraftian mythos of cults, rituals, and incomprehensible creatures.</li></ul><p><strong>Still Pushing The Studio in a New Direction</strong></p><p>With <em>The Sinking City 2</em>, Frogwares is going full steam ahead with its original pledge to pivot the studio to a “horror-first” focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration, and its Lovecraftian setting.</p><p>“When we announced <em>The Sinking City 2</em> back in 2024, we stated this is going to be our chance to shift our studio into creating games that are more ‘horror first’-focused and the results we’re all seeing internally are extremely promising,” said Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Ohanesyan. “We’re not ditching our investigation roots entirely but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow.

Leasing a PS5 Pro, meanwhile, starts at £19/month for 36 months, scaling up to £27/month for a 12-month lease. Sony also offers monthly rolling leases that allow players to cancel any time, but these are considerably more expensive (£36/month for the PS5 Pro).</p><p>This doesn't appear to be a rent-to-own program.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has had the biggest physical launch of any PS5 game released in Japan so far.</p>
<p>According to the latest sales figures from Japanese magazine <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/35700">Famitsu</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 601,179 physical copies in its first week - so not including digital and PC sales.</p>
<p>While this is higher than other physical sales of PS5 games in Japan, it's lower than previous Monster Hunter games. However, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds sold 8m copies in its first three days</a> to become Capcom's fastest-selling game ever, these sales numbers suggest a big shift towards digital sales.</p>

<p>What's more, the PS5 hardware itself sold 108,978 units across the base console, digital-only console, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> causing a significant boost in sales.</p>
<p>For comparison, on its Switch release in Japan Monster Hunter Rise sold over 1.30m physical units at launch, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> sold over 1.35m physical units on PS4 in its first three days of release in Japan (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/04/famitsu-sales-3-22-21-3-28-21">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2025/01/30/the-top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2024/">last year's best-selling PS5 game</a> was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> with 358,353 lifetime sales, while <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2024/02/01/the-top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2023/">in 2023</a> it was Final Fantasy 16 with 429,330 and <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2023/02/02/top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2022/">in 2022</a> it was Gran Turismo 7 with 218,013.</p>
<p>As such, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold considerably more in just its first week, with these numbers once again proving the game's rapid success.</p>
<p>At 8m copies sold worldwide, Monster Hunter Wilds has already bested the lifetime sales of Street Fighter 5, Street Fighter 2, and the original Resident Evil 2, as per <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab1">Capcom's Platinum Titles list</a>. In fact it's not far behind lifetime sales of Monster Hunter Rise DLC Sunbreak, which had sold 9.4m units by December last year.</p>
<p>What's more, the game's release in Japan has caused a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">surge in both PS5 rentals</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">sales of cheese naans</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Marvel's Spider-Man 2 patch is now live on PC, introducing CPU and GPU performance improvements, ray tracing fixes and more.</p>
<p>The game's Patch 4 focuses on performance improvements, introducing CPU and GPU performance optimizations related to ray tracing and performance improvements in areas with sand. The new patch also addresses issues related to ray tracing, such as an issue that caused characters to appear darker than they should have when Ambient Occlusion was set to XSeGTAO, ray-traced reflections issues, ambient occlusion and ray-traced shadows, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also introduces fixes for other issues, such as certain settings getting reset when the game is restarted, crashing issues on quad-core processors, and more. Full patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/497189343402656156?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launched in a rather poor state back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">January</a>, but PC port developer Nixxes released multiple patches that addressed some of the most common launch complaints, including crashing issues. The previous patch, which went live<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-patch-1-212-1-0-screen-space-reflections-dlss-ray-reconstruction/"> last month</a>, introduced a few more fixes, including one that finally allowed users to enable DLSS Ray Reconstruction when running the game at native resolution.</p>
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the series developed by Insomniac by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-xbox-insider-update-factory-resetting-xbox-consoles.1126932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-xbox-insider-update-factory-reset<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Xbox Insider update is apparently causing users' consoles to revert to factory settings, removing profiles and settings in the process.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-latest-system-update-for-xbox-insiders-is-removing-their-user-profiles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, the problem is happening to those who are signed up to the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers of the Insider program, which allow users to download updates that will probably contain some pretty serious bugs given how early in the testing process they are.</p>

<p>That certainly seems to be the case with the latest update, which is apparently causing users' Xbox profiles, system setting preferences, and Quick Resume gameplay data to be deleted, essentially reverting the console to factory settings.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-ui.jpg?itok=Hao4NWu2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-ui.jpg?itok=oa9t8KVo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The latest Xbox Insider update comes with a pretty serious bug, by the sounds of things.</figcaption></figure><p>As VGC tells it, once the update is installed (which it will be if you're signed up to the aforementioned tiers, since it's now mandatory), the Xbox runs through its initial setup procedure rather than loading the Xbox dashboard as it normally would.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like the console isn't deleting users' installed games, which means it probably also isn't deleting save data stored locally. This does, however, mean that if this has happened to you, you'll probably need to re-add any profiles that were previously on your console.</p>

<p>If you're not signed up to the Xbox Insider program, then it sounds like you don't need to worry about this problem; it's just for those who are part of the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by the time the latest system software update makes its way to the general populace, this problem will have been fixed; these tiers are for those who don't mind a few extra bugs with their updates, after all, although I don't think most Insider users bargained for this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-astronaut.jpg?itok=dCwMY8iJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-astronaut.jpg?itok=hffZpYqJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Be careful if you're one of the Xbox Insider astronauts who likes to test new updates.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather amusingly, the update itself was only intended to fix a couple of bugs related to profile viewing and Dolby Vision, but it appears to have caused a much worse problem in the process.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, the company recently revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>reboot has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2026</a>, but that work on the game is progressing apace. Stay tuned for more.</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a game that both revived and redefined a genre to the extent that <em>XCOM </em>did? Prior to Firaxis’ 2012 reboot, the genre could be described without embellishment as an abandoned wasteland. In its wake, the revitalized genre seemed poised to thrive. Ubisoft and Nintendo even got in on the action with their own take, sending Mario and Peach into battle alongside the Rabbids. And every new game, or turn-based RPG that took some inspiration from <em>XCOM’s </em>design, was quickly described by its own creators and games media as “like <em>XCOM</em>.”</p><p>Which is embarrassing. Too rarely, it’s embarrassing because the game in question isn’t actually like <em>XCOM </em>at all. Far more often, it’s embarrassing because that description fits its subject perfectly. Here’s a Cold War espionage game. Here’s a 1930s adventurer archaeologist game. Here’s a post-apocalypse furry game. Here’s a cowboy game. They are all XCOM. With some twists and spins, sure. But they all start there.</p><p><em>XCOM’s </em>influence is too great, its shadow too long. Instead of a thriving genre we have a thin slice of it crammed with variations on the same, limited model that XCOM itself already stretched. Tactics games should be more than this. They <em>were </em>more than this. And I think the proof lies in another game: X-COM.</p><p>Let's contextualise that.</p><p>From rise to fall, exile to return, the status of the X-COM series throughout its history makes it a strangely reliable barometer for the overall health of turn-based tactics.</p><p>The first entry, 1994's UFO: Enemy Unknown (aka X-COM: UFO Defense), was originally a sequel to Laser Squad, itself a descendent of the Rebelstar series stretching back to 1984. Like its remake, UFO was famously punishing, and built on a detailed strategy/management layer, and a premise inspired by a sometimes prescient, kinda dull <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_(British_TV_series)?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">TV series</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But it wasn't about elite badasses posing in chunky combat armour, reliably unlocking the optimal perks. Its soldiers were very much just guys. Twitchy, jumpsuited grunts whose only hope was whatever you put in their hands, counting on superior numbers of semi-disposable bodies in the early days. They crept fearfully about, square by square, spending four of their 40-70 Action Points each time, hoping they weren't being watched by an alien who only needed them to spend three more AP to turn them into a soup-like homogenate.</p><p>The Action Point and the granularity it represented ruled the genre in the 90s, and brought<em> UFO</em> huge success even in North America, where fiddly, slower-paced strategy games sometimes struggled with pre-internet distribution. Its strategic side was comparably granular, requiring management down to every magazine, while the aliens actively operated in the world, unseen until your carefully-placed radar caught them out.</p><p>Its inevitable sequel was less interesting than the start of a similar series: 1995's <em>Jagged Alliance</em>. A mercenary management game that replaced the plasma fodder with unique premade characters with voices, personalities, and opinions. It was made redundant by a 1999 sequel, coincidentally named <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em>.</p><p>Both amped up the details. Mercs could sneak and crawl, the wounded bled at different rates, bandaged over multiple turns, and required a merc with medical skills and supplies to recover. Poorly maintained guns could jam. Stamina went from seldom relevant to crucial, as even non-penetrating shots drained it, and puffed out mercs did everything worse except complaining and collapsing (same). A high marksmanship or medical stat helped less if that merc's hands were shaky or aged. Their "interrupt" system is flat out better than UFO's "opportunity fire" (soldiers automatically use leftover AP to repeatedly shoot during the aliens’ turn) and <em>XCOM's</em> similar, worse overwatch. Interrupts grant full control of characters who catch the enemy out, letting <em>you </em>use their remaining AP however you want, not mindlessly blast the first thing that moves. It even took action points to raise a gun before firing (a varying number per weapon), which you could do in advance to gain that split second edge over an enemy.</p><p>This model showcases a different fundamental principle of design: characters aren’t able to do more because you gave them a perk, a special move they can fire off like magic. Anyone can attempt anything. Ability is a gradient, not an absolute, and possibilities derive primarily from systems interacting rather than unlocks and puzzling out the unstoppable combos.</p><p><em>JA2's</em> complex simulation, colourful personality, and highly non-linear campaign map make it a peak of the genre even today. But with only 90s game distribution and publishing attitudes to rely on, its future was bleak.</p><p>By 1999, <em>X-COM</em> was also headed for trouble. The third game, <em>X-COM: Apocalypse</em>, escalated the series' destructible environments to exploit all its futuristic weapons. Missed shots in <em>UFO</em> might put a gap in a wall, but leave hovering rooftops. <em>Apocalypse</em> drained a building's owner cash for every wall you damaged, every incendiary round that burned away the stairs and brought the catwalk crashing down. Dropped munitions might ignite, and some aliens exploded on purpose, just to be like that. The strategy map became a simulated city, with dozens of organisations deploying vehicles, and potentially supporting or targeting the player. New recruits visibly travelled from slums (never antagonise the taxi firm), deliveries could be shot down, a stray missile bring down a bridge that prevented your APC from reaching a mission.</p><figure><figcaption><span>X-COM Apocalypse embraced chaos in combat</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love it for throwing in portable teleporters with building-sized terror beasts, evil bacteria, and what looked like killer baked beans. But <em>Apocalypse</em> was clearly rushed out, and most ideas like the city politics had few, dull consequences. An ambitious decision to include real-time <em>and</em> turned-based modes compromised both, and its easy detection and battle AI beelining for the player undermined much sense of lurking alien menace. Where <em>JA2</em> jettisoned some of <em>JA’s </em>details (you no longer had to bury dead mercs, for example) to focus on others, <em>Apoc</em> was all new ideas, and had too little time and focus (same).</p><p>Rather than refine those ideas, the series began to tailspin with spin-offs like <em>Interceptor </em>("What if <em>X-COM</em> had space dogfights?"),<em> First Alien Invasion</em> ("What if <em>X-COM</em> was a surprisingly good email game that nobody played?"), and <em>Enforcer </em>("What if we just didn't give a shit?").</p><p><em>Interceptor </em>was a fun idea, and porting the core design to other genres still has potential. But its middling action didn't inspire an innately niche audience. "Underdog space pilot" and "all-powerful administrator" are very different fantasies (and if you've ever been an underdog administrator, congrats on the burnout), and space combat games were about to vanish anyway. None of these experiments got a second chance.</p><p>The structure of the games industry at that time deserves an invective-laden article of its own. Between the rise of actually good 3D, the idiotic hardware dickwaving wars, shifts in the console market, and the doubling down on nurturing toxic gamer culture by the handful of corporate publishing behemoths who stood over all distribution like inbred colossi, suffice to say that once third-person shooter <em>Enforcer </em>was sharted out by Hasbro Interactive in 2001, <em>X-COM</em> was as good as dead. Turn-based tactics practically died with it. As the sectoid-bashing star waned, the whole genre collapsed into a malnourished ghetto considered radioactive by most publishers.</p><p>In 2003 the exceptional <em>Silent Storm</em> demonstrated how 3D physics could be more than just shiny. A shot fired in Jagged Alliance might hit the guy next to your target. A shot fired in Silent Storm might go <em>through </em>your target, ricochet off a cobblestone and blind his nearby friend, or go through a thin wall and hit an ammo crate that brings half the building down. And on the next turn, an enemy in the attic shoots down through the hole. This wasn't an arbitrary ultra-failed attack; it was possible because of the properties of every element involved. That's the key: these were simulationist games. Firing a gun creates a bullet that goes <em>somewhere</em>, where in XCOM you either succeed or nothing happens. A spray of bullets is multiple independent shots, not one agglutinated attack action.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Silent Storm's ballistics and physics remain singular in the genre</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Silent Storm</em> got a decent expansion, but largely disappeared instead of inspiring the decade of successors it deserved. Even today, its robust engine, destruction of almost everything, and room to tactically exploit them remain impressive, but apart from a very obscure sequel in <em>Hammer &amp; Sickle</em>, the ground it broke has been pretty much untouched since.</p>

<p>The latest Xbox update for members of the Xbox Insider program is resetting consoles to their factory default settings. This, according to many who’ve gone through with the update.</p>



<p>The problem arises for those who have installed the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead updates. When installed, Xbox profiles, Quick Resume information, and console settings are wiped. To make matters worse, the update is mandatory for insiders.</p>



<p>A quick visit to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Insider subreddit</a> sees a number of posts complaining about the issue. Many are requesting the update be pulled offline, but it doesn’t appear anyone has heard from the company.</p>



<p>“I totally understand that programs like this are here to find problems like this but it’s the complete lack of action on the development team when a bad update goes live on a test branch and it stays live for 18+ hours,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/comment/mgbh7r1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user</a>.</p>



<p>One thing the update doesn’t appear to do, at least, is deleted any local game save data on the Xbox consoles. As of publishing, Microsoft has yet to comment on the issues. Insider Gaming has reached out for an official response.</p>

                <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra doesn't have an official release date or even window yet beyond "2025," but according to one of the game's voice actors, we could be playing it by the end of the year. </p><p>The game's Black Panther voice actor, Khary Payton, told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, "We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025. We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." While the game seemingly already had a 2025 release window, Payton's comment at least narrows down a potential launch month.</p>
