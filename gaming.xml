            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Starbreeze Entertainment is passing the torch of maintaining Payday 2 onto Sidetrack Games, so that Starbreeze can focus more on Payday 3. Sidetrack Games will take over future updates for Payday 2, including fixing any bugs that may come along, adding quality-of-life updates, and just overall keeping the game running and live for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>"<em>Sidetrack (formerly known as the M.U.G. Team) is a talented team with deep roots in the Payday modding community</em>," Starbreeze writes in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/553504715299620867">announcement on the Payday 2 Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Their work on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414740/RAID_World_War_II/">RAID: World War II</a> showed that they have the skill and perseverance to deliver quality updates over a long time. They know the Payday 2 engine inside and out, and they've already gotten started</em>. <em>The first update goes live this Thursday, October 23, and is focused on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Collaborating with Sidetrack Games allows Starbreeze to maintain full focus on Payday 3, while Payday 2 continues to deliver value for all players with the dedicated, expert support they deserve</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We've partnered with Sidetrack Games to support PD 2 on PC! They have roots in the modding community, and we have trust they'll bring the game back to life!</p><p>Starting Oct. 23 the first update will come out, and they'll be focusing on QoL updates to start: <a href="https://t.co/JjEpneo71b">https://t.co/JjEpneo71b</a> <a href="https://t.co/USU6I0lU2H">pic.twitter.com/USU6I0lU2H</a></p></div>— PAYDAY 3 (@PAYDAYGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1980620480500383832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Starbreeze also states that it'll host a live stream on Thursday, where it will delve further into the details around its collaboration with Sidetrack Games.</p>



<p>This is the latest update for Payday 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/">since the DLC subscription service</a> that Starbreeze introduced, and later had to apologize for due to Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/">also decreasing the discount on the Infamous Collection</a> for Payday 2. Basically, it made the previous avenue for acquiring all of Payday 2's DLC more expensive, to make the subscription service more appealing. Starbreeze restored the Infamous Collection discount to where it was before the subscription service was released.</p>



<p>As for where Payday 3 fits into this, it's clear that Starbreeze wants to focus its efforts on making Payday 3 more appealing for Payday fans, since many of them still haven't moved off of Payday 2. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/">cancelled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based co-op game</a> in order to focus more on Payday 3, and now it has passed off maintaining Payday 2 to put more time into Payday 3.</p>



<p>However, even with the extra space to work on Payday 3, it'll still take years for it to be anything close to what Payday 2 is. The sheer quantity of DLCs available to Payday 2 players will take years to match, never mind just hitting the same quality bar as the ones players love in Payday 2. Payday 3 also, as far as we know, still won't include everything that players want from it, now that Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-no-longer-developing-payday-3-offline-mode-not-feasible-for-studio/">has confirmed it won't be working on an offline mode for the game</a>.</p>



<p>In any case, Starbreeze seems committed to making up for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">the abysmal launch that Payday 3 had</a>, which was plagued by scores of technical and server connection issues, and a gross lack of content. We'll see where Payday 3 stands a year from now, and if Starbreeze has begun to make inroads in their journey to make Payday fans play Payday 3, which, two years after release, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/#1y">struggles to get more than 3K concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p>If you’re rushing to grab the latest round of free-ish games included in October’s PS Plus Extra or Premium bundle, you might want to slow your horses slightly and double-check that you aren’t about to accidentally lose your ownership of one of the games forever. Due to an ongoing bug with the PlayStation’s current subscription service, if you previously picked up PS Plus Essential’s giveaway of <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> in 2022, downloading it again today will erase your license to own it completely!</p> <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This issue is pointed out by <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/10/21/ps-plus-extra-essential-yakuza-like-a-dragon-game-license/"><em>PlayStation Lifestyle</em>‘s Zarmena Khan</a>, who has been trying to raise awareness of this hefty problem ever since Sony relaunched its PS Plus service three years ago. It boils down like this: Back in the day, when you downloaded the monthly freebies from PS Plus Essential, they were yours to keep for so long as you maintained your subscription. It was a great deal, and made logging in at the start of a month—well—essential. However, in 2022 this changed, with PS Plus shifting to be more like Microsoft’s Game Pass, such that the games are only accessible to play so long as they remain a part of the PS Plus catalog. Once they’re gone from there, you can no longer play them without paying for the full version. The problem is, if you picked up a game via the Essential service and then re-download it via the modern PS Plus, your original license is permanently overwritten and you’ll lose access to a game you previously owned once its time on the sub comes to an end. And that’s pretty bad!</p>

 <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This month makes this issue particularly relevant, with <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which was originally given away as part of PS Plus Essential in August 2022, now available in the catalog. Reddit user kabirsingh84 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1obn64b/reminder_if_you_claimed_the_ps_plus_essential/">first raised the concern yesterday</a>, reminding people that the PS Plus Extra version that arrives today will delete your license.</p>

   <p>So before you grab it—and indeed any other game added to the PS Plus subscription—make sure to check your library to see if you picked it up any time before 2022. It’s so easy to have grabbed all three games in any given month, forgot you ever did, and then too easily lose your ongoing right to play it.</p> <p>Of course, this all shines a bright light on the degree to which <a href="https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641">we increasingly don’t own the majority of the games we play, or even buy</a>, as consumer rights are eroded by deeply dubious digital licenses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-out-galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-before-the-black-friday-rush-while-apple-sticks-to-full-price.1330426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the name implies, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is slim. It measures in at under a quarter inch thick. Beyond that, you’re getting the quintessential Samsung Galaxy experience with this phone.&nbsp;The Samsung Galaxy S25 family of phones come in a few different storage capacity options plus a whole slew of colors, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/">but right now the Edge model with 512GB is deeply on sale. You’ll save 40% on the specifically the titanium silver and titanium jet black options</a>. They normally go for $1,220, but the discount brings them down by $490. That makes it so you only have to pay $730 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Just because this model phone is extra thin, doesn’t mean it’s sacrificing any toughness. Each is made with a durable titanium build along with a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 face.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Photography</h2>
<p>Despite how thin the phone is, the S25 Edge is still able to pack in Samsung’s powerful 200MP camera. You can capture every stunning detail with the highest resolution camera on any Galaxy phone. It also includes and ultra wide auto-focus 12MP camera plus the 12MP selfie camera on the front.</p>
<p>One of the more practical uses of Galaxy AI integration in the S25 Edge is when it comes to the camera. The Samsung smartphone employs a feature called Best Face. You ever set up to take a group photo, snap a bunch in a row, then look back through them only to see there’s something wrong with each of them? Maybe Jolie blinked in the first, then Daniel got distracted and turned his head in the next. None of them are post-worthy. Well, Best Face can intelligently take everyone’s best look across all the photos and stitch them together into one perfect shot. It only takes a few seconds and can provide results for group photos of up to five people.</p>



<p>Selfies are also elevated when taken on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Galaxy AI can recognize your environment’s lighting and capture accurate skin tone, balancing the levels on the fly without any extra editing.</p>
<p>Finding photos through your camera roll has also been made easier. If you’re trying to find a specific pic you took, you can just describe it in your search to have Galaxy AI dig through your photos to bring you to it. Like maybe you dress your dog up as a Dracula for Halloween but you don’t remember what year that was. Just type in “vampire dog” and it should come up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise</span></a><span> is an excellent propaganda machine. Thanks to the anime focusing so heavily on the powerful bond between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash and his starter Pokémon, Pikachu</span></a><span>, everyone feels like they </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to love their first partner in each game. These cute little guys are typically given to you by a professor, and they serve as an early foundation for the rest of the team you’ll build out over the course of the game. But sometimes, you’ll boot one of these games up and realize you don’t like any of your options. Then you’re stuck with this hangnail of a Pokémon you don’t really care about. Friends, what if I told you that there’s another option? One that most trainers, chained down by sentimentality, never even consider? Put that little shit in the box and catch your actual fave.</span></p> <p><span>Every time a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game comes out, fans decide which of the three starter monsters they’ll be taking out on their adventure. These fire, water, and grass-type Pokémon are meant to give new players a sense of the series’ rock-paper-scissors-style types and weaknesses, and usually end up being faces of the franchise for a few years until the next game comes out. The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>games, however, have handled this a bit differently. Instead of three new critters to start your journey with, these experimental spin-off RPGs bring back old starters from previous games, but with a new twist. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>gives Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt’s final stages regional variants, and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>gives Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile Mega Evolutions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>, however, has gotten a bit of flak for its starter choice which includes Chikorita and Tepig, arguably two of the least popular starters in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>history even though they are both my special babies who have never done anything wrong. So if you fire up a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game only to find yourself greeted with three Pokémon you’re not particularly thrilled about, are you just forced to use them for several dozen hours? No, my friend. That’s just what Big Pokémon Company wants you to think.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005417"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005417">The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While I’ve never boxed a starter during my initial playthrough, I’m no stranger to treating my game-sanctioned first partner like any other Pokémon on my team. That’s because the second I boot up one of these games, I’m looking for my real starter: a Pichu or PIkachu. My favorite Pokémon is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, and because it’s the evolved form of the series’ mascot, my basic ass has the wonderful privilege of knowing my favorite boy is going to be in most games (we don’t talk about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i></a><span>). So every time I pick a starter in these games, I know they’re going to end up playing second fiddle to my electric rat. I learned at an early age that I don’t have to believe the lie that my starter has to be my best friend, because they’re often just a placeholder for the little yellow guy in my mind. That was true in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. I picked Chikorita, and when he evolved into Meganium, he was a surprise MVP of my playthrough thanks to the new grass/fairy-type Mega Evolution. But even though my time in Lumiose City began with this Pokémon, he didn’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to be in my party any longer than it took me to catch another critter. In fact, most games barely acknowledge the starter after you initially get one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, we have one of the more underwhelming starter line-ups ever, at least for people who hate good and cute babies like Chikorita and Tepig, with Totodile being far and away </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/over-half-of-you-are-picking-totodile-as-your-pokemon-legends-z-a-starter"><span>the most popular of the trio</span></a><span>. What if you don’t need a water-type Pokémon in your party because your favorite is Gyarados? Did Totodile’s ugly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution after it becomes Feraligatr</span></a><span> put you off the blue dude altogether? The secret no one at Game Freak wants you to know is that you can put that little guy in a box and make a party that has no starters in it at all. Hell, take it a step further and release that red-headed stepchild back into the wild. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-crossdress-clothing-options-gender-2000637336"><span>Taunie and Urbain</span></a><span> don’t have to know you sent their Pokémon down the street with a bindle. Break free of the chains of decades of Ash and Pikachu brainwashing and write your own story.</span></p>

              <p>Dating isn’t easy. Especially if you happen to be a poor female soul cursed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/magazine/men-heterofatalism-dating-relationships.html?utm_source=newsshowcase&amp;utm_medium=gnews&amp;utm_campaign=CDAQspWt0aOL99lsGPeQp6Hnw_mspQEqDwgAKgcICjCO64oDMJavPA&amp;utm_content=related&amp;gaa_at=g&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj2070ceV5niWLiExz7RE6uqIscvHvFTwlASZjfdaIZDJ2TwX8FRRCWk55LxUyicaxQPQ25azo74ocH5pU8rHhCmNd0l0SrXjkLvZyd&amp;gaa_ts=68817188&amp;gaa_sig=FDeQQB0pPPY6GmEQ04nFWesgmVcQDaCT4UAJeHrOWle61WGf2D-tp0pqldaLrNruTgZ6mi9JxAvwOFLYbm0xWQ%3D%3D">wanting to date men</a> (it’s me, I am poor female soul). When they don’t seem checked out, they’re busy telling you the elaborate details of how their marriage collapsed over intimacy issues. Or confiding in you about their secret plans to make everyone in their polycule very unhappy. Maybe they won’t stop talking about video games (which can go either way, really). Or, as upcoming indie narrative game <i>DateBoy</i> simulates, maybe the guy you’re dating won’t stop <i>playing</i> video games. Ugh, my eyes are up here, buddy.</p> <p>Developed by brothers Anton and Henri Pätsi, <i>DateBoy</i> casts you in the role of a boy on a date at an Italian restaurant who is Checked Out™, too busy playing video games under the table while his off-screen date struggles to carry on a conversation. It’s a free narrative game out on Steam and Itch.io next month and it looks delightfully amusing. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Ezkq3qqwUu4">the trailer here</a>:</p>

  <p>Essentially you play as a dude on a date, trying to play a platformer that bears a passing resemblance to <i>Gimmick!</i> on a device that’s probably legally distinct from a certain beloved late ‘90s handheld console. While hopping around in the platformer, you’ll have to try and keep up with the usual, tired dating conversational topics such as “How was your day?” with opportunities to deliver those one-word answers that us girls <i>love </i>hearing on a night out.</p> <p>Oh well. At least there’s pizza.</p> <p>The game promises to be no longer than half an hour. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4022300/DateBoy/">The Steam listing</a> makes for an amusing read, too. So if you’re looking for what seems to be a cute narrative joint, maybe mark this one on your calendar and try not to stand it up.</p>

Both games--and an interactive streaming series called Silent Hill Townfall--were first announced in a 2022 livestream, and series producer Motoi Okamoto recently spoke about how this was a deliberate move on Konami's part to show fans of the franchise that it was committed to reviving Silent Hill.</p><p>"Three years ago, in 2022, we announced three titles--Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill F, and Silent Hill: Townfall," Okamoto said in a <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1979174851308032466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a> (via an <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-series-producer-says-publishers-cant-expect-players-to-get-serious-about-an-ip-with-just-remakes/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> translation). "We didn't want to just announce a single remake to 'test the waters.' We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series. Developing a remake and a new title simultaneously naturally involves risks, but we wanted to convey our commitment first and foremost. Only when a new game is announced can the future of a series be seen."</p>

<p>Okamoto added that players would not feel motivated to give a new game in a long-running series a chance if the company behind it was adopting a "wait-and-see" approach, and only by approaching the IP with a serious intent could it get the fanbase for that game to engage with it.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/">Silent Hill F</a> have been critically acclaimed entries in the franchise, and there's still more to come.

			<p>I’m not really convinced that we, as a species, are capable of learning from our mistakes. Whether that’s because of real-world events making satire completely redundant, or the fact that people keep building theme parks full of monstrous, toothy reptiles and being surprised when they’re found meandering around with the leg of a guest hanging out of their maw, it’s hard to say. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> continues as the digital incarnation of that theme, but there’s more emphasis on the wellbeing of these creatures than ever before, while giving you the most advanced customisation tools the series has ever seen. Don’t worry, though, because the dinosaurs still get out, and Jeff Goldblum will continue to berate you for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3VojIHYpDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Most people will use the Campaign to get a foothold on JWE3’s revised park building, and Cabot Finch returns as the slightly bemused head of a new dinosaur conservation organisation, the Dinosaur Integration Network. After the more fast-paced, action-oriented campaign of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/05/jurassic-world-evolution-2-review/">JWE2</a>, this time out sees you returning to a more traditional park-building campaign setup, with a series of rundown parks and specific scenarios to work your way through. While I definitely enjoyed the change of pace last time out, the Campaign here is a real return to form, with a well-tuned level of difficulty, more longevity and more emphasis placed on the Contract system to drive you forward.</p>


<p>I can see people really digging in for the long haul with it and bringing every park up to 5-star level. As an introduction to the game’s systems, with some enjoyable narrative drive provided by the fully-voiced cast, it’s perfectly weighted, even if it feels like we’re swinging away from the celluloid timeline in the process.</p>


<p>The park-building has had some thoughtful upgrades made to it, with many of the controls and customisation options bringing JWE3 more in line with Frontier’s other, more realistic, park builders. That means that you can now build more organic enclosures, utilising scenery, such as mountains and crevasses, to form walls and barriers, while the new building blocks of scenery can also form part, or whole enclosures, giving everything a more personal and unique feel.</p>
<p>That personality extends to the updated customisation options for all the different building types in the game. There’s a host of building designs for each building type, and you can now change almost every aspect of a building’s appearance, from the colours of individual panels to the type of lights hanging outside. You can also add a vast number of decorations or create new ones, and because buildings are modular, you can construct unique structures.</p>
<p>There’s an incredible number of possibilities, and with a little thought and artistic flair, you can make your park look truly distinctive. If you love to tinker, this is the park builder for you, and once you have, you can share your designs with the community in the Workshop. If you’re less creative, you can already download a bunch of designs created by game reviewers and Jurassic World Evolution streamers, and I can only imagine how quickly the library will blossom once the game is out.</p>

<p>Alongside the islands created for this game, and a selection of legacy islands from its predecessor, Jurassic World Evolution 3 adds a new island generator to the Sandbox mode, allowing you to bring all your borderline-dangerous visions to life. Sliders let you alter the shape of your creation, the amount of water, the number of mountains and the level of trees that grow across it. This framework is then shareable, via a unique DNA code, if you want to try out a friend’s layout, or have a go at your favourite YouTuber’s creation.</p>
<p>Not every island immediately looks perfect. The mountains, in particular, seem a little off if you maximise the number to include, and open spaces can feel a bit barren at first, but this is just a starting point, a blank canvas to help you unleash your inner John Hammond. It’s more than possible to create a great-looking island footprint, and it really helps to give you a true sense of ownership over your lovingly created park when you’ve had a hand in every aspect of it. Alongside the power of terraforming, and being able to create features like waterfalls, JWE3’s islands and parks are more diverse, detailed and deep than ever before. It’s exactly what we wanted from another Jurassic World Evolution sequel.</p>

<p>We’re here for the dinosaurs, of course. Jurassic World Evolution 3’s biggest addition to the formula is juvenile dinos, with younger members of a herd having a different set of needs and accommodations to make, while you’re still balancing all the other desires of a herd of Triceratops. You can help to tailor more positive genes, starting from the parents, and filtering those down to their offspring, and it adds to the sensation that these younger dinosaurs are wholly yours, creating the environment for breeding, and then nurturing and raising them after they’re born.</p>
<p>With differentiated male and female dinos alongside the juveniles, this adds some further variation to your paddocks, and the dinosaurs as a whole look even more realistic and extraordinary than before. One of the greatest joys of Jurassic World Evolution is just zooming in on a single Gallimimus or T-Rex, and watching them go about their business, and that’s better than ever in JWE3, with revised behaviours and dinosaurs that feel more realistic than before.</p>

<p>As a whole, the visuals have seen a mild bump in detail and definition, while performance on PS5 is largely very good, remaining smooth through most situations. You can start to make the occasional hit to the frame rate as your park grows bigger, especially if you play around with water, but the team have found a good balance between dynamic resolution and the pop-in of ground details and scenery as you get closer, to keep things feeling reliable. It does feel as though there should be a choice between fidelity and graphics modes on PS5 – all you’re getting is toggles for Depth of Field and Motion Blur – but I can live without it.</p>

            <p>
Publishers Slitherine and developers The Artistocrats have launched one of those high-fadoodling "2.0" updates for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starship-troopers-terran-command">Starship Troopers - Terran Command</a>, their violently arachnophobic real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> from 2022. It introduces Territory Mode, which sees you defending three planets featured in the base game and two expansions, and brags of "a level of personalization and replayability never before seen in Terran Command".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Basically, its reshuffles the game into more of an open-ended roguelite thingy. "Instead of following one scripted mission after another, players now decide where and how to strike the Bugs and wipe out their nests in an open strategic campaign," Sky Marshal Rosco J. Press Release bellows in my ear. "Battles can be fought across the galaxy, with each planet offering its own distinct set of maps, objectives, and unique Arachnid threats--ensuring that no two campaigns ever feel the same."
</p>
<p>
In Territory Mode, you'll have to secure and defend Territory Points that generate income of a new resource that is used to recruit units, reinforce squads, and unlock new techs. The opposing Arachnids, meanwhile, will grow in power as the campaign goes on.
</p>
<p>
Territory Mode also divides the existing base game and DLC units, turrets and abilities into Battle Groups, which "function like specialized factions" and add "character-based elements and super innovative tactical options to every deployment".
</p>
<p>
It all sounds reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>'s post-release Kingdom Mode, albeit not quite as lavish in its reframing. The requirement that you own the DLC to get full use of Territory Mode is obnoxious - there are 11 maps in the base game, nine maps in the Raising Hell DLC, and seven maps in the Urban Onslaught DLC. All the units for each Battle Group are split across the DLCs as well.  
</p><p>
Still, we liked the original Terran Command, with Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starship-trooper-terran-command-review">calling it</a> a "solid, slightly chaotic RTS that nails some satisfying tactical stand up bugfights, but could use a little more bite". The original game and DLC are on discount till October 28th. You can buy the whole lot for £39.13, €45.47 or $46.77. Would <em>you</em> like to know more? Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/">Steam</a> page, then.

<p>
Slitherine are calling Terran Command's second com(mand)ing the heart of an "RTS Renaissance", which also apparently includes their Cameron-era roboherder Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance and Steel Balalaika's recent Broken Arrow, which I hadn't heard of till now, and which doesn't appear to have John Travolta in it.</p>
<p>"Slitherine has truly become the essential home for all RTS enthusiasts, and our continuous free support is how we repay the passion of this community," beams publishing director Marco Alessandro Minoli. "We are here to ensure that the genre thrives." Inspiring! Do you feel like we're in an RTS Renaissance? I am declaring this the Renaissance of overcompensatory PR.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review.1330378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Imagine a superhero game where you’re not the one flying into danger in a cape or a suit. Instead, you’re stuck behind a desk. That’s the vibe of Dispatch, an episodic adventure game where each episode lasts roughly an hour. You play as Robert Robertson (voiced by Aaron Paul), better known as Mecha Man, whose mech suit has been destroyed. Now, he finds himself managing a squad of, let’s say, unique, reformed villains at the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN).</p>



<p>Available on PC and PlayStation 5, Dispatch is part strategy, part narrative, part workplace comedy. I like to think of it as a primetime office drama with superpowers. You’ll choose who to send where, dealing with egos the size of Los Angeles, and try to pull off heroics from the sidelines. But how does it all work, and does developer AdHoc Studio manage to capture the charm that had people fall in love with games like The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, and Batman: The Enemy Within?</p>



<h2 id="h-dispatch-spoiler-free-review-episodes-1-amp-2">Dispatch Spoiler-Free Review: Episodes 1 &amp; 2</h2>



<p>The first thing you notice with Dispatch is just how beautiful the game looks. It gives off Invincible vibes, but with a bit more polish to the environment, shadows, lighting, and more. It’s not going to appeal to everyone, but, to me, it’s one of the best-looking games of the year.</p>



<p>At the start of Episode 1, you find out who Mecha Man is and why you end up losing your suit. From a gameplay standpoint, things are a slow build. The first episode is more about getting you into the feeling of how things will go as opposed to diving into the full experience. You’ll meet important characters like Blonde Blazer, Chase, and the group of “heroes” you’ll be managing. </p>



<p>From the get-go, you feel the weight of everything in front of you, from the emotional state of Robertson and the loss of identity to what the SDN is trying to accomplish. Part of a government project known as Phoenix, this <s>Suicide Squad</s> Z-Team of former villains all have unique track records and abilities that you need to learn. There are five different stats to be aware of with your team: Combat, Charisma, Intelligence, Strength, and Vigor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The core gameplay loop is simple but satisfying: dispatch your team of “reformed” villains to handle a variety of situations. You’ll need to decide whose skills and abilities are the best fit for the job. Some are as simple as helping someone across the road, while others require you to try and put out blazing infernos. Each character has their share of strengths and weaknesses, with some even working well together on multi-person dispatches. </p>



<p>At the end of your shift, you get a recap of how successful your dispatches were and how the team improved.</p>



<p>Dispatch includes quick-time events (QTEs) during cinematic sequences, though thankfully, they can be toggled off. Personally, I recommend it because it can get a bit distracting to deal with during the game. If I had to find one main complaint, it’s that the QTEs just feel like something that was added for the sake of putting more in the game. They don’t really add anything to the experience.</p>



<p>Another area of the gameplay is the hacking minigames. Through two episodes, they are few and far between, but still provide a nice break during various moments of the story. As the game moves forward, the hope is that not only will there be more instances of them, but they’ll actually provide a challenge.</p>



<h2>A Story Worth Loving With Great Acting To Boot</h2>



<p>With this being a game from a studio of former Telltale Game employees, it’s no surprise that Dispatch leans heavily into branching choices and dialogue. It’s hard to talk more about the choices you make without spoiling anything, so I won’t go into what the options you get are. </p>



<p>What I will say, however, is that you don’t get to the point where they all matter too much just yet through two episodes. Every choice you make—the game tells you that various characters will remember what you say and do—sets up something, and it feels like we’re left waiting a bit longer for what that something is. And that’s not a complaint because some decisions do impact what happens immediately after, but you can tell when the bigger ones are being made. It adds to that feeling of wanting more that Adhoc is clearly going for here.</p>



<figure><figcaption>In the early stages of Dispatch episodes 1 &amp; 2, you get a quick introduction to most of the characters.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you listen to the dialogue and watch scenes unfold in each, it’s easy to tell that Dispatch is a game that knows when to be serious while at the same time bringing in a nice blend of sarcasm and humor to it all. It didn’t even take half of the first episode to realize how perfect Paul’s casting was for the role of Robertson.</p>



<p>In fact, every voice actor fits their character so well. Jeffrey Wright nails the crass attitude of Chase, while Charles “MoistCr1TiKaL” White’s voice captures the arrogance of Sonar, who might be one of my favorite characters so far, despite limited screentime through two episodes. Hell, even the seemingly harmless scene with Royd in the bathroom shows the personality of Dispatch at every level.</p>



<p>Of course, things can go off the rails over the next six episodes, so a follow-up review and final verdict—with some spoilers—on Dispatch will come after the final episodes are released on November 12. Until then, I can’t wait to see how the rest of Robertson’s story unfolds.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/edenspark-war-thunder-devs-gaijin-entertainment-open-source-ai-assisted-game-making/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-thunder-devs-reveal-edenspark-an-open-source-ai-assisted-game-making-platform.1330354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Gaijin Entertainment, the studio behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/">War Thunder,</a> Modern Warships, Aces of Thunder, and MWT: Tank Battles, has announced EdenSpark, a new open-source platform where, along with an AI assistant, users can create games and make them accessible "<em>to console users hassle-free</em>" and "<em>truly own the code of their creations</em>."</p>



<p>The trailer frames EdenSpark as the platform that simplifies the game-making process with "<em>easy 3D modelling</em>," whatever that's supposed to mean, and that, with the help of its simplified toolset and AI assistant, you can "<em>create a game, and play it instantly on consoles</em>." </p>



<p><a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/edenspark-will-open-a-new-path-for-indie-developers-on-consoles">A blog post</a> on Gaijin Entertainment's official website speaks a little more clearly about EdenSpark, though the framing is generally the same, as EdenSpark is described as a new platform "<em>designed to lower the barriers to game development</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EdenSpark — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8JN9lKh5V4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark gives individual game creators an easy access to consoles, even without a registered company or costly legal paperwork. Anyone will be able to turn their idea into a game and share it with friends on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox</em>," Gaijin Entertainment writes. </p>



<p>"<em>At the same time, unlike closed ecosystems offering similar experiences, EdenSpark developers will retain full ownership of their games. This means that creators can keep their projects inside EdenSpark's community or, if they wish, self-publish independently, taking their work anywhere. This combination of accessibility and freedom is unique: major engines might offer professional flexibility, but they either don't help you [bring your game] to console audience fast and easy or are not available under FOSS, or neither. EdenSpark bridges the gap</em>."</p>



<p>Essentially, it seems like EdenSpark is a platform that users will be able to create games on their PC or console, and begin playing the game they just made, something akin to MediaMolecule's Dreams. It seems to go further, though, because it's not all one stylistic look, and if you wanted to take that game and properly publish it on the PlayStation or Xbox store, you'd be able to do just that.</p>



<p>So, if all you wanted to do was make a game and have people play it on their consoles, EdenSpark purports to be able to do that. But it's unclear if users will be able to monetize their games on EdenSpark, or if they'd have to self-publish in order to make money selling the games they made with EdenSpark. It's also unclear if, even with Gaijin Entertainment repeatedly saying that users will "<em>own</em>" the code their games are built on, Gaijin Entertainment would still ask for a cut of any profits made from games created on its platform.</p>



<p>It also seems like the AI assistant is a huge part of EdenSpark achieving its goal to "<em>lower the barriers to game development</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Experienced</em> <em>programmers can dive deep into code, while complete newcomers can rely on AI-assisted tools to generate art, sound, and gameplay logic, or simply build worlds using plain prompts. It's even possible to create games using a retail console</em>,<em> with a keyboard being the only extra accessory you'll need</em>. <em>EdenSpark is powered by Gaijin's Dagor Engine, the proven technology powering blockbuster titles such as War Thunder, Enlisted and Active Matter, ensuring professional-grade performance for projects of any scale</em>."</p>



<p>At some point in November 2025, Gaijin Entertainment will host a closed beta where users in the beta can take a look at several "<em>game prototypes</em>" and play around with EdenSpark before it launches into its 1.0 version sometime in Summer 2026, according to the <a href="https://edenspark.io/en">roadmap on the platform's official website</a>. The AI assistant for EdenSpark will also only be available in its 1.0 launch.</p>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark is more than just another game creation kit,</em>" added Anton Yudintsev, Gaijin Entertainment's co-founder. "<em>It’s the first platform that truly opens consoles to solo developers, while guaranteeing they remain the owners of their games. Whether you want to share a funny prototype with friends or build a real career as an independent studio, EdenSpark gives you both the tools and the freedom.”</em></p>



<p>At this point, it's too early to say with confidence if EdenSpark will be anything of note in the games industry or not. There are already free game-making platforms that let people jump into game development with plenty of tutorials and assistance to help make it as easy as possible. EdenSpark claims to be a new level of ease-of-use, partly because you can use it on any PlayStation or Xbox console you'd grab at your local retailer, instead of having to swing for a development kit.</p>



<p>It's not a bad concept, realistically, there are just a lot of variables left unanswered, like if EdenSpark will let users monetize the games they make within the EdenSpark ecosystem, whether Gaijin Entertainment would ask for a cut of profits for games made with EdenSpark that do get self-published, and perhaps most importantly, how easy to use EdenSpark really is, and if users really could create games that hit the necessary quality bar that makes players want to pay for them. Or, if EdenSpark becomes the new home for anyone looking to make the kinds of AI-slop games we already see filling digital storefronts, only now they get churned out even faster than before.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-friends-advent-calendar-is-the-only-one-left-now-selling-42-off-on-amazon-2000637620</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO released its 2025 Advent calendars just a few weeks ago, and they’re already vanishing from Amazon’s shelves at an alarming rate. The<strong> Lego City calendar is completely sold out</strong>, <strong>Minecraft has disappeared</strong>&nbsp;and most other themes have either limited stock or inflated prices. Surprisingly, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/">Lego Friends Advent Calendar remains available and has dropped to an all-time low of $20, down from its original $34 price</a>. For parents trying to stretch holiday budgets while keeping the magic alive through December, this is one of those deals that won’t last long once word gets out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Advent calendars solve a specific parenting challenge every December: Kids need something to channel their excitement during those long weeks leading up to Christmas, and a daily surprise keeps them engaged without the sugar overload of chocolate-filled alternatives. This<strong>&nbsp;set delivers 237 pieces spread across 24 doors, giving children aged six and up</strong> a new building project each morning.</p>
<h2>What’s Different This Year About The Calendar?</h2>
<p>LEGO recently rebranded the Friends theme with greater emphasis on varied storytelling and everyday situations that children are more likely to connect with. This 2025 calendar shows that transition with a holiday sleepover theme that seems more down to earth than releases from earlier years. The package <strong>contains five mini-dolls: Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo</strong>&nbsp;who come with sleeping mats that complete a whole indoor campout setup. The choice of characters reflects varied personality types and interests so that children may enter the narrative on several different levels.</p>



<p>The animal companions add another layer of play value: <strong>Two dogs, a guinea pig, a gecko, and a cat</strong> come with their own accessories like food stations, water dispensers, scratching posts and pet beds. Each animal’s accessories are scaled to match the mini-doll world so kids can actually integrate them into ongoing play scenarios beyond December.</p>



<p>The day-by-day builds range from tiny accessories in early December to larger interactive pieces as we build up to Christmas. Early dates may open with wrapped gift boxes or a table lamp, while later dates open up the fireplace with flame elements, a working sled with space for a minidoll, and a life-sized LEGO reindeer figure. The karaoke machine features a microphone piece that is compatible with a minidoll’s hand, and the hot chocolate stand includes mugs proportionate to the figures.</p>
<p>The scene-building potential extends well past December 25th. The sofa seats two minidolls comfortably, the Christmas tree comes with decorative elements that can be rearranged, and the hobbyhorse has a spring mechanism built into its base. These aren’t single-use holiday decorations. They <strong>become permanent additions to any existing LEGO Friends collection, compatible with playsets like the Heartlake City buildings</strong> and vehicles sold separately.</p>
<p>At $20, this calendar is cheaper than several single LEGO Friends expansion packs while offering more variety. The retail price of $34 already offered good value compared to purchasing single blind bags or accessory packs over the course of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Selling autographed merchandise has become so lucrative that celebrities and athletes are told </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-very-important-reason-celebrities-wont-use-blue-pens-for-autographs_uk_658059cee4b08e9b410b51f7"><span>not to sign anything with blue ink</span></a><span> because it’s believed that this makes their John Hancock easier to scan and forge. It’s true that if you don’t actually see someone sign something in front of you, it’s pretty difficult to verify if a signature is legitimate, so it’s good to be cautious when buying signed merchandise from a third party. Luckily some public figures, like </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>director Yoko Taro, are willing to call out phonies peddling fake autographs for profit.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fan on X sent Taro a screenshot of a now-deleted auction of an autographed </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>soundtrack CD that the director had seemingly signed. At a glance, you wouldn’t know that it was forged. It even has a little sketch of Emil, a character from the </span><i><span>Nier</span></i><span> series whose mask Taro wears during public appearances and that he often includes in his signatures. However, Taro himself replied that “nearly half” of the items for sale that are ostensibly bearing his signature are forged, including the one the fan had originally sent. After Taro put it on blast, the original auction listing was taken down.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine. I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.<br>（◎血◎） <a href="https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo">https://t.co/yQVeoYQcfo</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1980304441493582021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Taro says he includes “small, unknown features” in his signature to identify forgeries. A fan posted an image of Taro’s real signature as seen at a Square Enix event, and the differences are subtle but noticeable upon comparison. The R is longer, and the Y is kind of squiggly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">heres a real signature to compare everyone from the square enix cafe <a href="https://t.co/Heahqg06bI">pic.twitter.com/Heahqg06bI</a></p> <p>— la reina (rena) 🌽🐓🐟💀🐅😊 (@ashykitten_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashykitten_/status/1980400732768817636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Well, that’s another scammer’s day ruined, at least. Hopefully, now that </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>fans have been made aware of this, they won’t buy any fake Yoko Taro autographs. It’s also possible that forgeries get better now that those looking to make a quick buck know what to look for. So be careful out there, y’all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Normally, this is where I’d talk about what Taro is working on right now, but we don’t really know, actually. I just finished a replay of </span><i><span>Nier: Automata, </span></i><span>and as much as I know people want more of those games, I’m pretty content with where it all ended. Hopefully Square Enix is considering giving </span><i><span>Nier Reincarnation </span></i><span>the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687"><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>treatment</span></a><span> to bring it to consoles, given that the gacha game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><span>no longer playable</span></a><span> but contains a lot of major story revelations. </span></p>

<p>A new Futurama mod is breathing fresh life into the 2003 classic, The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run. Developed by Slurm Team, Futurama Hit &amp; Run transforms Springfield into an almost identical recreation of New New York.</p>



<p>According to the developers, the mod was created with <strong>“all fully from scratch 3D models, built from the ground up like it was an intended expansion pack for the game.” </strong></p>



<p>It’s even got the attention of the original game’s lead designer Joe McGinn, who said, <strong>“I can only say … this looks awesome! I want to play it.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mod is currently available to <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download as a free demo</a> and features four story missions, a bonus mission, four races, six vehicles, and more. The current map is roughly a quarter of New New York.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the team used AI-generated dialogue for aspects of the mod due to the series’ voice actors not being able to participate in its creation.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-didn-t-the-simpsons-hit-amp-run-2-happen">Why Didn’t The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run 2 Happen?</h2>



<p>With a new mod for the classic game, it obviously leads to the question of why fans didn’t get a The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run 2? As it turns out, development on a sequel was actually underway after the success of the original. Unfortunately, the original game’s publisher, Vivendi, lost the license for the franchise and turned down a deal to make more games. </p>



<p><strong>“The Simpsons came back with an offer for five games for X amount of dollars — a really good deal — and Vivendi said ‘No.’,”</strong>&nbsp;former executive producer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-didnt-we-get-the-simpsons-hit-run-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Melchior said back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Ridgeline Games was instrumental in the beginning of Battlefield 6, but the studio was closed midway through the game’s production following the voluntary departure of former director and VP Marcus Lehto. The former visionary has revealed that several members of the team were left out of the Battlefield 6 credits—including himself.</p>



<p>It’s never a nice feeling for your work to go unappreciated. This appears to be the case for several members of the now-defunct Ridgeline Games team, who worked tirelessly on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-former-battlefield-6-director-criticizes-game-for-not-acknowledging-former-devs">Former Battlefield 6 Director Criticizes Game For Not Acknowledging Former Devs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not good. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-lehto-7378b31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marcus Lehto</a> was a “Studio GM/VP” for Battlefield between 2021 and 2024. He led Ridgeline Games—formed in 2022—with the specific purpose of working on Battlefield 6—before walking away in 2024.</p>



<p>Lehto <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386081189645885440/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> to LinkedIn on October 20 to say: “Many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6.”</p>



<p>The former talent posted an edited version of the Battlefield 6 credits, featuring the devs who were omitted. It also highlights that anyone who was recognized was simply saved for a “Special Thanks” section toward the end of the credits. </p>



<p>Lehto called this out:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered. Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a “Special Thanks” section at the very end of the credits — and several were omitted entirely, including myself.</p><p>Out of respect for my colleagues and the awesome work they poured into this project, I want to take a moment to properly recognize them — listing their names and roles as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits.</p><p>Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments section, for the most part, was nothing but love for Lehto and his team, and condemnation for the credits leaving out all the missing talents.</p>

More specifically, the "Kirby Air Riders Direct 2," as Nintendo calls it, will begin at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET on Thursday, October 23, and feature roughly 60 minutes of information about the game. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/19/nintendo-details-kirby-air-riders-and-its-november-release-date">Like the first one that aired in August</a>, Kirby Air Riders director Masahiro Sakurai will host the presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>During the last direct, we learned more about the game's roster, which includes Kirby, Meta Knight, Waddle Dee, King Deedeedee, and many more, the second button players can use in the game, two gameplay modes, and the November 20 release date. As for what to expect during this second direct, it's anybody's guess. Of course, there's still plenty to learn about the game but considering the August direct lasted 45 minutes, we've already learned so much about Kirby Air Riders. Nonetheless, we'll be tuning in this Thursday.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/oJVsNMp_nAU?si=ueniAhK4JHBUVINx" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJVsNMp_nAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to learn about Kirby Air Riders during this Direct?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Few games live in my head quite like the ones in the Persona series, and among them there is a clear pantheon of greats. Though there are just five main series games, the true number of games is significantly higher thanks to spin-offs and rereleases that are slightly different to the original.&nbsp;Persona 3 Reload is one of those slightly different rereleases, and now it’s been re-rereleased with a Switch 2 port.</p>
<p><iframe title="Persona 3 Reload — Announce Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vgpmt-54Rjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back at the start of 2024, I gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">a whopping 9/10</a> for being a completely revamped Persona 3 experience that was the best possible version of the game, though not quite the definitive one thanks to the omission of the playable female main character (FeMC, as she’s known online) from previous iterations.</p>


<p>For those who don’t know it, you play a teenager who is tasked with saving humanity. There’s a lot of adult themes here, including most notably, death and suicide. This game isn’t for everyone, but if after watching the trailer you’re curious, it will almost certainly get its hooks in you. If nothing else, the soundtrack has been playing in my head since last January.</p>
<p>So, how does the Switch 2 edition compare?</p>


<p>To paraphrase the great Igor, who famously resides in a place that exists between mind and matter, dream and reality, this game very firmly sits between the PS4 and PS5 version of the game.</p>
<p>To be clear: this is a carbon copy of last January’s release, scaled to Nintendo’s newest console. There’s no FeMC, but it comes with all the quality of life upgrades that we mentioned in the previous review. This game is incredible — that is not up for debate, you should absolutely play it — but it’s not perfect on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Performance wise, we’re somewhere between the PS4 and PS5 editions of Reload, which is what you’d expect for an anime game locked at 30fps. Is it as pretty as the PS5 version? No, absolutely not. There are issues with frame drops that have been picked up by the community following the demo’s launch, and these have already caught the ear of the developers, including Yoshihiro Komori, who told <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/atlus-to-address-persona-3-reloads-switch-2-frame-rate-hiccups-in-future-patches">Nintendo Life</a> that “We are currently taking steps to improve [the frame rate drops]. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game’s release but will be in future patches.”</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help to steady that 30fps down the line, but is it a significant problem for launch?&nbsp; Probably not — this isn’t a photorealistic, high-intensity game. If you’re buying it for the Switch 2, it’s either because you want the portability and convenience, or because you don’t own a more powerful console. If this is a major issue for you, consider getting the game on something more powerful.</p>

<p>Frame rate aside, it actually looks pretty good on the Switch 2. It plays well on handheld and I’ve enjoyed having it on the big screen as well (the same one my PS5 is connected to). Other than some choppy frames during cutscenes, I haven’t really considered turning off the Switch to jump back on the PS5, so that’s a vote of confidence for anyone worried about performance.</p>
<p>This brings us onto the most pertinent question: is it worth buying Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2?</p>
<p>I’d say absolutely, yes, with the caveat that you don’t own a more powerful machine. At this point, it’s going to be cheaper on the PS5 and it frankly looks better. If you don’t own a PS5 and you haven’t already played it, though,&nbsp;I strongly recommend picking up Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2, either now or once a performance patch has arrived.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload on Switch 2 is a great opportunity to play an incredible game on the go. While there’s compromises to the game on more powerful consoles, and it needs a performance patch, my commutes got a lot more interesting having this in my bag.</p>
