            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is furthering its partnership with AMD so they can create more AI-powered technology to make games look and play better — and not just on PlayStation hardware. The two companies are establishing a “deeper collaboration” to work on “Machine Learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay,” lead architect of the PS5 and PS5 Pro Mark Cerny <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/18/ps5-pro-technical-seminar-reveals-new-in-depth-details-on-console/">announced on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>The two already partner on the PS5 and PS5 Pro’s GPUs, which are based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture, and the PS5 Pro uses a feature called PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) to improve image clarity and frame rates.</p><p>Sony also released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMwXJsMfIQ">a 37-minute presentation by Cerny</a> discussing technical aspects of the PS5 Pro and some additional information about the “multi-year” project with AMD, which is codenamed “Amethyst.” The two are vague about how, when, and where the tech resulting from Project Amethyst will be used, but general it sounds like it’s something we could see on the next PlayStation and other future hardware that AMD is a part of.</p><div><p>“These components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics”</p></div><p>The companies have two goals with Project Amethyst, according to Cerny. “The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning,” Cerny said, including something that’s particularly good at dealing with the lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for game graphics.</p><p>The second goal is to develop “a set of high-quality CNNs for graphics,” Cerny said. “Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing.”</p><p>Sony and AMD don’t want this technology to be exclusive to PlayStation. “Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices,” Cerny said. That means “something that can be used broadly across PC and console and cloud,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mark-cerny-on-ps5-pro-flopflation-and-playstations-partnership-with-amd">Cerny said to <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>The fruits of this work seem like they’re a ways out, though: “Don’t expect some massive hardware announcement immediately coming out of this,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald">Cerny told <em>Digital Foundry</em></a>. And since creating a console is “roughly a four year-journey,” Cerny said during the presentation, it’s possible we might not see hardware that uses tech from Project Amethyst until the PlayStation 6. (Cerny dodged a direct question from <em>IGN</em> about when we should expect a potential PS6.)</p><p>If you want to read more of what Cerny said about Amethyst in his presentation, here’s the transcript of that part (which starts at <a href="https://youtu.be/lXMwXJsMfIQ?si=n0E37ABklN1FMxTo&amp;t=2072">around 34:32 in the video</a>):</p><div><blockquote><p>I have some very exciting news to share. We have begun a deeper collaboration with AMD. For the project name we’re taking a hint from AMD’s red and PlayStation’s blue. The code name is Amethyst.</p><p>With Amethyst, we’ve started on another long journey and are combining our expertise with two goals in mind.</p><p>The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning. Something capable of generalized processing of neural networks but particularly good at the lightweight CNNs needed for game graphics and something focused around achieving that Holy Grail of fully-fused networks.</p><p>In going after this we’re combining the lessons AMD has learned from its multi-generation RDNA road map and SIE has learned from the custom work in PS5 Pro.</p><p>But ML use in games shouldn’t and can’t be restricted to graphics libraries. We’re also working towards a democratization of machine learning something accessible that allows direct work in AI and ML by game developers both for graphics and for gameplay.</p><p>Amethyst is not about proprietary technology for PlayStation. In fact it’s the exact opposite. Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices.</p><p>The other goal is to develop, in parallel, a set of highquality CNNs for game graphics. Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing.</p><p>We’re looking forward to keeping you posted throughout what we anticipate to be a multi-year collaboration.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The good news is the multiplayer game is getting <em>Killzone </em>Helghast  skins as it approaches its one-year anniversary. The bad news is the entire bundle of virtual cosmetics costs $20, half the price of the paid game itself. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196653,195371" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“We decided a long time ago to do crossovers only if and when they make perfect sense for the game,” the development team wrote in a new blog post on Steam. “So in that spirit, we’re hyped to announce our very first crossover: <em>Killzone 2</em>. <em>Helldivers 2</em> x<em> Killzone 2</em> belongs to a new tier of special Premium content reserved for collaborations and other uniquely-themed work. Our plan is to offer you something distinct and special.”</p><p>The premium collaboration comes at a premium price, however. Buying everything in the set costs 1,975 Super Credits, an in-game currency players can slowly earn while playing or pay roughly $20 per 2,100 for. That makes the <em>Killzone</em> set the most expensive gear you can currently purchase in the <em>Starship Troopers</em>-inspired alien shooter, a game regularly priced at $40 with battle passes called Warbonds that include many more unlockables for just $10 each. </p><figure id="" data-id="eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-recommend-id="image://eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-format="png" data-width="1894" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows new items for purchase in Helldivers 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After several years of skin-flation across popular live-service games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em>, $15-$20 has become the new norm for crossover skins that bring in popular outside characters and styles. But unlike those games, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is not free-to-play and has already set a certain precedent for its in-game pricing system. Within that existing framework, the Helghast tributes look great but feel way overpriced. They’re also only in the shop for five days, meaning players can’t even take their time trying to grind for Super Credits across hundreds of missions. </p><p>“No set should costs over 1000sc,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one thread</a></span> currently shooting up to the top of the<em> Helldivers 2</em> subreddit. “Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR?? They seriously add a new gun and lock it behind a 600sc paywall!?” Another player responded that the<em> Killzone</em> set should have been its own Warbond instead, with more content and a lower price point at the cost of having to unlock each piece individually. </p><p>Others have pointed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/new_gear_just_dropped/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/new_gear_just_dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to a slippery slope</a></span> where red lines for <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s in-game shop have gradually been crossed. At first it was only cosmetic armor, later stratagems, the cool arsenal of war machinery that fuels the gameplay, were added to a paid Warbond, and recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hekecs/dont_sell_weapons_in_the_shop/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hekecs/dont_sell_weapons_in_the_shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weapons have made it into the shop’s FOMO rotation</a></span>. Players who have purchased every Warbond since the game launched without using free credits would have spent $90 by this point.</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani took to the game’s Discord to try and diffuse the situation. “Hey - quick comment on the Helghast stuff,” he wrote on Wednesday. “Firstly - this is our first collaboration so we’ll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you’d like to see in the future. Secondly it’s optional - the more of this we sell - the more illuminate type stuff we can keep dropping for free.”</p><p>The suggestion that players need to swallow higher prices in order to keep getting free updates didn’t go over to well. “You cannot be serious,” wrote one player in response. “These prices are fucking egregious. Your game is NOT FREE. We have already paid, you don’t get to hide behind a 20 dollar skin as if that makes the difference.” Jorjani simply wrote back, “noted!”</p><p>One of the biggest games of 2024, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has previously butted heads with its community a couple of times this year. The first was over a controversial PSN login requirement on Steam that saw the game’s rating review-bombed to smithereens until it reversed course. The second was a series of patches nerfing some of players’ favorite gear and loadouts, including things they’d purchased from paid Warbonds, which eventually lead the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269">to commit to an apology tour</a></span> of buffing things instead and focusing on addressing performance, stability, and other issues in the meantime. </p><p>That recent revival was capped off with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">the free Omens of Tyranny update this month</a></span>, that added the game’s third Illuminate faction and new urban warfare maps. It’s a great new chapter in the game’s ongoing Galactic War whose fanfare might be cut short by the bungled <em>Killzone </em>skin rollout, even if the studio was banking on those to help pay for it. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>XDefiant is preparing for the ultimate wind-down ahead of its inevitable closure in just a few months. It was recently confirmed by Ubisoft that XDefiant will be taken offline on June 3, 2025, but before then, the team has pushed out one final patch that includes a staggering amount of content.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1869382398929965418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> and confirmed by Mark Rubin on Twitter, the season three update for XDefiant includes additional content from <strong>the next five seasons</strong>, which will otherwise never see the light of day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-a-farewell">What a Farewell</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter, Mark Rubin explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft has not only allowed a small team to stay on and continue working to get our Season 3 content out the door, but we’ve also been able to add some extra content to this release from future seasons. </p>



<p>So, we have our Season 3 content plus some of the content from Season 4, 5, 6,7 and even Season 8. </p>



<p>We are adding 3 new factions this patch with the Assassin’s of course that was planned for Season 3 but also Wolves and Omega Force from Seasons 4 and 5 respectively.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Along with the new factions come six new ‘Arena’ maps and three new ‘Linear’ maps that were planned to be released further down the line. That’s a total of 13 new maps – but if you’ve never downloaded XDefiant, you’ll not be able to access them, which makes them somewhat rare.</p>



<p>This includes a new ‘Rayman map’ that was scheduled for a takeover event midway through season four.</p>



<p>Also, season three marks the arrival of a more esports-focused mode: Defuse. This is the traditional one-life bomb mode that serves as the foundation for games like Rainbow Six Siege and Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>Those still playing will also have access to ‘Lum Hunt’, ‘Tilt’, ‘Turbo XD’, and a vs-bots mode</p>



<p>This is all in addition to new weapons such as the G36K, M1A, and Diceros pistol. Everything that was added behind battle passes has been unlocked for the audience still able to access the game.</p>



<p>It’s one hell of an update, but it’s a farewell patch at best for XDefiant.</p>

                <p>There hasn't been a new game in the Marvel vs. Capcom series since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review/1900-6416760/" data-ref-id="1900-6416760">Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</a> was released in 2017. Now, players may have a good reason to come back to that title thanks to an upcoming fan-mod, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond, which gives the game an almost literal fresh coat of paint. Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond will be released on December 20 and will only be available on PC. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PXorZjVETFQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond was originally started by a modder called WistfulHopes before the project was taken over by Maximillian “Maximilian Dood” Christiansen, who assembled a team to create new art and music, as well as a throwback visual style that more closely resembles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds-review/1900-6298807/" data-ref-id="1900-6298807">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a> than Infinite. The results speak for themselves.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/474516/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-beyond-mod-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Christiansen said he spent $30,000 of his own money to pay the artists and programmers who were enlisted for this project. And since this mod will be released for free, Christiansen won't be making any of that back. Regardless, Christiansen told the outlet that he has no regrets over his investment of time and money.</p><p>"Nobody played [Infinite] because of visuals and roster stuff," said Christiansen. "If the one thing that I can do within my power and budgetary scope is to fix the visuals, something that actually makes it look better, [something that] will get people to even play it, that's the goal--for you to go to Steam and buy Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, [download] our mod, and change the game."</p><p>Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite is discounted to $7 at GameSpot sister site Fanatical right now.

			<p>If you're looking for a way to celebrate the festive season in Mortal Kombat 1, then look no longer. It's been announced today by Warner Bros. Games that new holiday-themed in-game events will be arriving at the game from December 19 through to December 30. These events will be staggered across the days, with each event providing different rewards upon completion. The rewards come in the form of new character palettes, of which the details will be provided below. The events comprise five new Towers of Time events, which are free events available to all owners of Mortal Kombat 1. Below are all of the details you need about these events so you can pick and choose which ones you want to participate in based on the character palettes that you can unlock.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloody Snow&nbsp;</strong>Tower (December 19-25) - Yuletide Necromancer &amp; Christmas Evil character palettes for Quan Chi</li>
<li><strong>Naughty List</strong> Tower (December 21-26) - Souls of Winter &amp; Holiday Collection palettes for Ermac</li>
<li><strong>A Christmas Krampus</strong> Tower (December 23-30) Holiday Hero &amp; Winter Wonderman palettes for Takeda</li>
<li><strong>'Twas the Night</strong> Tower (December 25-30) - Angel on High &amp; Holidazzle palettes for Cyrax</li>
<li><strong>Final Present</strong> Tower (December 26-30) - Eat, Drink, and Be Lethal &amp; Bah, Humbug palettes for Sektor</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these character palettes, players will be given the option to purchase new holiday skins for Kameo Fighters Frost and Sareena, as well as the previously released festive skins Santa's Helper Reptile, Krampus General Shao and Mrs. Klause Kitana.</p>
<p>For those who aren't owners of Mortal Kombat 1 yet, there is now the option to purchase the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Kollection, which is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. This collection includes the main Mortal Kombat 1 game, as well as the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion, the previous Kombat Pack, and 1,250 Dragon Krystals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you already own the game but you don't have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">Khaos Reigns content</a>, you can upgrade your version of the game with Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, which will provide you with a new story expansion, as well as Konbat Pack 2, which adds Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot to the game. There are also some new guest fighters on the way that will be added to the game via Kombat Pack 2. This includes Ghostface, who is already in the game, as well as one-week early access to guest fighter Conan the Barbarian, who is set to be released on January 21. T-1000 Terminator is also set to join Mortal Kombat 1 but doesn't yet have an official release date.</p>
<p>What character palettes will you be aiming for this year?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ark-ultimate-mobile-edition-coming-to-ios-android-today-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition has officially launched for free on<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ark-ultimate-mobile-edition/id6639622324" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studiowildcard.arkuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a> today, with the game being completely free to play for those who want to get stuck into the Dino adventure. This announcement came from Grove Street Games and publisher Snail Games in partnership with Studio Wildcard. This is a brand-new free <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">adaptation of ARK</a>, serving as a massive mobile dino-adventure that will include the full-scale experience of ARK: Survival Evolved, as well as the ARK Expansion Packs. This consists of Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, Genesis Parts 1 &amp; 2, and the fan-favorite Ragnarok map that was created by the community. This is just the tip of the dino-shaped iceberg, as there is plenty more that will be available in this mobile adventure, with a promise of thousands of gameplay hours.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to get their games through the Epic Games Store mobile marketplace, it will soon be available there. If you're not sure how ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition is panning out, you can check out the gameplay launch trailer below, which gives you a glimpse into what you can expect. The trailer is just over a minute long, and showcases some of the key features of the game, the same features that are in the PC and console versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U014C9C2X60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition comes with massive worlds for you to explore, with over 150 dinosaurs and creatures to tame and train as your own, as well as multiplayer tribe dynamics so that you can partner up with friends. Of course, it wouldn't be ARK without the crafting and building experience, which you will be able to dive into from the outset. The app launches today with the original ARK Island Map, Scorched Earth, and Aberration expansions. The rest of the expansions will be available for players by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>For those interested, there is also the option to opt-in to a subscription service called the ARK Pass. If you want to subscribe to the ARK Pass, it's available at a $4.99 monthly cost or a $49.99 annual subscription price, whichever is preferable for you. By having access to the ARK Pass, you will get access to every current and future Expansion Pack, as well as monthly bonuses. These bonuses include God Console, giving you access to console commands if you're playing in a single-player, bonus XP in all game modes, monthly drops of free 'Keys,' and exclusive access to servers.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Expansion Packs and features for ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition can also be purchased separately, depending on what you prefer.</p>

So it is that tomorrow’s teaser trailer for the upcoming James Gunn-led relaunch of the DC cinematic universe, <em>Superman</em>, has just received its own teaser trailer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the premise—a piece of marketing material designed to have you intrigued to watch a forthcoming piece of marketing material that’s designed to have you intrigued to watch a film—the resulting diminishing returns are a collection of shots that tell us almost nothing whatsoever about the film it’s all intended to promote. We see reaction shots of people’s astonishment at seeing—presumably—a man who can fly, stop bullets, and leap tall buildings in a single bound. We also see less than a second of the super man himself.</p><p>Well shit, it worked, didn’t it? We posted it.</p><p>Let’s insist we’re doing it as a cultural observation of the sheer audacity of hype, of the fever pitch Warner Bros. and DC Studios are informing us we’ve reached, over finally seeing a tangible glimpse of this movie. They likely wanted that, too.</p><p>What strikes me as most interesting about what <em>is</em> shown here is how defiantly generic it is when it comes to Superman-based media. Forgetting the shots of crowds looking agog that makes up the bulk of the footage, we’ve got a glimpse of a generic Daily Planet office (including Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane and Skyler Gisondo’s Jimmy Olsen), a split-picosecond moment of Superman flying through the ice inevitably surrounding his Fortress of Solitude, and a tiny dot of Superman disappearing up into the clouds. Each could be lifted from just about any adaptation of the character, from the early ‘90s <em>Lois &amp; Clark</em> to the grey slop of 2006’s <em>Superman Returns</em>—hell, we only know it’s not from 1948's <em>Superman </em>serial or 2013's <em>Man of Steel </em>because it’s in color.</p><figure id="" data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rotten Tomatoes Trailers / DC Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s also arguable that all of this is an act of boldness, a real statement from Gunn (although who knows how involved he is in the marketing), and that’s  backed up by two other factors: the title and the score.</p><p>Calling your movie <em>Superman</em>, with no subtitle, is a statement. There already was a <em>Superman</em>, in 1978, and Richard Donner’s version has never been improved upon in any of the six films across three relaunches since (let alone the character’s repeated flogging in Snyder’s DCU). It was originally to be called <em>Superman: Legacy</em>, and dropping the suffix is ballsy. Gunn invites direct comparison with the Christopher Reeve classic—a beautifully shot movie that holds up almost 50 years later.</p><p>Then there’s the theme. It’s right there, subtle at first, then—amid the obligatory bassy “thommmm”s that all superhero movie trailers must feature by law—out emerges a faint rendition of John Williams’ classic tune. Again, it’s an unflinching declaration that this film is operating at the same level and evoking the same tonal reverence as the classic that, arguably, both ushered in the era of the modern superhero film, and defined it.</p><p>Gunn’s a fun movie maker, and has had well-deserved success via funny, schlocky films like <em>Slither</em> and <em>Super</em>, followed by the cartoon-like jubilance and hilarity of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> trilogy and <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. I’m genuinely excited that he’s trying to make something un-terrible from DC properties, ending the era of Snyder’s well-intentioned but grimly dreary attempts, and he’s an obvious fit for the sillier, more subversive side of the comic franchise. But playing <em>Superman</em> this straight, this on-the-nose? I’m fascinated to see what comes of it. Even if I doubt tomorrow’s “teaser” will tell us anything useful.</p><p>My desperate hope is that this could be, finally, <em>finally</em>, the moment someone writes a <em>Superman </em>script that doesn’t depend on unSupermanning him in order to introduce any peril or plot. My “time to Kryptonite” stopwatch will be running, and god, I hope it never has to stop. It’s the great flaw of the great American hero, that the only way anyone can find for an invincible, all-powerful god-like to be interesting on film is to incessantly make him incapable and all-vulnerable, and rely on enemy hubris to save the day.</p><p>(Massive shout-out to CW’s recently finished <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, which despite featuring some hoary old cliches and a miserable over-reliance on all shades of Kryptonite, managed to make Clark Kent vulnerable in <em>far </em>more interesting ways, not least in its extraordinary third-season arc following Lois’s cancer story.)</p><p>So, are you hyped for the teaser trailer to hype the six months of trailer-trailers, to hype the movie, ahead of its July 11, 2025 release date? I really hope we’re not exhausted by its simple existence by then.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This included visiting actual arcades to understand exactly how it worked, since the game doesn't exist in any other, more accessible, capacity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito said the development team had been talking about bringing The Ocean Hunter over for a year ahead of actually beginning work, because it's lack of license-related complications made it an ideal choice and it also very much fits the theme of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">which arrives February 21</a>, is a spin-off sequel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, the eighth mainline entry in the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">or ninth including Yakuza 0</a>). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/majima-focused-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-at-rgg-summit-as-next-yakuza-game">It follows Majima</a> as he wakes up with amnesia and becomes a pirate, exploring the likes of Hawaii along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A trailer released at the October Xbox Partner Showcase revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-is-eating-assassins-creeds-lunch-in-new-trailer">a proper first look at ship combat akin to Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> and the return of the beloved character Taiga Saejima, perhaps teasing more ties to the main series than previously thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will also be a decent bit longer than previous Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-is-a-decent-bit-longer-than-previous-spin-off-like-a-dragon-gaiden">its story taking around 15 to 18 hours to complete</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-killzone-crossover-has-already-sparked-an-outcry-over-the-super-high-cost-of-items<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-killzone-crossover-is-real-and-its-out-now">Helldivers 2’s Killzone crossover</a>, confirmed and released today, December 18, has already sparked a backlash over the cost of its items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part one of the Helldivers 2 and Killzone crossover includes a Killzone-themed armor set, assault rifle, banner, cape, and player title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid excitement that Sony has remembered the Killzone franchise exists over a decade since the launch of the last game in Guerrilla’s first-person shooter series are complaints about the cost of these items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new armor costs 500 Super Credits, the new cape 310 Super Credits, the new helmet 310 Super Credits, and, most egregious of all, the new assault rifle costs 615 Super Credits. Oh, and all these items are only available for five days before they’re rotated out of the store.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth putting these prices into context. 1,000 SC costs $9.99 / £7.99 in the in-game store. One of Helldivers 2’s premium Warbonds costs 1,000 Super Credits, which means that if you want all the Killzone items, you’re looking at just shy of twice the price of a premium Warbond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, there will be Helldivers 2 players who have Super Credits saved up after nearly a year of playing the game, and it’s worth noting that you can unlock 300 Super Credits in Warbonds with your medals, or find them out and about by looting in gameplay. But the fact remains that these items are also being sold for real-world money, and the pricing is unlike anything fans have seen so far in Helldivers 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Killzone assault rifle has sparked renewed pay-to-win accusations from some in the game’s community, despite it being considered a bit of a downgrade compared to already available guns. The Helldivers subreddit is already littered with complaints, many of which point out that Helldivers 2 is not a free game and so should take a different approach to monetization.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/hd-1734537347269.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Some Helldivers 2 players say the Killzone items are too expensive. Image credit: SIE.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Straight-Break-4169 said</a>: “No set should cost over 1,000 SC. Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR?? They seriously add a new gun and lock it behind a 600 Super Credit paywall!?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added Goopmaster_</a>. “I get the game needs to be monetized in some way, I get that the devs’ work isn’t free, but charging half a Warbond price for an assault rifle with no optic is straight up nonsense.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I knew it was a slippery slope, but didn't think we'd reach that part of the slope already,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/comment/m2n69yx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SovietMarma commented</a>. “I've willingly paid for 1,000 SC packs for each and every Warbond release so I could support the game and buy the Super Store armors that came with them. Don't think I'll be doing the same here.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Arrowhead said the Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 belongs to a new tier of “special” premium content reserved for collaborations and other “uniquely-themed work.” “Our plan is to offer you something distinct and special,” the developer added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">Helldivers 2’s recent Illuminate update</a> breathed new life into the game, sparking a resurgence in players and enthusiasm around the addition of a new faction to fight against. But as has been the case multiple times during the game’s rollercoaster first year of live service, it’s a case of one step forward, two steps back for community sentiment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as you'd expect, fans are taking to Steam user reviews to express their dissatisfaction over the Killzone prices. "The Superstore items are straight scams," one negative review reads. "Such a shame after such a great update."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Ultizero Games has revealed a new gameplay trailer for Lost Soul Aside. It will launch for PS5 and PC in 2025, although no specific date was given yet. It's an action game that looks like it plays similar to a Devil May Cry game with the visuals of a Final Fantasy game.</p><p>The trailer shows the main character, Kazer, in a snowy tundra setting fighting some big opponents, including some sort of ice monster and ice wolf. The gameplay features frenetic action and chaining together combos to pull off flashy attacks. It also looks like players will have a companion, as a woman is seen joining the heat of battle.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lost Soul Aside – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Not much is known about the story, but according to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, Kazer is off to save his sister as well as humankind from an invading dimensional threat.</p><p>Lost Soul Aside is part of PlayStation's China Hero Project, which focuses on publishing games made by Chinese developers to an international audience. Other examples include FIST: Forged in Shadow Torch and Anno: Mutationem.</p><p>Lost Soul Aside was inspired by Final Fantasy XV. Independent developer Yang Bin shared a prototype of the game in 2016, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lost-soul-aside-will-launch-on-ps5-debuts-new-gameplay-trailer/1100-6490929/" data-ref-id="1100-6490929">captured the attention of Sony</a> and allowed him to establish Ultizero Games.</p>

Some movies simply use Christmas as a sort of emotional backdrop for their naughty deeds. Meanwhile, other movies use the holiday as a narrative device meant to highlight a character’s road to redemption and triumph with a feeling of togetherness familiar to all. It’s easy to tell what’s a Christmas movie. It’s not so easy to tell which ones are naughty and which ones are nice.</p><p>A movie overflowing with cursing like <em>Friday After Next </em>is actually a nicer Christmas movie than the family-centric <em>Home Alone</em> because the former uses the feeling of Christmas goodness to overcome its vulgar obstacles while the latter is entirely about an innocent kid surviving a life-or-death situation. One film’s core is a quest to engineer a Christmas miracle to save characters from homelessness, and the other film is just a home invasion comedy thriller set during Christmas. </p><p>All of this and more will be explained once you dive into our examples of some of the best naughty and nice Christmas movies.</p></div></div><div><p><em>Die Hard </em>may very well be a wholesome Christmas movie, given its story about a man wanting to patch things up with his estranged wife. (At least that’s how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919">screenwriter Jeb Stuart</a></span> argues on its behalf.) But that doesn’t excuse the fact that John McClane racks up a body count of <em>ten</em> men by the time the end credits roll. Sure, they’re all international criminals posing as terrorists who would have killed far more without McClane to stop them. But if Snoopy and the Red Baron could set aside bloodshed on Christmas night, surely John and Hans could have done so too.</p></div><div><p>Disregarding the 3D-ness of it all, <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> goes down smoother than fast food sliders ever could. John Cho, Kal Penn, and Neil Patrick Harris reunite for one more, seemingly final round as the estranged best friends rediscover their bond after taking their first steps into real adulthood. See past the R-rated vulgarity, gun violence, and claymation dongs and you’ll find <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> to be the gift that keeps on giving.</p></div><div><p><em>Home Alone </em>doesn’t have nearly enough holiday cheer, nor its young star quite enough charm, to cover up the film’s child abandonment resulting from a faulty alarm clock. John Hughes’ seminal film may be a Christmas classic, but that doesn’t mean it’ll ever get off the naughty list. For children, Christmas is a time for the joyful innocence of awaiting Santa Claus’s arrival to  reward your good year with great presents, as you maybe leave him some milk and cookies to sweeten the deal. It’s not about a kid fighting for his life by leaving nails for thief Marv (Daniel Stern) to step on, and a scolding hot doorknob for Harry (Joe Pesci) to burn his hand on, as both try to rob the child’s home. Sorry to say, but one of the greatest Christmas movies ever is also one of the naughtiest.</p></div><div><p>Everything about <em>Elf</em> is a Christmas miracle. Springing from the mind of screenwriter David Berenbaum and executed by the dynamo duo of Jon Favreau and Will Ferrell—the latter considered a liability among executives at the time, given his previous starring role in the bawdy <em>Old School</em>—<em>Elf</em> defied expectations to become the premier holiday classic of the new millennium. Its spellbinding sense of unabashed joy and its story concerning one man’s search for family are powerful enough to thaw even the iciest hearts. And few can resist the simple hilarity of six-foot-three Will Ferrell in emerald stockings.</p></div><div><p>Never judge a book by its cover, but always judge a Christmas movie by its Santa. Billy Bob Thornton, as Willie T. Soke, portrays arguably the crudest department store Santa Claus in history. Telling a child on your lap that you contracted a disease from sleeping with Mrs. Claus’s sister and then showing up to work drunk is sacrilegious to anyone who celebrates Christmas. The movie takes an exceptionally dark turn when Willie attempts suicide—something no Christmas story should have to endure. While preteen Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) ultimately gains the gift of lasting friendship with Willie and the confidence to stand up to his bullies, it only comes after Willie is shot by the police while wearing his Santa costume and Thurman flips off his harasser. You can’t slap a few ornaments on a lump of coal and call it anything but naughty.</p></div><div><p>I know what you’re about to say, and you’re correct: <em>Friday After Next</em> had more F-words that weren’t “frolicking” or “family” in it than any Christmas movie should have. But it was all in service of preserving what makes Christmas great. Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Daymond “Day-Day” Jones (Mike Epps) make ridiculous attempts at paying rent after a thief dressed as Santa Claus robs them of their rent money and gifts. That, along with Katt Williams’ Money Mike character thwarting sexual assault by clinching Damon “Triple O.G.” Pearly’s (Terry Crews’) testicles with pliers, is antithetical to the Christmas spirit. However, gathering people for a Christmas Eve party to help them pay their rent, along with Christmas carolers getting retribution for those who harassed them while they spread holiday cheer, are beautiful examples of the power of Christmas. Plus, catching the robber in the ’hood, getting the money back, and leaving him on a roof for the cops to collect is nothing short of a Christmas miracle.</p></div><div><p>Nothing is more awkward than your boss hooking up with your crush. So imagine being Jack Lemmon in Billy Wilder’s <em>The Apartment</em>, whose boss isn’t just sleeping with his crush (Shirley MacLaine) but doing the deed in his own pad! (Even worse: Imagine the cleaning bill on all of his own bedsheets.) Beloved as it may be with its sweet happy ending and the triumph of personal happiness over professional ambition, the central predicament of <em>The Apartment</em> is just about the epitome of the holiday blues. The very kind Elvis sang about. </p></div><div><p>No, revealing someone’s sex work past and a cancer death aren’t really what Christmas is all about. Those are just the lowlights, however, in an illuminating Christmas classic, <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>. The sequel to 1999's <em>The Best Man</em> finds a fractured yet still familial group of friends spending the holidays together when infidelity, financial mismanagement, and betrayal strike. The performances from the film’s incredible ensemble, which includes Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Terrence Howard, and Regina Hall, are all rooted in the type of redeemable honesty that inspires the forgiveness that Christmas calls for. Coordinated displays of love, like wearing the same ugly Santa sweater as your partner and going Christmas caroling, are quintessentially in the Christmas spirit. Thanks to <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>, you can add four men doing a choreographed rendition of New Edition’s “Can You Stand the Rain” for the women in their lives (while decked in enough leather to cause a heat stroke in slightly hotter conditions) to that list.</p></div><div><p>Hot chocolate and pecan pie can set the Christmas mood perfectly—unless they’re consumed under duress while your kidnappers are seconds away from pummeling you. Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, and <em>Forrest Gump</em>’s Gary Sinise, <em>Reindeer Games</em> follows ex-con Rudy Duncan (Affleck) as he assumes the identity of his late cellmate Nick (James Frain) to win over a woman named Ashley (Theron) and spend time with her family for Christmas after being released from prison. However, he soon finds himself entangled in a dangerous plot led by Ashley’s brother Gabriel (Sinise), who believes Rudy (posing as Nick) can help them rob a casino. Kidnapping, excessive blood and guns, and a deadly finale are all cardinal sins of Christmas movies, banishing this one to the naughty pile.</p></div><div><p>Paul Giamatti may be a perpetual Grinch in his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w">Golden Globe Award</a></span>-winning performance as boarding school <strike>dictator</strike> teacher Paul Hunham in <em>The Holdovers</em>, but that just makes the Christmas joy he helps engineer all the more sacred and earned. No one should be alone on Christmas, and <em>The Holdovers </em>immaculately demonstrates that as Hunham, petulant student Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), and grieving cafeteria manager Mary Lamb (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) are all stuck at Barton Academy boarding school over the holidays, life passing each of them by in particular ways. They band together and help each other reconnect with family and the joy of life. That’s as Christmas as it’s going to get.</p></div><div><p>As is the case anytime Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg collaborate on something, there is a heart of gold beneath the crude surface of <em>The Night Before</em>. But that still doesn’t mean it gets on Santa’s nice list. While this wildly underrated Christmas comedy champions the endurance of male friendships and taking personal accountability, there’s still a whole lotta lies, drugs, and unprotected sex in dive bar bathrooms during this oh-so-holy night. Also, while things ultimately work out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lizzy Caplan, it’s never a good idea to spring a public marriage proposal on your ex.</p></div><div><p>“Isn’t there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?” cries Charlie Brown. “Sure Charlie Brown, I can tell you what Christmas is all about,” a calm Linus says before cueing the stagelights and recounting the story of the First Christmas. It’s an iconic emotional climax to an equally iconic Christmas movie, one that stands the test of time thanks to just how much poor old Charlie Brown buckles under the weight of expectations and hollow artificiality. Linus’ Bible lecture isn’t religious dogma, not really. Just a calm reminder that the real intentions of these end-of-year celebrations are, as he puts it, “peace [and] good will toward men.”</p><h2 id="h163289"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been claimed by Maksym Krippa, the owner of GSC Game World, that discussions are underway with Netflix regarding a TV adaptation of STALKER, the survival-based FPS franchise. Last month, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released to a mixed reception, but it was recently revealed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-profitable-one-month-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already become profitable at GSC</a>.</p>



<p>Within just two days, Heart of Chornobyl had sold a million copies, despite being listed on day one on both PC and Xbox Game Pass. It would be the latest in a long line of games to get the television adaptation treatment, following in the footsteps of shows like The Last of Us and Fallout.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-never-say-never">Never Say Never</h2>



<p>Maksym Krippa, the enigmatic multi-millionaire owner of GSC Game World – and other entities like Natus Vincere – has admitted that the company is looking at a TV adaptation of STALKER with Netflix. In an interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes Ukraine</a>, the entrepreneur explained that he’d ‘love to see’ STALKER appear on screen through an alternate medium.</p>



<p>While nothing has been finalised, it likely wouldn’t take much for Netflix to hop on board with the idea.</p>



<p>In recent months and years, shows like Riot Games’ Arcane, Amazon’s Fallout, and HBO’s The Last of Us have skyrocketed up the charts, pulling in millions of viewers. With how successful STALKER 2 has been since dropping last month, it stands to reason that a well-made show set in the lore-rich universe of the game could do quite well.</p>



<p>Do you think a STALKER adaptation would work well on television? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It was an unusual prediction, as immersive sims rely on a game being able to account for a wide buffet of player choices in a game world. Adding more players to such an open environment in a game like OtherSide's in-development project </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3341000/Thick_As_Thieves/">Thick as Thieves</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be seen as risky.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time he said it had a lot to do with tabletop-style interactivity, where players work together to create a dynamic story, pushing and pulling at the world around them. He and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Greg Piccolo (also OtherSide vice president of product) were jubilant about diving into "thief-versus-thief" game design—but they couldn't share very much about what they were working on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now fresh off a reveal at The Game Awards, the pair, joined by lead designer David McDonough, could offer a bigger peek behind the curtain. They were eager to share the nuts-and-bolts of how they're tackling the challenges of online "immersive sims"—all to satisfy players that they say "want to feel clever" while playing against each other.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Thick as Thieves"><span>Thick as Thieves</span>' "shared quest" system drives its dynamism</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/warren-spector-says-the-next-logical-step-for-immersive-sims-is-multiplayer" target="_self">Warren Spector says the next logical step for immersive sims is multiplayer</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Piccolo explained in our chat that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' most exciting game mechanic had finally come together in the last few months: a centralizing objective system called a "shared quest." In earlier versions of the game, players competed to steal multiple items in round-based gameplay. Those multiple items are still there, but now one shared objective that all players are hunting for binds the experience together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The structure echoes that of the "extraction shooter" genre, where players enter a map to battle NPCs—and each other—to get out with the biggest prize possible. What makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> different, Spector said, is that it's a game about "competition, not defeating your opponents."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You're not trying to necessarily beat up on the other the other players," he said (noting that still may be a viable solution for some eager to ambush their foes). Using the lens of "competition" as a design pillar helped the team tackle the friction between stealth-friendly immersive sims and multiplayer games. Stealth games, he said, are usually games where players try </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to interact with the environment or other characters. PvP games are all about interacting.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4z9nK5Tj4Rw" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're wondering why the idea of one major shared objective didn't surface sooner in development, it's because the production </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wasn't so much about planning one high-stakes heist, but exploring avenues for keeping repeatable session-based multiplayer as refreshing as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Piccolo said the Shared Quest system was a possible solution that OtherSide "knew about," but was really "brought into sharper focus" as work progressed on something called the "clue system."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The clue system is a randomized recreation of a beloved feature from immersive sim games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dishonored</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deathloop</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, etc. It's the means by which OtherSide scatters crumbs of knowledge throughout the game world that guide players to their target treasure. In a hands-off gameplay demo, the group explained these clues would change with every session so that players can't just memorize the best or most reliable routes and locations. The video showed an OtherSide playtester scurrying through the sewers and happening on a notebook that boldly displayed the words "THE VAULT CODE IS..." followed by a number that unfortunately has scuttled out of this writer's notes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Immersive sims have toyed with this tech for a while, using random number generators to prevent players from skipping key bits of content by memorizing passwords (or, sometimes, they've kept the numbers the same to reward players who retain knowledge of the level). This system takes the concept up another notch, as Piccolo explained that clue in the sewer probably won't be there every time players visit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The clue system also acts as a kind of balancing tool to lower the gap between experienced and newer players. It's one of many features in place to disincentivize players from brute-forcing the shared quest based on experience. "Knowledge is an accelerator for your progress," Piccolo said, and confining the relevant knowledge to each run of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reduces what friction players can eliminate by practicing run after run or watching YouTube videos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Piccolo said there's one fascinating challenge with the clue system that OtherSide is still working on. The clue in the notebook could be uncharitably described as "thuddingly obvious." It doesn't bury the passcode in with some in-game journal entry where a superior yells at a guard for not changing the vault code. "Lengthy exposition in a context where people are battling each other to get to a finish line was not welcome," Piccolo observed, saying the version shown to press was a perfect example of developers getting a feature functional, then figuring out how to make it flavorful.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game design is the real immersive sim">Game design is the real immersive sim</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prodding the OtherSide team about how the Shared Quest system could seem like an obvious feature seemed a bit unfair. But to students or industry newcomers it's a fair question: how is it that core gameplay loop came so much later in production?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spector stood up to the plate here, ready to knock down the idea that the mechanic could have been ready to implement on day one. "Documentation is stale the instant the the virtual ink dries on the virtual page," he said. "It doesn't matter how much you think about something or how clever and creative you are, you're not going to think of everything, especially in this kind of game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fascinating that Spector warned designers against overestimating their own cleverness while showing off a game meant to help players feel clever—but maybe that's a key ingredient to making immersive sims. There can be cleverness in solving elaborate puzzles with fixed solutions, but the genre has built such a passionate cult fanbase because players grapple on to the unexpected and boundary-pushing solutions to problems ranging from breaking-and-entering to long-distance assassination.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating systems, letting players push the boundaries with them (or fail to do so, even if you know they can), is a design process that doesn't mesh with immediately borrowing the core gameplay loops of popular titles. It's risky and can burn far more development time. But if OtherSide's bet pays off, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will absolutely be a one-of-a-kind game that attracts players who thrill at stumbling into feeling like a genius—only to be one-upped by another player that stumbled into an equally brain-bending solution.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-simpsons-christmas-disney-plus-derren-brown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since Disney owns <em>The Simpsons</em>, there are sometimes episodes that are only on Disney+. Despite <em>The Simpsons</em> being one of the shows I regularly play in the background while I’m doing other things, I’ve never watched any of these until yesterday, when a Christmas episode featured UK mentalist Derren Brown.</p><p>Brown is, to my understanding, very well-known in the UK, but not so much here in America. I came across his work all the way back in 2012, when I was writing a play about–stay with me here–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(movement)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritualism</a> after the Civil War for a <a href="https://www.hughryan.org/pop-up-museum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">queer history arts festival</a>. As part of that, I was doing a ton of research about how seances, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-real-fakery-of-the-ouija-board-1819805308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spirit writing</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj177SqjydA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">table turning</a> were actually performed, reading lots of old books by debunkers of the movement (including, fun fact, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66451/66451-h/66451-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Houdini</a>). This led me to Brown, who in addition to debunking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEYW2vqqNDQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faith healers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acnUkYNTk90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mediums</a>, has also performed versions of some spiritualist tricks, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjJhnz_Drls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billet reading</a>, as part of his stage shows. I was delighted by his stage work and devoured what I could find on YouTube (most of it, alas, seems to have been scrubbed now). I’m less of a fan of his TV specials, where he’s done things like convince someone they’ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfo_HJ8TRpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emergency landed a plane</a>, played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQWK0zBhNz8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian roulette</a>, or otherwise performed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpUpNv9uNSI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat manipulative stunts</a> that have always felt a little too “TV magician” to really resonate with me.</p><p>I interviewed Brown in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210617095830/https://www.jezebel.com/mentalist-derren-brown-makes-magic-from-the-stories-we-1796235264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017</a> for Jezebel, when he brought his stage show <em>Secret</em> to the US. If I recall right I found some roundabout way of bringing up our shared interest in spiritualism but maintained the professional boundaries necessary to not devolve the whole interview into talking about it. Since then, I’ve a little bit lost track of his work, though it’s always stayed with me as a gateway into a fascination with stage magic.&nbsp;</p><p>So that was a long-winded way of saying I was surprised and excited to see him headline a 45-minute <em>Simpsons</em> episode, “O C’mon All Ye Faithful.” The episode is structured around his TV stunts, where he attempts to manipulate Springfield into the Christmas spirit through his brand of tricks. The second half of the episode centers on Flanders’ religious faith as a result of Brown’s actions, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_The_Simpsons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topic</a> I’m always excited for <em>The Simpsons</em> to explore. The episode does a good job of explaining who Brown is to an audience I can’t imagine is familiar without over-explaining, and while the whole thing feels like a cameo geared toward a very narrow audience who’s excited about both Brown and how religion is portrayed in media (namely, me), it’s a pretty OK episode. I was moved, but also a little let down, by its climax, where I personally feel it fumbles the bag on <em>why</em> people are religious, but this response is also very me. I was charmed by how much Brown sounds like himself, with all his familiar-to-me patter and some of his personal stances regarding psychology and religion.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have Disney+ you should totally watch the episode, but this blog is mostly an excuse to tell you how glad I am that Brown’s work introduced me to stage magic beyond the cultural presence of David Copperfield and the worst parts of Penn &amp; Teller (as opposed to the best parts, like how <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1302071519015841794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful</a> I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0mL3PWKkwU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their version of the Miser’s Dream</a> is on <em>Fool Us</em>). I have become in particular a huge fan of card tricks, which I maintain are our <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1805262239533838845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most human</a> narrative art form: they work because of how our brain works and how it intersects with our culture, how we are hard-wired toward meaning and connection; a card trick happens in the performer’s hands but also by drawing on the very foundations of how we live in the world. The big thing with stage magic seems to be not knowing how it’s done, but I’ve never found this true for myself. I found magicians pretty offputting, the way I think many people do (they often don’t do themselves any favors), until I learned more about how their effects are achieved, when I was able to see precisely how complicated and beautiful and deeply human even the simplest-seeming trick is. I am hardly an expert (unlike my old G/O coworker <a href="https://www.avclub.com/why-i-m-still-obsessed-with-magic-tricks-1798265096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Pang</a>, whom I would constantly DM about either magic or food writing), but the more I’ve learned about how effects are done, the more in awe I am of a field I think a lot of adults write off. I’ve been excited to see the growing popularity of more “mature” stage shows, like Derek DelGaudio’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_62BeXxd_jo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>In &amp; Of Itself</em></a> (which I will admit I saw live and thought was just OK but liked more when I saw it again on Hulu; both times, I thought the best effect by far was the very last one).</p><p>I woke up this morning feeling overwhelmed, in dread of the tasks of the day before I’d even opened my eyes. But now, a few hours later, I’m thinking about how the same thought patterns I apply to spreadsheets and to-do lists to keep a business running can be applied to cards and coins and envelopes to expose how beautiful and miraculous it is to walk around with a human brain, how our instinct for meaning-making can be used to both maintain our day-to-day and break out of it. For about as long as I’ve been aware of Brown’s work I’ve been carting around a used copy of the seminal <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-royal-road-to-card-magic-hey-presto-magic-book-jean-hugard/21556637?ean=9781909678255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Royal Road to Card Magic</em></a>, with the dream of learning to do a single card trick before I die, just to know for myself how it feels to make something so lovely out of so little. That dream gets less and less likely every year (Do you know how to do this? Help me out!), but sharing my enthusiasm for it with you has reminded me that there’s still time. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix"><h3>Squid Game: Unleashed, Like Other Squid Game Spinoffs, Misses The Point</h3></a><p>Netflix's mobile game highlights how weird it is to turn Squid Game into IP</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Depending on your playstyle and the build you’re after, you might need an early-game skill to clear standard mobs, but you’ll quickly realize that many of the Mercenary’s abilities prove potent well into the late-game, too. For now, let’s focus on three must-have skills.</p><p><strong>Tier I: Explosive Grenade</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most powerful early-game skills you can unlock for the Mercenary, specifically an AoE (area-of-effect) ability that deals Physical and Fire Damage to mobs, is the <strong>Explosive Grenade</strong>. It’s an effective party starter of a skill, as tossing one into a small group will whittle down an enemy’s health and soften them up.

<p>It has been claimed by GSC Game World’s mysterious owner, Maksym Krippa, that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is already profitable a mere month after being released worldwide. In a rare interview with Forbes Ukraine, the multi-millionaire entrepreneur said that GSC has ‘already sold enough to make the project profitable.’</p>



<p>He also mentioned that discussions are underway regarding a live-action adaptation of the series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-quick-turnaround">Quick Turnaround</h2>



<p>Maksym Krippa is a relatively unknown individual, working in the shadows and pumping tens of millions of dollars into projects under the brands and companies that he owns. In his interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes Ukraine</a>, he revealed that he has invested <strong>a lot </strong>into the development of STALKER 2, but he wouldn’t part ways with an exact sum:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Of course, it’s tens of millions of dollars.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Krippa is no stranger to the wider games industry. In 2022, he acquired Natus Vincere, Ukraine’s most prominent esports organisation and a world-class competitor in the Counter-Strike market, amongst other games.</p>



<p>STALKER 2’s success comes as no surprise. It was in development, on and off, for more than a decade, and it garnered some solid reviews when it finally hit the market. It was a divisive game, though. Many players had more than their fair share of issues with the game, but GSC Game World has worked incessantly to patch up the mutant-ridden shooter.</p>



<p>It was just two days after launch that STALKER 2 was revealed to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-1-million-copies/">sold one million copies</a> – despite the game being available on both Xbox and PC Game Pass. That was enough to set the tone for the game, which has continued to evolve and retain the attention of a worldwide audience ever since.</p>

<p>Back in the mid-to-late 2000s, developer Free Radical Design was working on the third installment of the popular Star Wars Battlefront series for the Nintendo Wii. In 2008, however, Star Wars Battlefront 3 was ultimately cancelled for a variety of he said, she said reasons. Now, 16 years later, Star Wars Battlefront 3 gameplay has leaked online for players to see for themselves.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNLILrbrO58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a>, the build was found via the Free Radical Archive. According to them, it comes from a build dated roughly a week before the game’s cancellation.</p>



<p>“This build, made in the final week of development, is full of content that has not been seen before by fans,” they said. “As this game was cancelled during development, there are still bugs and issues which we hope can be resolved through future modding.”</p>



<p>The video below shows both gameplay as well as a recreation of the game’s PC trailer using the Wii build.</p>

<p>First uncovered in 2006, Star Wars Battlefront 3 was the third game in the popular early-2000s series. The game was in development for at least two years before it was cancelled in late 2008. The reasons for the cancellation are unconfirmed, but there have been claims.  Free Radical Design co-founder Steve Ellis believes it was, in part, due to the fact that LucasArts didn’t want to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120512004359/http://www.joystiq.com/2012/04/27/this-is-what-happened-to-star-wars-battlefront-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“spend big”</a> on the game’s marketing. On the other side of things, an unnamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-lucasarts-employee-on-why-star-wars-battlefront-iii-failed/1100-6400936/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LucasArts employee claimed</a> the developers had regularly missed deadlines, burning goodwill with the publisher.</p>

			<p>Last month, Wccftech was invited to join a small and exclusive number of outlets for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lead-architect-mark-cerny-unveils-codename-amethyst-ml-collaboration-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive presentation</a> hosted by PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny. While the main topic was, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new console</a>, there was even an exciting announcement regarding a collaboration with AMD on a machine learning project called 'Codename Amethyst.'</p>
<p>Following the presentation, we had a one-on-one chat with the legendary programmer and game designer (in case you didn't know, he worked on the first Crash Bandicoot and Spyro installments, as well as the Jak &amp; Daxter franchise and, more recently, directed Knack and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/knack-2-demo-available-european-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>). Since this event took place ahead of the launch of the PlayStation 5 Pro, some of the topics discussed may have been revealed and/or confirmed by the publication of this article.</p>
<p>However, we also asked him a lot of future-facing questions, such as if PSSR would get a frame generation component, whether variable refresh rate on the console would be updated to support Low Framerate Compensation, and we also inquired about the feasibility of path tracing on PS5 Pro, among other things. Keep scrolling for the full transcription of our interview with Sony Interactive Entertainment's Mark Cerny.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PSSR-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>The main focus of your presentation was arguably PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), so let's kick off with that. You previously commented on when the PlayStation 5 Pro project started internally, but when did you begin working on PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>We started on PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution at roughly the same time as we started on the hardware itself. Though, the neural network we are using today is something that we came up with, I believe, in late 2021.</p>
<p><strong>How has the development of the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware evolved over the past few years in tandem with PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>The hardware definitely came first, because you can't know that your neural network is implementable unless you understand a bit about the hardware that it's going to be running on top of. So, simply put, in 2020 we did early hardware work. In 2021, we did more detailed hardware work and fully kicked off the PSSR project.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see PSSR evolving after the launch of the console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>We're definitely going to continue our work in this space. There are so many ways that we can take that, though, right? We could continue to improve PSSR or start working on some of the other targets that I mentioned, like frame generation, frame extrapolation, ray tracing, denoising, and the like. I think it'll be interesting to see over the next few months what the full reaction from the development community is.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to maybe add a frame generation component to PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, at the current moment, our focus is definitely on Super Resolution. I'm just saying that there are a number of other very attractive targets out there.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about Super Resolution, does it require per-game training as the first version of NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling, or is it more of a general model like DLSS 2.0 and later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's generalized training.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about roughly how long it takes to implement PSSR compared to NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, or Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's almost a drop-in replacement for the other strategies. The difficulty is that game engines tend to evolve along with the Super Resolution or the upscaling strategy that they're using. So, if you're trying to add something in after the fact that the game was not developed with, then there's a bit of rejiggering of the game engine that may be needed. Much of the time I think the developers spent bringing it over was the logistics of where in their pipeline they're going to insert PSSR.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sony-PlayStation-5-Pro-_-AMD-SoC-_7.png"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Moving on from PSSR to the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware, the new SSD's size has obviously been greatly increased from the 768 GB of the PlayStation 5. Did the SSD's speed&nbsp;also improve in the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>No, the speed of the SSD on PS5 Pro is the same as the speed of the SSD on PS5.</p>
<p><strong>OK. Did Sony ever consider expanding the RAM during the development of the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, definitely more RAM is needed to implement those new features because PSSR needs a bit of RAM, and the ray tracing implementation definitely needs RAM. The question was just how much RAM is needed. We worked out that probably a gigabyte or so would be enough to support the big three that I was talking about.</p>
<p>We have GDDR 6, which is very fast memory—16 gigabytes of it. Then we added slow DDR5 RAM and started moving over to that from the fast RAM. That frees up fast RAM for the games, and that's the one or so GB I was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>I know that during Remote Play, the PlayStation 5 disables some of the video capture capabilities. Are those enabled on the PlayStation 5 Pro, or does it have the same limitations in this regard?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>The same limitations. There are many features that the gamer can use that require&nbsp;memory, and not all of them can be used simultaneously simply because there isn't enough memory on the system side. We want to get the bulk of the memory to the games, and the limitation set is the same on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Will Sony add Low Framerate Compensation or LFC to improve the Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience on PS5 and PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>There are ongoing discussions about where we should be taking VRR, and that's definitely part of those discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Another major advancement of the PlayStation 5 Pro is in the ray tracing capability. Will that enable the console to run full path tracing, like we see on PC with games like Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>One difficulty in answering your question is that there are so many strategies for doing ray tracing or path tracing. Just to give an example, the engine that drives Alan Wake 2 is very, very different from the engine that drives Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>There were talks on both of these at the Game Developers Conference that I went to. I really hesitate to say that PlayStation 5 Pro can or can't do path tracing, but you need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Some PS5 Pro titles have implemented AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution Frame Generation. Have there been any complications with that running in tandem with PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>No, PSSR is Super Resolution, so whatever strategy a game has for frame generation should be completely orthogonal.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. This is something I was curious about. At the launch of PS5, there were some PlayStation 4 titles like Bloodborne and The Last Guardian that, throughout their life cycle, were patched to have a locked 30 frames per second mode. If you go back to the 1.0 version of the disk, they also feature an unlocked frame rate. Has Sony been in conversations to kind of revisit that to unlock those frame rates on the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>I'm afraid I can't say anything about Bloodborne or that other title that you mentioned on PS5 Pro. Typically, the games on PS5 Pro are running in what we're calling Boost Mode. In this mode, we do give the game the entire GPU and faster memory to use, but whatever limitations it had are still there on the PS5 Pro version. So there's things that are definitely going to get better and things that will stay the same. I will say if your game has VRR, you should see substantially higher frame rates on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Will the PlayStation 5 Pro substantially boost PlayStation VR 2 games compared to the original console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>PS VR 2 titles are definitely being boosted on PS5 Pro. There's a couple of different rendering strategies that VR titles take, depending on the strategy. PSSR is either something that works out of the box or something that needs a little bit more care and handling to be functional, and I think right now, we're at the point where we're getting pretty good uptake across the portfolio on PS VR2 for PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Forgive me if you have mentioned this before - is PSSR going to be a toggle in the system settings for players who may want to play the title as it was originally developed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's all whatever the developer would like to do. It's what they feel is best for their game. Some of the developers, like Naughty Dog, are offering the PS5 modes on PS5 Pro, so you can pick Performance Pro or you can pick the original Performance or Fidelity modes, but other developers decided that what is best is that you would have strictly Pro modes when playing their game on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

<p><strong>The big surprise of today's presentation was the Amethyst machine learning project with AMD. What are the first steps of that collaboration going to look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, we've already started talking. Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>One thing you touched on during the presentation was the democratization and standard libraries between SIE and AMD, which would be developed in&nbsp;parallel. Can you talk about how that partnership is going to be built out?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Certainly. Well, for hardware first, really this is not about PlayStation proprietary hardware. We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud.</p>
<p>For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Another keyword from the presentation was discovering the holy grail of graphics through fully fused neural networks. What does that look like in your mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Ultimately, what you would see is really high quality libraries based on CNN's (convolutional neural networks) for game graphics. To me, that's a bit of a prerequisite. You need to have hardware that is capable of doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Game developers are using so many different engines to say the least, between Decima, Unreal, Frostbite, and many more. How does machine learning tie those together? Is there kind of a unified path for the architecture here, whether it's PSSR or the other features on the PS5 Pro, to kind of mold itself to the requirements of those different engines?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>I think we look out there globally, NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR are doing a pretty good job supporting a broad variety of game engines. So, yes, I believe that with sufficient care taken in meeting the needs of the individual game developers, it's definitely possible to create these broadly usable libraries,</p>
<p><strong>So much of the focus has been obviously on the graphics and the visual aspect of the new PS5 Pro console. Does it also feature any additional capabilities for the audio component or anything else in the hardware, though?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Largely, the key improvements on the PS5 Pro are those big three. There are a few smaller features. The audio clock is a bit higher in case anybody wanted to use that. They can do a few more convolution reverbs; that is in there. Probably more significantly, you can run the CPU at a 10% higher frequency if you want to do so. By and large, though, the focus was on the big three key improvements.</p>
<p><strong>To wrap up our chat, is there one title that you feel is the standout centerpiece that shows players what the PS5 Pro can do at launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>There have been a number of pretty amazing titles on PlayStation 5 Pro, so I would really hate to pick one. I did personally enjoy seeing the eleven games we had at our hands-on event. On a personal note, that was really fun because I got to, in advance of that event, play and experience pretty much every game that was in development on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. As always, thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of the PS5 Pro</a> last month, Sony invited Wccftech as part of a very select number of media outlets and analysts to get an early look at the console and a soon-to-be-released deep dive into the system architecture by none other than the Lead Architect of the console, Mark Cerny. The event also included an exclusive Q&amp;A with Mr. Cerny himself afterward, which you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Cerny started off the presentation as a sort of ‘bits and bytes’ talk to principally focus on the GPU for the PlayStation 5 Pro and why it matters. As it’s been some seven years since the beginning of the PlayStation 5 journey, it’s been more than enough time for the technology advances to need that additional power to make the most of the console generation. With the PlayStation 5 already having been on the market for more than four years, Mark Cerny admitted that it’s taken time for game creators to get up to speed (unless you’re one of Sony’s first-party studios like Naughty Dog or Sony Santa Monica).</p>
<p>Much of the PS5 Pro presentation focused on what Mark Cerny called the Big Three: a larger GPU, advanced ray tracing features, and upscaling games through artificial intelligence and PlayStation Super Spectral Resolution, or PSSR.</p>
<p>The first focus was on the larger GPU present in the PlayStation 5 Pro which features a unique AMD architecture that Sony was branding as RDNA2.X. This was a hybrid variant of RDNA 2 while featuring both custom and future RDNA versions present in RDNA 3 and beyond. This is combined with a GPU that featured 66% more Work Group Processors, or WGP, compared to the graphics solution present in the existing PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony wanted to emphasize that they decided against fully upgrading the system architecture to RDNA 3 because they did not want to have two separate game packages or versions between the PlayStation 5's base and Pro models, not unlike Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and X solution.</p>
<p>Secondly, Sony made a point of refuting the 335 Teraflop number that was present in the lead-up to the PlayStation 5 Pro’s launch. Mark commented that it would have been a nice bonus to have twice the ‘flops,’ but it wouldn’t double the real-world performance and would have instead led to something he dubbed ‘Flopflation.’ He once again reiterated the increase from 18 WGPs (workgroup processors, or compute units) to 30 WGPs while also introducing 67% higher ‘flops’. In terms of real world gains, this meant upwards of a 45% improvement in performance.</p>
<p>One example given was how a frame taking 16 milliseconds to render on PlayStation 5 could instead be done in only 11 milliseconds on PlayStation 5 Pro, and those extra 5ms could instead be spent on adding ray tracing. These additional WGPs were primarily focused on ray calculations and the divergence associated. By improving the ease of use, Mark Cerny hoped that ray tracing would continue to be adopted at an increasing rate.</p>

<p>Lastly, Sony made a point to touch on the machine learning or AI present in the PlayStation 5 Pro architecture. By utilizing ML, it’s possible to give games a graphical boost by having a game render fewer pixels and then using the PSSR neural network to fill in the gaps. This was bookended with the intent that this would not necessarily result in rendering a smaller resolution to begin with. By way of extrapolation and frame generation, the possibility exists to have PSSR insert frames between key frames and reduce the choppiness that’s commonly seen in games running at a reduced frame rate. This type of adjusted rendering would not necessarily be the be-all, end-all in terms of graphical processing. Sure, the possibility exists for developers to use the neural processing units to initially render a title at 540P or 720P, but ultimately, it comes down to the matrix math as Cerny called it and integer operations at play, namely the TOPS, or Trillions of integer Operations per Second. These TOPS are the real numbers that Sony wanted to focus on for rendering efficiency and the actual bandwidth of the PS5 Pro hardware.</p>
<p>Sony ended their presentation on the PlayStation 5 Pro deep dive by talking about the future potential for what the next PlayStation could achieve and also a unique collaboration with AMD that they’re calling Codename Amethyst. While much of the machine learning architecture on the PlayStation 5 Pro pushes the hardware to its limits, there is still a bottleneck at play in terms of system memory access. This is an opportunity for growth and perhaps to achieve a fully fused network with PSSR and the overall potential for growth with machine learning as a whole. Through the PlayStation 5 Pro, Mark Cerny and his team have developed a good understanding of what the current system architecture is capable of and what is to come in a future console.</p>
<p>While details are somewhat scarce compared to the rest of the PlayStation 5 Pro deep dive, Amethyst is the culmination of a unique collaboration with AMD to create a democratized library for machine learning, built upon multiple generations of RDNA and Sony Interactive Entertainment’s research and development. Mark Cerny likened the potential of this collaboration to developing a sort of neural network focused on graphics for gaming.</p>
<p>This is where future hardware architectures for both machine learning and AI would be integrated and allow developers to use these resources and perhaps guide the technology into unanticipated directions. Sony made a key point that this collaboration would be developed in parallel between the two companies, with developers having the ability to draw from libraries. Rather than this being some matter of proprietary technology solely for Sony, Amethyst is intended to bring broad machine learning across a variety of devices. It's definitely an intriguing initiative, though it's unclear when we'll see it bearing fruit in actual games.</p>

Whether he’s torching his own birthday cake with a flamethrower or dancing with himself through a field of lasers, it’s never easy to shake the sense that the movie was more focused on achieving GIF-able moments than telling any kind of coherent story.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>In the end, Zilko’s assessment is that <em>Sonic 3</em> might be fun for young kids and diehard fans, but it can’t end soon enough for everyone else. He might be right. But as the perfect mark for a Sega nostalgia cash-in with Sonic-loving kids of his own, I’m ready to revel in the franchise brain rot no matter what. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
