            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-vs-switch-2-performance-which-version-should-you-buy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-switch-1-vs-switch-2-performance%E2%80%94which-version-should-you-buy.1318147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is getting the cross-generational treatment, releasing on both the Nintendo Switch 1 and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Sure, most people are going to focus on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s starters</a> or the new mega evolutions, but, as with many other Switch games, the performance is going to matter.</p>



<p>Here is a breakdown of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 performance differences in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and which version you should consider buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-and-switch-2">What’s Different in Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Switch 2 gives a smoother experience. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The difference in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions is purely based on performance. The Switch 2 version has a better framerate and resolution. Outside of that, both versions have the same content.</strong></p>



<p>On the original Switch, games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were criticized a lot for the performance issues both had. Luckily, the Switch 2 is more powerful, and that power allows Game Freak to get more out of their game with the new hardware.</p>







<p><strong>The version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A you should buy comes down to your situation</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, if you only own a Switch 1 and have not upgraded to a Switch 2, you should buy the Switch 1 version. However, it’s not a full guarantee that you should go with the upgraded version if you have the newer console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with many Switch 1 games, and this includes Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-pokemon-legends-z-a-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cost of the game</a> is $10 more expensive on the Switch 2 for that bump in performance. If you need to save money, you are fully capable of buying the Switch 1 version and then <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrading later in the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version does have the performance enhancements over the Switch 1, some people might not tell a drastic difference between the two. We are sure the difference is notable when shown side by side, but that isn’t as applicable when you only see one version.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you are a Switch 2 owner, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version</a> will give you the best performance. However, if you are in a spot where you need to save a little money, buying the Switch 1 version will still give you the full Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, with maybe a negligible performance difference when played on a Switch 2.</p>

Before a single line of dialogue hits viewers' ears, that song sets a tone, teases an emotional arc, and lets fans know whether a show is gonna punch them in the gut or kick their heart in its ass. Basically, a good OP is a part of an anime’s holy trinity: art style, voice cast, and theme song. When it slaps, you don’t skip it; you sing along with it week in and week out.&nbsp;</p><p>So when <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a>, the trashpunk shonen anime from Bones Film (of <em>My Hero Academia</em> fame), needed a new theme to match its explosive second cour, it wasn’t just about finding any fairweather musician to do the job. It needed someone who <em>gets it</em>. Someone who’s lived and breathed anime and knows what makes it work. Enter <a href="https://rollingstonejapan.com/articles/detail/38289/4/1/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mori Calliope</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | MAIN TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeRvDchyo44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mori Calliope isn’t just a megapopular VTuber with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_qhgtOy0dy1Agp8vkySQg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2 million subscribers</a> and a discography that goes hard—she’s also a diehard <em>Gachiakuta</em> manga fan who’s lowkey been fiending for this kind of opportunity. She’s a part of the crowd who liked it before its anime adaptation made it mainstream. Her upcoming <em>Gachiakuta </em>theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” aims to be a sonic embodiment of <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s volatile rage and righteous fury, mirroring Rudo’s descent into The Pit and his fight to reclaim justice.</p><p>In our chat, Mori Calliope broke down how “Let’s Just Crash” channels Rudo’s ongoing journey as the anime’s hero, how VTubbing let her cross the line from fan to creator, and how she hopes this collab will be the first of many to come as anime and VTubbing jointly become core tenets of pop culture.&nbsp;</p><h2>A VTuber manga reader fan’s dream come true</h2><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">！？！？！？so happy！！！！</p>— 裏那圭◾️KEI URANA (@KEI_URANA) <a href="https://twitter.com/KEI_URANA/status/1941380304159244710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> How did you first get involved with singing <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour theme—was it something you were approached to do, or was it something you wished to pursue as a fan of either Studio Bones' anime adaptation or Kei Urana’s ongoing manga?</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Mori Calliope:</strong> Honestly, it was a combination of both. I’ve been a fan of <em>Gachiakuta </em>since 2022. It was always in my heart—<a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1880242188539527568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being such a big fan of the manga</a>—that I thought to myself, “I’d really love to sing the opening for this manga whenever it becomes an anime.” I didn’t know if I could do it, though, or if I was the right choice or experienced enough, but sure enough, the offer came to me from my label. My producer wanted to meet with me to give me the good news, and that’s how I knew it was really good news.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn’t feel real at first when I got the offer, but as I started making the song, it became a lot more real very quickly. It’s been a crazy emotional time, but I’m really happy to have been given the opportunity as a huge fan of the manga. I’d even say it’s <a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1796936112876974332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my favorite manga ever</a>, so I’m just really happy to be here.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="BEHIND GACHIAKUTA | Creators Interview &amp; Behind-the-scenes" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQQF81ubINM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What about <em>Gachiakuta </em>drew you to liking it enough to want to make a theme song for it? Was there something about its world, tone, art style, or characters that immediately clicked with you and your musical style?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Honestly, I feel like the first thing that drew me into wanting to read more of the manga was definitely Urana's art style, because there's just this amazing combination of Western and Eastern sensibilities within the art. I'm a really big fan of Western cartoons. I know that Urana is also a fan of Western cartoons, and even back in the day when I used to draw, I'd combine those art styles together and always think, “I wish I could be better at this.” Seeing Urana’s art, I felt this is the exact style that I’ve longed to see in any piece of media and I just love it so much.&nbsp;</p><p>I also love the way Urana writes characters as well and their relationships with each other. Everybody’s got their own story going on, but they all intersect in a really beautiful way. And this overarching theme of becoming more and more human together in a dark and desolate world… I just love it so much. I think Urana’s a fantastic storyteller.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta Opening | &quot;HUGs&quot; by Paledusk" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9f89PWhv8YE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s first cour opening, “Hugs” by metalcore band Paledusk, as well as its original soundtrack, saw the anime lean heavily into rap and heavy metal genres—things you’ve also embraced over the years with your own original songs. Having listened to your theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” I wanted to ask if there was a particular character, arc, or emotional beat in the lead-up to <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour that served as the emotional anchor for the song’s lyrics, tone, and title?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I was informed that this cour—without giving too much away—you can already tell from the PV that there’s a lot of battles going on. Because I was informed about that, I knew I had to make something that was very dynamic and impactful as much as possible. So I tried to lean a little bit more into the anisong feeling—rock rap with a little bit of metal in there as well. Just a touch of it, it’s more rock than anything, I think.</p><p>But in particular, I really wanted to channel Rudo’s rage. It’s one of the main things that got me into the comic and kept me reading—wanting to learn more about his story and seeing the results of his anger come to a head over time through his character development. At the beginning of the song, you may hear an iconic line from Rudo, except I’m the one screaming it. I hope fans will look forward to that for sure, because I wanted to write most of it from Rudo's perspective. But the song also includes a lot of hopefulness, as well as what I feel he has gotten from befriending the Cleaners. I hope that it will be a fitting second cour opening.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kei Urana/Hideyoshi Andou/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Was there any particular moment in production, whether it's a lyric or a riff, where you geeked out over singing?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>A lot of lyrics within the song draw from specific moments within the manga, and now the anime as well. I didn’t write all of them. I only wrote the English lyrics, but especially in the intro, I want fans to listen to that. There are some parts that I rap in the first verse that I think are very indicative of what Rudo’s inner monologue might be, so I want people to focus on those parts, as well as the screams that I do in the chorus that have this big ensemble feeling for this ensemble show.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did you read ahead in the manga or preview episodes from the second cour to get in the headspace of writing the lyrics for the song, or were you only given a concept of where the story was going to go emotionally to have to match that sonically?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>By the time I got the offer, I was already caught up with <em>Gachiakuta</em>. Up until the actual production of the song, I just kept rereading it (maybe out of excitement as well). I was really hype about that. But of course, we also got requests from the production side as well. We had a formal meeting where I got to meet everybody working on the anime and hear their requests for what they wanted the song to sound like, including Urana’s request. I combined those with my own ideas and sensibilities about what I wanted the song to sound like.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="[MV] Wanted, Wasted - Mori Calliope x Takuya Yamanaka (THE ORAL CIGARETTES)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEHbF1PsLI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What was Urana’s specific request for what this cour theme would sound like?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> She specifically wanted something intense.&nbsp; Of course, rock is a huge part of the world of <em>Gachiakuta</em>, but she also wanted me to do a lot of shouts and yells as well.<strong> </strong>Interestingly enough, there was a song that I wrote a couple of years ago that I very openly said was inspired&nbsp; by <em>Gachiakuta</em>. She referenced that song of mine. It’s called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXwCOIwQZ18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanted Wasted</a>.” I wrote the lyrics in English for that song and created that song with <em>Gachiakuta </em>in mind. So she brought up that song and said she’d like it to sound like that as well my song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbNF8FqzIMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cult Following</a>” from my <a href="https://lnk.to/mc_PHANTOMIME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantomine </a>album.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> As a VTuber whose persona and aesthetic are deeply rooted in anime, what does it mean to you to have your voice officially tied to a series like <em>Gachiakuta </em>that’s being heralded as the next big shonen series?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s honestly a complete and total dream come true for me. Even now, it doesn’t totally feel real. I’m honored that Urana is a fan of mine, as I am also a huge fan of hers. That’s kind of how our friendship was born—from just being fans of each other. I feel happy and also lucky. The stars really aligned on this one. That’s why the production of the song was very difficult for me, because I wanted to make the song as good as possible because it means so much to me.&nbsp;</p><p>I think from here on out, even if I do receive offers for other songs, this was really my true end goal: to make an opening or a song for something that I love so much. So I’m just extremely happy about it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">wwww ナイス帽子ぺこ！！！</p>— Mori Calliope💀holoEN (@moricalliope) <a href="https://twitter.com/moricalliope/status/1949491897040601191?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> You recently had a solo concert that you performed earlier this year. Is there ever a feedback loop between being a VTuber and a musician?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> In this industry, there are people who focus on one, the other, or both. There are certainly folks that want music to be their main image, but I think it’s a difficult path to walk because you need to focus mostly on originals and maybe some covers, and streaming should be supplemental to your musical activities. Then there are folks that want to focus mostly on streaming, being a personality. They might make some character songs, but that’s about it.&nbsp;</p><p>From where I’m standing, I have always been a musician. I was a musician before beginning this career, and I’ve always wanted it to be central to my image. But I love streaming so much that I feel like streaming has also become very essential to who I am. So I’m a bit of a hybrid, I guess.</p><p>My hope is that from here on out, as a virtual artist, more virtual artists might be able to get these kinds of opportunities, because a lot of us are taking music very seriously and are working very hard to create music as our main activities. I’m looking forward to seeing what else could come from this opportunity that I’ve gotten here for the world of VTubers, virtual artists, virtual singers, etc.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Bones Film</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>&nbsp;Beforehand, anime was a niche thing no one really talked about, but it’s become a big thing everyone’s talking about. Likewise, VTubing evolved from being a subgenre of live streaming to becoming more commonplace. Do you see this kind of crossover, where VTubers contribute to an anime’s sonic identity, as part of a larger shift in how mainstream streaming culture and traditional pop culture media are blending together?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> I feel like, as you said, [VTubing has] always been very separate. But now, because anime is becoming more mainstream, you see it happening especially from big shonen getting even bigger overseas—for example, all the people that love <em>Gachiakuta </em>as well would be a testament to that. Because VTubing is intrinsically tied to anime, I feel it’s a natural result of anime becoming more mainstream overseas and globally. Because of that, I feel that VTubing is also moving in that direction, and [especially] streaming on platforms like Twitch or YouTube, [which] are integrating our existence more into the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m very much focused on the anime sphere of things. Anime and games are where I’m based and where I like to be. But I think that from here on out, more YouTubers that have an interest in hitting the mainstream will probably be able to branch out there for sure. We’ll see more of that happening in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | Official Cour 2 Trailer | Crunchyroll" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wId1ejSTvcA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>You can hear a snippet of Mori Calliope's "Let's Just Crash" here.</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What do you hope fans feel in their souls whenever they hear your theme song for <em>Gachiakuta</em>, both as a VTuber artist, musician, and anime fan?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I want people to remember this song in a similar way that I remember anime openings from my childhood. There are gonna be people out there who are kids that will—hopefully—remember this song as they grow older in the same way that I have with my past favorite OPs. If they could feel, as the song says in Japanese, “hope in the gutter,” then I would be extremely happy if this song could give people an outlet for their tumultuous feelings inside but still finding hope within the dirtiness and darkness of the world. That would make me extremely happy.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>fans can look forward to hearing Mori Calliope’s opening theme, “Let’s Just Crash,” in the anime’s second cour, which debuts on October 12 on Crunchyroll.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="4078b5dd58b4e"><a title="Mina The Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4078b5dd58b4e/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games' new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> was on track for a 31st October 2025 release, but it seems the plans have now changed.</p>
<p>In an official statement on the company's website, the "delay extravanganza" continues – with the team behind this new retro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening_dx">Zelda</a>-inspired adventure having to make the "tough decision" to delay the title on Switch, Switch 2, and all other platforms, as "it's just not quite there yet". Fortunately, this delay isn't a major one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbewgnsjr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</p>
<p>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line.</p>
<p>The game is <em>so</em> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</p>
<p>- Finalizing design, art, and sound<br>
- Overall game balancing<br>
- Implementing localization<br>
- Eating cheese<br>
- Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there's no new release date just yet, but again, it sounds like fans won't have to wait too long, as it's adding the final polish to select areas to make the game "truly shine". The original launch date was previously revealed in August of this year, and alongside it was the launch of a free demo, which will even carry over save data to the final build.</p>
<p>Over the past month, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> have also been delayed.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-govee-smart-lamp-stock-now-selling-for-less-than-a-basic-floor-lamp-2000632160</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-govee-smart-lamp-stock-now-selling-for-less-than-a-basic-floor-lamp.1318102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your living room deserves smart lighting that doesn’t drain your wallet. Smart floor lamps have become incredibly popular for transforming spaces with dynamic colors and voice control but the price tags often make people think twice. Not anymore. Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Govee RGBIC floor lamp has dropped to just $64 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. This Prime Big Deal Days offer <strong>marks an all-time low</strong> for one of the most popular smart lamps on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another mood-decorating, color-changing lamp: The Govee floor lamp is 136cm high and<strong> produces 1000 lumens of light which means it genuinely functions as actual light for your room</strong> (rather than mood decoration). At that level of brightness, it places it on a par with standard floor lamps so you can employ it for reading, working or ambient room light when it’s day, then shift over to bright color modes when night falls.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Smart Lamp Worth Your Money</h2>
<p>The RGBIC tech (that IC means <em>Independent Control</em>) distinguishes this lamp from less expensive ones: <strong>Each of the light strip segments is capable of showing disparate colors at the same time</strong>&nbsp;which lets you have flowing rainbow effects or gradients or multi-color schemes that plain RGB lamps aren’t up for. At your fingertips, <strong>you’re looking at 16 million different available colors and 58 dynamic built-in scenes</strong> named Cheerful, Romantic, and the like. Want your lamp pulsing red and orange, like a campfire? Done. Want a chilly blue-to-purple gradient for a late gaming marathon? Easy. The range goes deep enough that you’ll be able to fine-tune your lamp with holiday decorations or a party theme or just your mood of the moment without ever using the same look twice.</p>



<p>Voice command with Alexa or Google Home allows you never to have to rummage for your phone. Simply ask your smart speaker to turn the lamp on, change the hue, or reduce the brightness while cooking, working, or already settled on the sofa. The Govee Home app (installable through QR code on the box) adds additional control features with scheduling, so your lamp automatically wakes you gently with morning hues or unwinds with warm hues at bedtime. The app interface makes it simple to create custom scenes, allowing you to set specific hues for varying segments of a scene and then save your favorite sets for instant recall.</p>
<p>With sync mode,<strong> this light springs to life at parties, movie nights, or when playing video games</strong>. Inner microphones detect sound in the room and translate it into dynamic, real-time changes in brightness. Thump-heavy tunes create pulsing results, dialogues stay gentle, and action scenes erupt with corresponding changes in color. This dynamic lighting delivers real immersion for entertainment without cluttered setup.</p>
<p>The physical build makes this lamp suitable for real homes: Aluminum construction makes it firm (non-wobbling, non-tipping) yet light enough for simple transport from one room to another. Sections on the base fasten immediately without tools. At 136cm tall, it comfortably inhabits a corner, behind a sofa or next to a desk without overwhelming your space.</p>
<p>Stock sells out fast on Prime Big Deal Days, so this all-time-low pricing won’t last indefinitely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock launched the Saros 10R in June 2025 and introduced its latest flagship generation that redefines what premium robot vacuums can achieve. This is <strong>the most advanced model in Roborock’s entire lineup</strong>, and it delivers power and capabilities that dwarf every other robot vacuum currently sold on Amazon.</p>
<p>Now, for Prime Big Deal Days, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">technological marvel has dropped to a new record low of $1,199, down from its usual $1,599</a>. The reason people invest in premium robot vacuums like this is simple: they want their <strong>floors genuinely clean</strong> without lifting a finger, and cheaper models simply can’t deliver the thoroughness, intelligence, or convenience that justify the automation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22,000 Pa Suction Power Eradicates Dirt on Entire Surfaces</h2>
<p>Conventional robot vacuums are 3.8 to 4 inches high due to the necessity for a raised LDS (<em>Laser Distance Sensor</em>) tower on top for mapping. Roborock Saros 10R features the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 which eliminates the extending sensor unit and <strong>reduces the profile to a mere 3.14 inches high</strong>. The vacuum slides under beds, sofas, cabinets and coffee tables that stand in the way of chunkier rivals.</p>
<p>The 3D sensing capabilities accurately map rooms even under spindly-legged furniture and drop-down cabinets with the VertiBeam Lateral Obstacle Avoidance system avoiding obstructions such as cables and poly-legged furniture legs without getting stuck. The advanced algorithms identify and respond to 108 different types of obstructions, so the vacuum cleans your whole home without incessant supervision or rescue interventions.</p>



<p>The <strong>HyperForce suction system produces 22,000 pascals of vacuum pressure</strong> which is about double/triple what mid-range robot vacuums deliver. This brute strength removes ground-in dirt from carpet fibers, draws out debris from grout gaps between tiles, and sucks up fine dust particles from hardwood left behind by weaker robots. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide main brush features a <strong>dual-sided design that keeps hair from tangling around the roller</strong>, automatically ejecting and depositing long hair and pet fur directly into the dustbin. The FlexiArm Riser side brush <strong>extends automatically when it senses corners and edging</strong>, sweeping out debris from baseboards and cramped corners that round robots almost universally ignore.</p>



<p>The first-of-its-type AdaptiLift Chassis adjusts the height of the robot dynamically, navigating through obstructions up to 4 cm high like door thresholds, area rug corners, and U-shaped chair leg furnishings that would cause lighter robots to stall. As soon as it senses carpet, <strong>the two rotating cleaning mops and their mounting bracket automatically lift up</strong> so you don’t wet your carpets, then lower when returning to hard floors.</p>
<p>The multifunctional dock 4.0 handles ten different maintenance tasks autonomously: It washes mops with 176-degree Fahrenheit hot water, dries them with 131-degree hot air to prevent mildew, <strong>empties the robot’s dustbin automatically with 60 days of capacity</strong>, refills the water tank, dispenses cleaning solution, and even cleans itself with hot water. The dock recharges the robot in 2.5 hours, and when it detects heavily soiled areas during cleaning, it triggers automatic re-wash and re-mop cycles for deep cleaning.</p>
<p>At $1,199 during Prime Big Deal Days, the Saros 10R costs less than several mid-range variants but delivers flagship performance for which full automation is justified.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This weekend, Amazon dropped the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2)</strong> to $429 for early <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> access. Now the retailer has taken things even further by lowering the displayed price to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">plus an additional 10% off at checkout for eligible buyers, bringing the final cost down to potentially $359 (down from $799)</a>. This is an absolute record low price for this power station, and here’s what makes it remarkable: <strong>no competitor offering a 1500W portable power station has ever come close to this pricing</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’re<strong> looking at half off the usual $799 retail price</strong> on a product that solves one of the most frustrating problems for campers, RV owners and anyone preparing for emergencies. Running out of power during outdoor adventures or losing electricity during storms creates genuine hardship, and the Jackery Explorer 1000 provides enough capacity and output to keep essential devices running for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Days of Power, Not Hours</h2>
<p>The 1070 watt-hour capacity provides robust energy storage translating to real-world usage most users are familiar with. You’ll be able to <strong>charge a laptop around 10 times, run a mini-fridge for approximately 15 hours</strong>, support LED lights for a few days or run a CPAP unit for a number of evenings. The LiFePO4 battery chemistry is a step up from lithium-ion batteries employed for lower-end power stations: LiFePO4 batteries last for approximately 4,000 charge cycles until capacity dips at 80%, for reference, standard lithium-ion batteries last for around 500 to 1,000 cycles at the 80% level.</p>
<p>The majority of portable power stations have a peak output of between 300W and 500W which makes for charging small devices like cell phones or a mini portable fan at once. The <strong>1500W of continuous output with a 3000W surge delivers</strong> sufficient power for actual household devices like microwaves, electric kettles, power tools, or a small air conditioner unit. The surge amount addresses the starting burst of power when starting motors which is relevant for devices like refrigerators that consume several multiples of their-rated wattage for a number of seconds at starting time. The unit contains <strong>everyday AC outlets</strong> which accept typical three-prong plugs, and a<strong> 100W USB-C Power Delivery outlet</strong> for quick charging a laptop or tablet without bulky AC adapters.</p>



<p>The fast charging for one hour <strong>allows you to go from zero to full battery in 60 minutes</strong> via a common wall outlet which is extremely fast for a battery of this size. Most rival power stations need 6-8 hours for a full recharge. This quick turnaround is priceless on multi-day camping trips when you may have shore power available for a few hours here or there, or when there are rolling blackouts when you have a quick top-off between outages. The unit also has solar charging capabilities with optional solar panels, allowing you to have power on tap indefinitely off-grid when you harness energy from the sun during the day.</p>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 currently the <strong>highest-rated best-seller on Amazon for generators for outdoors</strong>, with over 4,000 units sold this month alone and a 4.6-star overall rating out of nearly 3,000 reviews. At $359 using the checkout discount on Prime Big Deal Days, you pay less than some 500Wh power centers with half the capacity and a much lower lifespan.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space-2000632140</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space.1318066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Air models dominate Apple’s laptop sales because they handle everyday computing needs for the vast majority of users (without the complexity or cost of Pro models). The catch has always been the price: You need to budget at least $1,000 for the standard configuration and upgrades can quickly push you toward $1,500, the territory where MacBook Pro models begin.</p>
<p>For <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em>, Amazon has essentially eliminated its entire profit margin on the best-selling configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">bringing the 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 chip down to $799 from its usual $999</a>. This represents the lowest price ever for the 2025 model <strong>with 256GB storage and 16GB unified memory</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Designed for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s latest silicon design which is <strong>custom-built for handling Apple Intelligence features</strong> which require intensive processing for on-device AI calculations. That means features like sophisticated editing of photos, real-time translation, voice transcription, and intelligent writing assistant are executed locally on your laptop rather than being sent off to cloud servers.</p>
<p>The performance benefit extends beyond AI features: The M4 handles dozens of web tabs, many productivity applications, video calling and background applications without a hitch or fan functioning. Because it is fanless, the <strong>MacBook Air stays silent for any amount of intensive usage</strong>&nbsp;which is not possible for regular Intel-based laptops which require active heat management when under load.</p>



<p>Apple’s unified memory architecture pools RAM across the CPU, the GPU, and the Neural Engine, so data moves between disparate processing units without the performance penalty that individual pools of memory cause in older computer architectures. The 16GB setup affords sufficient headroom for professional uses like photo editing in Final Cut Pro, video editing or virtual machines. This is important because earlier versions of the MacBook Air had 8GB, which meant that users had to constantly juggle what apps they had open.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display uses IPS LCD tech with a resolution of 2560 pixels by 1664 pixels</strong>. The Liquid Retina display includes the P3 wide color gamut, a brightness of 500 nits and remains legible outdoors under direct sunlight when cheaper laptop screens dim down and become unreadable. True Tone tech automatically changes colour temperature based on ambient illumination for less eye strain when working for long periods at a time.</p>
<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera at last elevates MacBook video call quality. <strong>Center Stage utilizes machine learning when you’re on the go</strong>, automatically framing you by zooming and panning to create the ideal video call composition. This gives you a more professional appearance when participating in online Zoom conferences and eliminates the bothersome need for you to repeatedly shift your position or angle to remain visible on camera.</p>
<p>This laptop sells for $799 on Prime Big Deal Days, which places the 2025 MacBook Air M4 on equal terms truly with mid-range Windows notebooks but with Apple’s superior build quality, battery life, and ecosystem integration.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/megabonk-quick-review.1318063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk is a 3D survivors-like with a very <em>specific </em>sense of humor that has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/why-this-indie-game-is-going-viral">getting a lot of buzz lately</a>. I've played about 15 hours as of writing this, so while this quick look is more meant to share my early impressions across that time rather than being a full, scored review, I’ve already done plenty worth talking about. There is still a fair bit I haven't seen, but I got a little more than half the achievements and unlockables in that time, and I have been enjoying myself a lot. Adding an extra axis of movement does a lot to set it apart, and it's more than competent at all the usual conventions of the genre already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've played these kinds of games before, the basics are pretty much the same. You run around and fight endlessly-spawning waves of enemies that get harder and harder as the time ticks down. It'll start with little goblins, and then you'll get goblins with swords, and eventually build up to some more dangerous stuff like ogres or giant scorpions. Every once in a while a miniboss will pop up and those add some variety and a nice little spike of challenge. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also shrines that let you summon powerful elite packs and even more bosses with the promise of greater rewards, and I always appreciate that kind of thing where I'm not going into a menu and turning the difficulty up, but I can kind of tweak the difficulty as I go based on the decisions I make in the run. I prefer that, honestly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is common for these kinds of games, all of your weapons do their things automatically, whether that's a sword or a rocket launcher. The only controls you're worried about are movement-related. I like the variety and the bombastic attitude of the weapons. There are no two that feel overly similar, and they're all pretty fun to use in different situations. Getting the revolver and the missiles and stacking bonuses to the number of projectiles I can spawn is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course the most obvious and I think the coolest difference here is that Megabonk is built with fully 3D levels and 3D movement. You can jump, and even get power-ups that give you better jumps or double, triple, quadruple jumps which is a ton of fun. There's an item that makes all your weapons do more damage while you're airborne, which can be quite powerful. One of the characters, Monke, can actually climb walls, which gives him some big advantages.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a frantic but tactical loop of going fast while planning out your path carefully.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And this exploration and planning routes across steep cliffs, up and down ramps, is a big part of Megabonk, which makes every run feel interesting and challenging in some ways a lot of survivors-style games aren't. First off, to finish a level, you have to locate the boss gate so you can summon the final boss before the timer runs out and you're eventually overwhelmed by endless waves of ghosts. So there's that added need to get out and comb the map, unless you get lucky and spawn right by the boss gate which sometimes happens, and I like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then the second part is that the map is littered with breakable containers, shrines, and chests, and your power level is going to be directly related to how many of these you can hit within the time limit before you move on to the next level. So there's this frantic but also very tactical loop where you want to go fast while planning out your path carefully to avoid backtracking and tag as many points of interest as possible. Chests also, at least most of them, cost gold to open, and that price goes up every time you open one, so sometimes you have to know when to pass one up because it's not worth waiting around to farm coins when you're not going to be able to afford to open every single chest anyway. The number of considerations I have to weigh in my head to put together a really good run feels satisfying and like I can usually overcome at least a lot of the capricious force of randomness by playing smart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now I do have to talk about the humor, because it's one of the first things I noticed. The entire theme of Megabonk seems to be Millennial and Gen Z internet brain rot. And it's honestly hard to tell if – at the rist of sounding a bit mean or snotty – this supposed to genuinely make me laugh in a surface-level way. Like is this the straightforward sense of humor the developers were aiming for? Or are they doing a Tim and Eric cringe comedy thing, like the <em>real</em> joke is that it's kind of stupid on purpose? How many layers of irony deep are we? In the former case, it doesn't work that well. But if it's the latter, it kind of does.<br>Yeah, in 2025, I'm totally still sending my friends all the latest GigaChads. Remember him? There's an item that spawns "borgars." Dang, did John Hammond show up to pop your champagne after you dug that one up? (The irony is not lost on me that I'm using a reference from a 1993 movie to criticize how old this meme is, but it's a classic, okay?) There's a surprisingly safe for work boss called "Scorpionussy." There's a power-up that "claps cheeks." Practically everything you pick up is some kind of reference to years- or decades-old meme culture. It never got in the way of the gameplay for me, but there were a few times I thought my eyes were going to roll so hard I might sever my optic nerves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk currently only has two levels, a spooky forest and a deadlier desert, at least unless there are some secret ones I'm not aware of. But they do each have three different tiers of increasing difficulty. The first is just a single stage, while each subsequent tier adds one additional stage with a new boss that lets you carry over all your power-ups from the previous one. I do find the lack of changing scenery a bit disappointing. Those two biomes are definitely starting to feel repetitive, and I couldn't find anything like a roadmap that said the devs plan to add more. It's not labeled as Early Access either. But the three tiers definitely provide a good challenge and give me more room to push myself.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Roguelikes and lites</h3><p>Some of my favorite Roguelikes/lites from over the years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meta-progression isn't super deep, but it is meaningful and rewarding. Everything outside of a run costs a separate currency called silver that you can pick up on runs. Getting permission to buy new characters, items, and power-ups requires you to first complete an objective or achievement thematically tied to each one, which is kind of neat. Then you have the more straightforward buffs to level up like getting more rerolls or more weapon slots. I appreciated that you only have to pay for the ability to toggle unlocked items on or off once and then you can use it as much as you want, since I really like to optimize my loot pool going into a run in these types of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are mostly pretty simple in their design but enjoyable to use. I think my favorite is CL4NK who is a robot cowboy gunslinger that starts with the revolver and gets increased critical chance every level. But you've also got a skeleton on a skateboard who does more damage the faster he moves, and the ninja is also a lot of fun because he automatically kills any enemy who misses him with an attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as survivors-likes go, this is a pretty strong one. Especially with the added consideration of the jump button and the whole vertical axis, and the emphasis on route-planning and exploration, I found it had that crucial ability to make me want to start a new run as soon as I finished the last until it was suddenly several hours later. I'm regularly groaning at some of the uninspired image board humor, but I feel like I can sometimes appreciate it in an ironic way, and otherwise just ignore it. I'd say it's worth a look if you have an appetite for another one of these that isn't basically just a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review">Vampire Survivors</a> reskin. I just wish there was a little more level variety.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is quite clearly a Halloween game. The thing about Halloween is that there should always be a little bit silliness amongst the horrific and the scary, and Yacht Club Games' next retro throwback seemed quite well fitted for the season. It was so appropriate that it was even planned to be released on October 31st! All of this to say, yes, Mina the Hollower is delayed, and it doesn't have a new release date either.
</p>
<p>
"The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet," Yacht Club Games explained in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a> announcing the delay. "This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine." They also noted in the post that a new release date isn't being revealed just yet, as they're waiting until the game is submitted to its various platforms.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, it is apparently "so close to being done," and it sounds like it's only smaller things like finalising design, art, and sound, balance tweaks, localisation testing, platform testing, and the act of eating cheese that's holding up the release that was meant to take place this month.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, this is definitely a bit of a shame as I have been hankering for something akin to the GBC Zelda games, and I love a Halloween activity given I am not too far away from my thirties and am very childless so trick or treating is not something I can partake in. On the other hand, as ever there are too many games - both Unbeatable and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> are launching in the first half of November, and boy howdy do I not have the time for either of them.
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed Yatch Club Games find a new release date soon enough! And selfishly, one that's far away from other games I also want to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October was going to be a special month. For the first time since <em>Shovel Knight</em> came out over a decade ago, Yacht Club Games was going to release a new game that had nothing to do with its hit 8-bit platformer. It’s a <em>Link’s Awakening</em>-sized adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-mina-the-hollower-zelda-castlevania-game-1848463038">called <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>. Unfortunately, it also just got indefinitely delayed.</p> <p>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay <em>Mina the Hollower</em>,” the studio wrote in <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a new blog post on Monday</a>. “The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.”</p>

 <p>Unlike its 2D side-scrolling predecessor,<em> Mina the Hollower</em> is a top-down action game that focuses a bit more on puzzles and combat. Think <em>Castlevania</em> if it fell on the ground with a <em>Zelda</em>-inspired interconnected map. It has all the signs of becoming another clever, charming retro homage if Yacht Club can deliver. Apparently, it still needs more time to cook. There’s no new release date yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily far away from finally coming out.</p>

 <p>“We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line,” Yacht Club wrote today. “The game is&nbsp;<i>so</i> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day.” In the meantime, the developers say they’re working on finalizing design, art, sound, game balance, localization, and QA.</p> <p><em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the third notable game <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">to drop out of the busy October release calendar lineup</a>. Roguelike dungeon game <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>moved to November and <i>Kingmakers </i>is missing its Early Access date this week with no new date announced yet. <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the one I was looking forward to most, however. I’d love to be spending my end-of-year travel season cozied up to my Switch like it’s 1998 again and the Game Boy Color just came out. We’ll see if it still ends up arriving in time for the holiday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon-2000632012</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon.1318015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>GoPro almost never puts its cameras on sale</strong>. Outside of a handful of major shopping events each year, and exclusively through Amazon, you’re paying full price. That’s why <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> and Black Friday are the only real opportunities to snag a deal on their latest gear. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/">the HERO13 Black bundle (including two batteries) is down to $399 from its usual $499, and this is an all-time low for the newest model</a>. If you’ve been waiting to document your ski trips, capture your kids’ soccer games from unique angles, mount a camera on your mountain bike for trail footage or simply record your travels in stunning quality that your phone can’t match, this is your moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This package comes complete with goodies that truly make a difference: You receive <strong>two Enduro batteries</strong>, which is a big deal because action camera batteries have a short life when you’re recording in chilly weather or capturing high-def video. Enduro batteries are also designed to hold up better when it’s cold outside and have a longer overall life, <strong>giving you up to 2.5 hours of solid 5.3K recording per battery pack</strong>.</p>
<p>Another welcome innovation is t<strong>he waterproof shutter remote</strong> which allows you to initiate recording or stop recording from a distance of up to 196 feet away. This allows you to affix the GoPro HERO 13 Black camera on your helmet, your ride or a tripod and operate it without awkwardly pressing the small buttons on the camera which is extremely handy when your hands are gloved or the camera is mounted somewhere out of easy reach.</p>



<h2>Film-Like Experience That Accommodates Your Trek</h2>
<p>The <strong>HERO13 Black captures at 5.3K resolution</strong> which provides 91% more information than regular 4K and a whopping 665% more resolution than 1080p. That extra resolution provides serious leeway in post-editing. Crop-in on your shots, firm up shaky frames or punch-in on details without sacrificing quality. The GoPro Quik app even allows you to <strong>pull 24.7-megapixel still images straight out of your 5.3K video</strong>&nbsp;so you never have a bad photo because you happened to be recording video rather than pics.</p>
<p>One of the coolest capabilities is <strong>Burst Slo-Mo which takes action at 13 times normal speed</strong>. Just think about being able to capture a skate trick, a breaking wave, or a bike jump with all the little details witnessed in silky smooth slow motion. And you <strong>can capture 4x slow motion at the full 5.3K resolution</strong>&nbsp;which creates extremely detailed slo-mo video that freezes movements and moments your eye might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>The GoPro HERO13 Black includes native support for HB-Series Lenses that are automatically switched when you put them on the camera. The Ultra Wide Lens Mod is perfect for POV shots when you need to see all that’s in front of you, from ski slopes to surf sessions. The Macro Lens Mod places you very close to the subject for close-ups of small objects, details, or animals. Neutral Density filters enable you to naturally blur fast-paced scenes for motion blur and exposure control for sunny scenes, adding a cinematic effect to your clips.</p>
<p>Designed to withstand the toughest environments, the <strong>HERO13 Black is water-resistant up to 33 feet without the need for extra housing</strong>. Water-repellent lens cover minimizes lens flare, giving you clear shots even when wet.</p>
<p>For that price, getting the complete bundle with two batteries is a steal.</p>

                <p>The follow-up to Yacht Club's indie hit Shovel Knight will have to wait a little longer, as the studio has announced that Mina the Hollower will be delayed out of its previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shovel-knight-devs-mina-the-hollower-launches-on-halloween-demo-out-now/1100-6532145/" data-ref-id="1100-6532145">Halloween release date</a>. While Yacht Club said this delay will be a short one, it isn't prepared to nail down an exact date just yet.</p><p>"This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower," the team wrote on its <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>. "The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on October 31, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine."</p><p>Though the delay is short, though, Yacht Club said it doesn't want to announce a new release date until it's submitted to all platforms. In the meantime, it's working on finalizing design, art, and sound, game balancing, localization, and testing. And eating cheese.</p><p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that," the studio said.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is Yacht Club's first original franchise after the breakout success of Shovel Knight in 2014. The studio has been busy in the meantime, though, creating loads of extra DLC campaigns for Shovel Knight, as well as developing and publishing spin-offs like Shovel Knight Showdown and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is inspired by the classic top-down Zelda games, with an art style that pays homage to that color palette as well. It stars a little mouse in a kingdom of animals, and as the name implies, she can burrow underground to solve puzzles and surprise enemies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Shovel Knight Developer Yacht Club Games has delayed its anticipated follow-up, the Zelda-inspired <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/mina-the-hollower-the-next-game-from-the-creators-of-shovel-knight-launches">Mina the Hollower</a>. The upcoming game was scheduled to launch on October 31.</p><p>Initially crowdfunded via Kickstarter, Mina the Hollower centers on the titular mouse, a scientist and explorer who embarks on a mission to rescue a cursed island. The top-down action game sports a retro aesthetic reminiscent of Game Boy Color titles while its combat evokes The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania. As a Hollower, Mina can burrow underground, which plays a substantial role in combat and exploration.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a>, Yacht Club explains that despite working tirelessly to get Mina ready for launch, &nbsp;it says, “we’re just not quite there yet.” The studio then clarifies that the delay won’t be a big one, and the team will spend this time applying additional polish, fine-tuning balancing, finalizing art and sound, and implementing localization.</p><p>“With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!" reads Yacht Club's blog post. Yacht Club did not announce a new launch date for Mina the Hollower, as it wants to wait until the game is submitted to platforms for review.&nbsp;</p><p>Mina the Hollower is currently slated to launch on PC and all major consoles, including a recently announced Switch 2 version.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> lives! Well, of course it does, it would be quite shocking if PlayStation were to cancel it before it even got a chance to become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> 2, but that's neither here nor there. What is here, and soon to be there, is another playtest, of which sign-ups are now available. It is being dubbed a "closed technical test," and plans to run for just a few days, between October 22nd and October 28th, but there are a few differences to be found compared to when we last saw it.
</p>
<p>
For starters, this playtest will take place across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, and it'll be available in both North America and Europe this time. Worth noting is that it is under NDA, so you in particular shouldn't go blabbering about it, let some content creator desperate for views do that instead.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what will be available in the test, there'll be three maps to play through and five runner shells to try out. A big change is that the game will now have proximity chat, and notably, a solo queue - in previous playtests you could only play in teams of three, and even if you could launch into a match solo, you'd be at a real disadvantage. On top of that there's "re-tuned combat pacing… deeper environmental storytelling, and more." 
</p>
<p>
Whether any of that is enough to make it a good game? Hard to say until someone plays it, but even if this is only a brief overview of what's new, it'll need to feel quite radically different to make an impact. I'm not sure if it sounds like it'll manage that just yet.
</p><p>
Heading to the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">blog post</a> about the network test will take you to a form where you can apply to take part in it, which you can do so until October 16th, or from October 13th you'll be able to do so via Steam directly (sign-ups there will run until October 26th).
</p>
<p>
It's interesting that this playtest is under NDA, given how publicly poor the reception was earlier this year. Certainly sounds like Bungie is continuing an attempt at doing some damage control. The last update we had on the game is that it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinitely delayed</a>, which is still the case, obviously not a good sign for the state of the game. Updates in the following months after the test were promised, so we'll have to wait and see where Marathon ends up landing next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a special battle in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactic</em>s</a> that’s been punishing unsuspecting players for generations. Thanks to <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster, fresh recruits can witness the joy and terror of randomly getting jumped by 11 monks in one of the strategy RPG’s lesser-known endgame challenges.</p> <p>Every spot on the map in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> comes with an <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">array of random encounters</a> the game can pull from depending on which side you enter from and how far along you are in the story. Once you hit Chapter 4, the game’s “rare” random encounters become accessible. These special battles are weird, hard, and memorable. None more so than the 11-Monk brawl on Grogh Heights (known in the original PS1 version as Grog Hill). They hit hard and have great range thanks to the Monk’s versatile Martial Arts abilities. God help you if you accidentally drop into the battle while trying to train your squad up on weaker jobs they don’t have many abilities for.</p>

   <p>Fans on the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> subreddit have been posting about these Monks for years. Every so often, someone new to the game takes a photo, uploads it in a thread, and writes something to the effect of “WTF?” Community hero Kronikle has been cataloging every instance and posting each of them under every new thread. This happened <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nyutyr/anyone_seen_a_random_battle_like_this_lol/">again over the weekend</a>.</p>

 <p>“Homie really pulled up with the receipts,” wrote one fan in response. “Dude replies this every time and adds to it. It’s my most favorite thing ever on this subreddit,” wrote another. A third chimed in, “gotta respect the dedication.”</p>

   <p>While the Monks are arguably the game’s most absurd rare battle, there’s close to <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/41329250">a dozen others</a> scattered across the map, each with a chance of occurring when you walk to that specific point from the right direction. A small army of Calculators can spawn at Lenalia Plateau, Yuguo Woods can spawn seven Samurai, and Germinas Peak can spawn a group of Chemists and Orators with powerful guns worth stealing. Certain rare monsters like Tiamats can only spawn in the Bariaus Valley rare battle.</p> <p>Some players seek these fights out in order to farm abilities off the crystals the enemies drop. Others just like the added challenge and variety. Most story battles in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> only draw from a very limited pool of Jobs, making the rare battles extra fun. Fortunately, with the Enhanced mode’s ability to retry and flee battles, you’ll never have to worry about seeing hours of progress get wiped out this way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082"><span>holding an online beta test</span></a><span> until October 8, so fans can play the online modes before the full game launches on November 14. Some players are having matchmaking issues, but I suppose identifying such issues is the whole point of betas, so that’s not too surprising. What is surprising, however, is that players were reporting earlier that </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s in-game text chat was censoring the name of another shooter launching soon. No, it’s not direct competitor </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>. It’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios.</span></p> <p><span>Players were reporting earlier today (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>) that if you sent “Arc Raiders”</span> <span>in the </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> beta’s text chat, the message that would actually pop up would just be a series of asterisks. According to those who tested it, the words “Arc” and “Raiders,” individually, seemed to get through the moderation system just fine. It was only when they were put together in that order that a switch flipped. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>, arguably </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>’s biggest competitor, didn’t seem to be affected, even after taking </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><span>shots at the military shooter in a recent ad</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified that this has since been patched out. I downloaded the beta myself. That was 52GB installed on my scalding hot gamer laptop just to type another game’s name into chat to see what happened.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> isn’t the type of game I would have expected Activision to view as a competitor or threat to </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>. It’s a science fiction extraction shooter in which, sure, you point and shoot at things, so maybe that was enough in someone’s eyes at Activision? I’m now curious what other games could be crossed out in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s backend. Embark Studios also made another shooter, </span><i><span>The Finals</span></i><span>, so it’s not like it’s a bright-eyed newcomer to making video games, but it’s still an odd target for Activision to hone in on. They’re not the only ones, as </span><i><span>Battlefield </span></i><span>publisher EA was also </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/"><span>censoring the game’s name in its apps</span></a><span>. What are y’all so scared of? Could it be an error? We’ve reached out to Activision and Embark Studios about the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision%E2%80%99s-ban-on-%E2%80%98arc-raiders%E2%80%99-in-black-ops-7-explained.1317964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed Call of Duty gamers have noticed that the term ‘ARC Raiders’ is censored in Black Ops 7’s text chat. This isn’t the first time this has happened in a game, as it was called out recently that Battlefield 6’s game chat had the same issue.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Activision to get to the truth of the question of why Black Ops 7 appears to be <strong>censoring </strong>mentions of ARC Raiders. In case you’re not in the know, ARC Raiders is a third-person extraction shooter set to drop on October 30, casting players into a harsh, ruined world to fight for survival.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-arc-raiders-censored-in-call-of-duty">Why is ARC Raiders Censored in Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>It’s not some nefarious thing, as it happens. We caught up with Activision’s PR team to get to the root of what seems like ARC Raiders censorship, which some have pegged as being some twisted corporate jealousy.</p>



<p>Here’s the message we received, which should set your mind at rest:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Glad you asked, it’s quite innocuous and I can provide you with the information on background. </p>



<p>Our text-based moderation system has ‘Arc’ set as an alt of an inappropriate word. </p>



<p>Paired with Raiders, the system flagged the phrase. Those filters have been adjusted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hilariously, Embark Studios made a tongue-in-cheek reference to this issue on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While we didn’t hear what the situation was with Electronic Arts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-censor-no-longer-present-ea-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s censorship</a> of ARC Raiders, we can safely assume it was a similar deal.</p>



<p>The Black Ops 7 beta kicked off late last week and is live until Wednesday, October 8. It has been met with a mostly positive reception thus far, despite some viewership and player numbers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-fail-top-battlefield-6-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on certain platforms</a> taking a while to get flowing.</p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming just a couple of days ago:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Black Ops 7 Beta Early Access is already off to a great start. The early response across all platforms has been tremendous, and we’ve only just begun. We look forward to the entire community, across all platforms, coming together to experience the Open Beta beginning Sunday.</p>

The game's multiplayer includes four distinct classes, and it's important to understand the different abilities and gadgets that come paired with each one so you can pick the classes best suited to your playstyle and preferred game modes. In this guide, we break down all the classes in Battlefield 6, including their respective gadgets, signature weapons, traits, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Battlefield_6_class_types">Battlefield 6 class types</a></li><li><a href="#Open_and_closed_weapon_systems">Open and closed weapon systems</a></li><li><a href="#Assault_class">Assault class</a><ul><li><a href="#Assault_gadgets">Assault gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Assault_class">Best weapons for Assault class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Engineer_class">Engineer class</a><ul><li><a href="#Engineer_gadgets">Engineer gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Engineer_class">Best weapons for Engineer class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Support_class">Support class</a><ul><li><a href="#Support_gadgets">Support gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Support_class">Best weapons for Support class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Recon_class">Recon class</a><ul><li><a href="#Recon_gadgets">Recon gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Recon_Class">Best weapons for Recon Class</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Battlefield_6_class_types">Battlefield 6 class types</h2><p dir="ltr">Starting with a simplified breakdown of the classes, they are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Assault:</strong> Frontline attackers who excel in close- to mid-range combat</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Engineer:</strong> Vehicle and destruction experts who can repair friendly vehicles and use a range of explosive equipment</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Support:</strong> A combat medic who assists teammates with healing, ammo resupplies, and quick revives</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recon:</strong> Experts in intelligence, infiltration, and deadly marksmanship</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Each class in Battlefield 6 is paired with a particular squad role. This is supported by a signature gadget, trait, and a skill with a specific weapon type. But don't worry, you <strong>aren't locked into one class type</strong>. You can make custom loadouts for each and swap on the fly mid-match.</p><p dir="ltr">All class types can be impactful on the modes for large maps, but smaller game modes like Squad Deathmatch are infantry only, making classes like the Engineer less useful.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Open_and_closed_weapon_systems">Open and closed weapon systems</h2><p dir="ltr">In the past, Battlefield's four signature roles featured a class-locked weapon system. This meant that Support players were limited to wielding light machine guns, the Recon class had sniper rifles, Engineers had submachine guns, and the Assault players were the only ones who got to use assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">In Battlefield 6, the developer is giving players the option to choose between playlists that feature closed or open weapon systems. The open system means you can pair any weapon class with any role you choose to play. However, there are some slight bonuses you can score for choosing to utilize the game's closed weapon system. Using the signature weapon assigned to a specific class gives you additional perks on the battlefield, such as improved hip-fire control for Engineers who choose a submachine gun. We'll explain these signature weapon benefits for each class below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Assault_class">Assault class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581196" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581196"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Assault class is probably the most straightforward and beginner-friendly role to play. In the Assault role, you're the frontline fighter who is equipped to charge toward objectives or the enemy line. You're armed with a grenade launcher and abilities geared for using breach and clear tactics.</p><p dir="ltr">If you used the Assault class in the beta, you'll find there are a few changes to the role for the launch of Battlefield 6. The signature trait has been adjusted to help speed up capturing objectives, and the Adrenaline Injector no longer provides self-healing abilities.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Assault Rifle. This grants faster transition from sprint to firing and switching to and from assault rifles</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Speeds up capturing objectives for nearby squad members and takes you and your team out of combat status faster</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Adrenaline Injector. This clears and boosts resistance to flash and stun effects, enhances tolerance to explosive and incendiary damage, and improves movement speed</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability: </strong>Nearby enemies that are audible become revealed for the player, with kills prolonging the effect</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Breacher: These units have quicker reloads on grenade launchers, can carry extra grenades, and are more resistant to flash effects.</li><li dir="ltr">Frontliner: These soldiers have improved health regeneration, an additional adrenaline injector charge, and reduced penalty when shooting on the move.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. <strong>Frontliner</strong> is going to be a great pick, especially for beginners, as it helps provide better health regeneration and comes with an additional Adrenaline Injector charge. <strong>Breacher</strong> is the choice if you're more excited about the game's destruction and just wanna blow stuff up.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Assault_gadgets">Assault gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Since the beta, the developer has also added additional gadgets exclusive to the Assault class to make them more helpful with a role focused on teamwork: Assault ladder and Deploy Beacon.</p><p dir="ltr">The ladder lets Assault players create higher vantage points for their team. The Deploy Beacon offers a spawn point, but it has a limited number of uses per squad and will self-destruct if the Assault player spawns back on it. This is designed to be a tactical and limited resource rather than a persistent advantage.</p><p dir="ltr">Other gadget options include: Thermobaric (fire) grenade launcher, high-explosive grenade launcher, and shotgun.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Assault_class">Best weapons for Assault class</h3><p dir="ltr">The <strong>NVO-228E assault rifle</strong> is one of the strongest picks for ARs in Battlefield 6. This assault rifle has a fast fire rate, and the recoil can be easily controlled with some of the gun's best attachments.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not focused on picking the class's signature weapon, the <strong>M4A1 carbine rifle</strong> is another great option for close to mid-range fights.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Engineer_class">Engineer class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581197" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581197"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Engineers play a crucial role in Battlefield 6. They're not only armed with rockets for destruction, but they're also the ones who are equipped with the repair tool capability for repairing their team's vehicles. Tanks are often used for bullying through enemy defenses and holding objectives with firepower, and a good Engineer is often following their friendly tanks, making sure those vehicles stay fit for the fight.</p><p dir="ltr">On the destruction side, Engineers make use of their rockets and explosives for disabling enemy vehicles and tactical destruction. A well-placed rocket or some other explosives can take down structures in a way that helps the team.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Submachine Guns: Improved hip-fire control</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait: </strong>Take reduced damage from explosives</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Repair Tool: Multitool for fixing friendly assets and armor. It can also be used to damage enemy assets</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> Overloads the repair tool to fix vehicles with enhanced efficiency</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training Paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Anti-Armor: A master of wreaking havoc on enemy vehicles with rockets that reduce repair effectiveness, as well as extra ammunition and faster reloads for launchers</li><li dir="ltr">Combat Engineer: An expert dedicated to keeping everything in pristine shape. This soldier auto-generates health of vehicles they're occupying, is able to use their repair tool longer before overheating, and can automatically spot nearby mines</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. One is geared towards taking out enemy tanks and other vehicles, while the other path is designed to help you repair your friendly vehicles. <strong>Combat Engineer</strong> can be a great pick if you're the one who likes to ride around tanks, as the ability allows vehicles to auto-generate health while you're inside.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Engineer_gadgets">Engineer gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Engineers can choose from a selection of launchers, a supply crate, and a variety of different mines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Engineer_class">Best weapons for Engineer class</h3><p dir="ltr">If you're sticking with the closed-weapons playlist, you'll want to consider the <strong>SGX submachine gun</strong>. The SGX was a standout during the beta, offering a fast rate of fire, high damage, and virtually no recoil with the right attachments.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're playing in the open-weapons playlist, you might want something with better range than a submachine gun can offer. The <strong>NVO-228E assault rifle</strong> is one of the strongest picks for mid-range combat.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Support_class">Support class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581198" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581198"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Support class essentially plays the hero role in Battlefield 6. Support players are the medics, who run into the fight to revive downed teammates and protect their numbers on the map. They also provide their team with supply bags that offer health and ammo. Some game modes are geared toward team life counts, so having good medics on your team can be crucial for the win.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that anyone can revive downed players in Battlefield 6, but no one does it faster and more efficiently than a medic.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Light Machine Guns. Player does not suffer a sprint speed penalty with this weapon type</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Can drag and revive teammates faster</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Supply Bag. Heals allies and resupplies weapon and gadget ammo</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> The supply area of effect around Support player is temporarily increased, as well as the speed at which they revive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Combat Medic: These units are able to function as a health dispensary for allies and also regenerate health when they're reviving teammates</li><li dir="ltr">Fire Support: These combat experts have improved weapon control from mounted positions and can provide ammo to teammates</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. <strong>Fire Support</strong> might be a decent option for you if you're planning on using LMGs for the closed-weapon system, but in most cases the <strong>Combat Medic</strong> is going to be the most powerful choice for really leaning into the role of a medic. Being able to regenerate your health while reviving allies is a nice bonus.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Support_gadgets">Support gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Support players can choose from the Defibrillator paddles for faster revives or deployable cover for helping provide protection to teammates.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Support_class">Best weapons for Support class</h3><p dir="ltr">Let's be honest, the LMGs don't always feel great to use. However, the <strong>L110 light machine gun</strong> can be equipped with some decent attachments to help manage the recoil and increase the damage range.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the signature LMG weapon class, a submachine gun or assault rifle can be a good choice when you're trying to take out enemies to perform a heroic revive. The <strong>SGX submachine gun</strong> or the<strong> M4A1 carbine rifle</strong> could be a good pick.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Recon_class">Recon class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581199" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581199"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Recon class is geared toward stealth, sniping, and gathering helpful intel. Recon players can spot enemies for their teammates and also earn a UAV. Playstyles can vary between posting up on a hillside and sniping away at enemy forces or using stealth to flank and get behind enemy lines. So, you can pick what style caters best to you.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Sniper Rifles. Offers faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope sway, and improved breath control to help stabilize aim for longer</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Automatically spot enemies while aiming through an optic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Motion Sensor. This gadget tracks enemy movement in its range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> Call in a UAV to a marked position for passive spotting of enemies</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Sniper: These long-distance engagement experts have improved auto-spot speed, range, and duration. Sniper shots will highlight enemies and temporarily prevent healing, while headshots will render the struck enemy unable to be revived at all</li><li dir="ltr">Spec Ops: Allows quieter takedowns, crouch, and prone movement. It also allows the player to spot nearby enemy gadgets. Going prone takes the player out of combat much faster and removes the spot on self</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. Which path you choose greatly depends on how you want to play the Recon role. If you want to post up and snipe, then you'll want to choose the <strong>Sniper</strong> training path, while <strong>Spec Ops</strong> is the choice for getting mobile and infiltrating enemy locations with stealth play.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Recon_gadgets">Recon gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Recon players will have access to a recon drone, C-4 explosives, and gadgets geared toward getting intel for their team.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, the Recon class had the Spawn Beacon to provide a dedicated respawn point, but this device was relocated to the Assault class after the beta.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Recon_Class">Best weapons for Recon Class</h3><p dir="ltr">The <strong>M2010 ESR sniper rifle</strong> is the best choice for sniping in the Recon class. You'll need to add some attachments to help boost the gun's damage range and performance, but this is a solid pick for sticking with the signature weapon of the Recon class.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not the most skilled sniper, but you still want something for long-range fights, you can ditch the sniper class for a DMR rifle. The <strong>M39 EMR</strong> and the <strong>SVK-8.6</strong> can both be solid picks for DMR rifles.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/your-%E2%80%98wtf-happened-%E2%80%99-guide-to-all-of-xbox%E2%80%99s-game-pass-changes.1317937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following a whiplash-inducing 50-percent price hike for Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">the Xbox brand overall are in a funky place</a>. That nauseating price increase is likely the loudest adjustment being made to the once-decent Game Pass subscription service, but it’s far from the only one. Old tiers have been overhauled and renamed, with tighter restrictions on when you can access certain games and how many of them you’ll have access to, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">discounts and deals subscribers once enjoyed</a> are but ash scattered to the wind.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">The Enshittification Of Game Pass Is Here</a></p> <p>While the Ultimate plan now has a few more features than it once did, the sting of paying 50 percent extra has caused serious damage to the Xbox brand, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision-merger-2000631611">progressive lawmakers saying “told ya so</a>” after Microsoft gobbled up a bunch of studios and publishers. This is all going down while <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">rumors of an ad-supported version of Xbox Game Streaming</a> are swimming around. That last point shouldn’t be surprising as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-1850987502">Xbox consoles have routinely been home to various ads</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/4i1LCVSdD7k?t=277">taking up your full screen</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consoles/comments/1nw5so9/xbox_consoles_are_now_getting_a_fullscreen_xbox/">on boot</a>.</p>

 <p>As is customary for the first quarter of the 21st century, <a href="https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/">we’re all quoting comrade Doctorow</a> in response to these wild changes. But in case you’re looking to shrug off that late-stage-capitalism ennui with some gaming on Xbox, let’s break down what Game Pass now costs, and how you can still get it for pre-hike prices, for now.</p>

 <h2>How much does Game Pass cost now?</h2> <p>Following last week’s changes, Xbox Game Pass presently offers three tiers:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Essential ($10/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Premium ($15/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Ultimate ($30/month)</li> </ul> <p>All of these tiers let you play online multiplayer on Xbox, though <b>the number of games available and when you get access to them varies</b>. Essential and Premium don’t offer day-one access for new Xbox games. Premium, however, lets you play recently released Xbox titles “within 12 months of launch.” Ultimate (which will run you a ridiculous $360/year if you hang on to your sub all year) grants you the most games with the fastest access: Day-one availability on first- and third-party games, plus all the games in EA Play and Ubisoft+ Classics.</p>

 <p>You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass#join">check out the full details on Xbox’s site</a>, but it’s clear that Game Pass isn’t only more expensive than it once was, it’s also become far more complicated than just throwing a modest sum of money at Microsoft per month to be sure you can play the new <i>Gears</i> or <i>COD</i> at launch.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-game-pass-price-xbox-ally-leak-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-2000631038">GameStop Hits Back At Massive Xbox Game Pass Price Hike</a></p> <p><b>There’s also a PC-only plan for $16.49/month</b> which promises day-one availability of Xbox-published games, as well as some third-party ones. It also includes EA Play.</p>

 <h2>Hang on to Game Pass for Console if ya got it</h2> <p>There’s a select group of Game Pass subscribers who will be happy to know they just dodged a bullet (for now, anyway). As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-console-grandfather-accounts/">confirmed by our comrades over at <i>Polygon</i></a>, if you are presently subscribed to the now-phased-out Game Pass for Console and automatic payment is still set up and functioning, you will be grandfathered in with all of the benefits of the old subscription.</p>

 <p>Should you cancel payments, however, you’ll lose access to that retired plan and will need to choose among the three poison pills of a service Microsoft is selling you. Checking which plan you have is as simple as logging in to Game Pass’ website, clicking on “My Microsoft Account” and checking what active subscriptions you currently have.</p> <h2>GameStop is still selling subs at the older prices (for now)</h2> <p>In an unlikely turn of events, GameStop of all companies has lol’d at Xbox by continuing to sell Ultimate subscriptions for just $20/month. It may be worth checking out other retailers, probably in brick and mortar stores, to see if you can snag a subscription card for a cheaper price as well.</p> <h2>Discounts got the ax. Now it’s all about “Rewards”</h2> <p>One of the cooler things about the Game Pass of Old™ was that you’d regularly get access to exclusive discounts on games and DLC. That’s obviously no longer in Microsoft’s interests to offer you as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead">Microsoft has confirmed to <i>IGN</i></a> that instead of getting a 10-percent discount on DLC, you’ll now just earn more Rewards.</p>

 <p>“Rewards” are a non-Xbox-exclusive program that basically lets you earn money to spend on various Microsoft products. You can earn points otherwise by browsing the web with Bing while using Microsoft Edge (lol what are we doing here, ya’ll?), and now by playing games with an active Game Pass subscription.</p> <p>If that sounds confusing, I regret to inform you that it’s probably that way by design. Essential will net you up to $25 in rewards per year, Premium allows for up to $50, and Ultimate will let you earn up to $100. You can read all of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards/about">nitty gritty details about the Microsoft Rewards program here</a>.</p>

 <h2>What are other gaming subscription services charging?</h2> <p>Pricier subs, the death of discounts, it all sounds painful and it is! That might have you wondering what’s going on with other subscription services, especially if you value an ongoing service over just straight-up purchasing and owning your games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions">PlayStation has a similar three-tier structure</a> (no options for PC gamers though). The most costly version of these will only cost you $160 for the full year, which is a full $200 less than what Xbox is charging for Ultimate. The most basic version of its subscription service will only cost you $80/year, but it doesn’t come with a game catalog. You’ll need to buy the middle-tier option at a minimum for that, which will run you $15/month or $135/year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/">Nintendo has two subscription services</a> but doesn’t offer any Switch games via a Netflix-style, download-on-demand service. Its most basic service costs $20/year, lets you play online among other benefits, and lets you play from a library of NES, SNES, and Game Boy games whenever you want. At $50/year, a pricier tier expands that retro library to include select GameCube, GBA, N64, and Sega Genesis games (yes, really!).</p>

 <h2>A reminder: No company can increase the cost of games you fully ‘own’</h2> <p>I put ‘own’ in quotes there because, especially on PC, there’s debate as to whether or not our Steam libraries (or any digital library) is made up of the games themselves, or is just a collection of licenses granting us access to the games. (There’s always GOG if you want to be sure you’ll just get straight up .exe files of your games, though it is a more limited collection.) But that argument aside, if you plunk down $60-70 bucks to snag a new game that doesn’t have a perpetual monetization scheme baked into it, you will continue to have access to that game without needing a corporation to charge you every month.</p> <p>Maybe you’ll have a smaller library of games available to you at any given moment, but at least they’ll be yours. Period. Consider it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">Xbox Still Swears It’s Not Giving Up On Console As Fan Morale Craters</a></p> <p>Subscriptions make sense for many folks, no doubt. But having direct access to your games keeps you away from these kinds of shenanigans, and I shudder to think there’s a generation of gamers growing up right now that think more about getting an Ultimate Game Pass card for their birthdays or holidays than an actual copy, digital or physical, of a game that they’ll own for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Coming 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Revolution Software has unveiled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_the_smoking_mirror_reforged">Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</a>, an enhanced rerelease of the second game in the Broken Sword series. And it's coming to Switch, alongside other platforms, in early 2026.</p>
<p>Originally teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/broken-sword-reforged-team-teases-another-remaster-might-be-on-the-cards">much earlier this year</a>, The Smoking Mirror appropriately follows on from the excellent 2024 enhanced release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a> and brings with it the same bells and whistles. Though it <em>is</em> getting a 4K release this time — perhaps a free patch for Switch 2 owners, then? We hope so...</p>
<p>The Smoking Mirror is perhaps equally as beloved as the first game, so we're sure fans are extremely excited to dive into this rerelease. Plus, for those who want an extra dose of nostalgia, you can swap between the 1997 visuals and the new 'reforged' ones here, too.</p>
<p>Taking place six months after Shadow of the Templars, George Stobbart reunites with his friend Nico Collard in Paris; she's been researching Mayan history after receiving a Mayan stone tablet. But this path takes the pair on the road to unravelling a deadly conspiracy, all across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America.</p>


<p>Not only will you be able to swap between the old and new visuals, but you'll once again have the chance to play 'traditional mode', where puzzles are harder, or a 'story mode' if you need a few hints along the way.</p>
<p>Right now, we've got to wait until next year to get our hands on The Smoking Mirror, but if you haven't checked out Shadow of the Templars, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">we highly recommend it</a>.</p>

<p>Have you played The Smoking Mirror before? Will you be getting this on Switch in 2026? Let us know in the comments<em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no secret that PC gaming is constantly evolving, with more developers focusing on it as their platform of choice and technological advancements allowing them to make games that look and run at a level that would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, IGN sat down with NVIDIA and CD Projekt Red to chat about the current state of PC gaming, the games that best showcase the latest tech advancements, and the challenges and opportunities that could help define the future of PC gaming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NVIDIA introduced a host of advancements earlier this year, starting with the launch of DLSS 4 alongside its GeForce RTX 50-Series hardware, which uses AI-powered rendering to enhance visuals and  improve performance. It offers improved image quality, overcomes anti-aliasing limitations, and its Ray Reconstruction uses AI to reduce ray-traced noise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also adds improved Frame Generation and Multi-Frame Generation, which enable performance and graphics features that weren’t possible previously. They overcome CPU bottlenecks, allowing path tracing at over 200+ FPS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Frame Generation uses AI to generate an entire frame based on data from the game itself,” GeForce Evangelist Jacob Freeman said. “We introduced that with DLSS 3, and it generated one additional frame. For DLSS 4, it’s generating three additional frames. So you’re getting much smoother gameplay, much higher performance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lighting might be the area of game development that has seen the biggest improvement in recent years, first with the proliferation of Ray Tracing. DLSS 4 allows developers to utilize Path Tracing, which can be used to create photorealistic 3D environments with dynamic light and shadow, reflections, and refractions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[Path Tracing] is not necessarily a new technology. I mean, it’s been used in CG for a long time,” Freeman said. “But until recently, it was basically unachievable for real-time graphics. It’s just too computationally intensive. Basically, DLSS helped us to deliver path-traced visuals at a full 60 FPS.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Path Tracing enhances lighting across the board, taking the quality of ray-traced lighting to the next level, reflecting additional detail and game elements on surfaces. It provides more realistic illumination, and light bounces off multiple surfaces, creating more detailed and varied environments. One of the benchmark implementations of Path Tracing came in the Phantom Liberty expansion for Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do need to say with great pride that we were one of the frontrunners when it comes to Path Tracing, and we worked with NVIDIA for years,” said Jakub Knapik, VP/Global Art Director for CD Projekt Red. “We started with Ray Tracing in our base game. The decision to release Path Tracing was actually triggered by the fact that DLSS was capable of what it was capable of. And while we released Phantom Liberty, it was more or less the same time where DLSS evolved.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt Red has continued working closely with NVIDIA to implement more improvements, with Cyberpunk 2077 adding DLSS 4 support with Multi-Frame Generation in January. It works in concert with DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Ray Reconstruction to multiply performance on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs by 9.2x on average at 4K with the fully ray-traced RT Overdrive Mode enabled and all settings maxed out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With all those features [of DLSS 4], we were able to have, for example, Path Tracing running in Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty in 4K,” Knapik said. “When you just process that, the one frame with Path Tracing in a film 10 years ago required 24 hours to render. One frame. Now we are rendering 240 frames in 4K to play the game. Obviously we’re using a lot of tricks, but when you just flip in your head the math … this is a breakthrough.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Cyberpunk 2077 is an excellent example of the tech’s implementation, there are plenty of other standout games that showcase what’s possible with DLSS 4 and Path Tracing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages had its frame rates multiplied on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs by an average of 4x at 4K using DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation. Its performance doubled on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs using DLSS Frame Generation, and image quality and frame rates were enhanced on all GeForce RTX GPUs using DLSS Super Resolution’s transformer AI Model. Path Tracing also enhances light sources, such as lamps, torches, and the Doom Slayer’s weapons. These emissive elements now more realistically illuminate surrounding detail, and dynamically illuminate corridors as light from emissives hits shiny, specular surfaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is also enhanced with DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Path Tracing. Using DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation, it can reach previously unobtainable frame rates on RTX 50 Series graphics cards. With Path Tracing, shadows, reflections, and global illumination are all accurately rendered, elevating image quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy Entertainment’s FBC: Firebreak features the full suite of RTX technology that was developed for Alan Wake 2 (also from Remedy). FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS, showing that DLSS improvements can be implemented in a wide range of genres. Lighting reflections, shadows, and ambient occlusion are all enhanced with Path Tracing. This improves fidelity throughout the Federal Bureau of Control’s unpredictable and extradimensional headquarters, including transparent and opaque reflections accurately mirroring their surroundings at full resolution, heightening immersion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the upcoming action RPG Phantom Blade Zero from developer S-GAME has committed to launching with day-one support for DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation, along with Ray Tracing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of future titles, Freeman and Knapik discussed where the industry is heading and what challenges are next to be tackled. They both mentioned hair being an area of focus, particularly in how it reacts to light and making it look and behave more realistically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s also more advanced ray tracing that can still be done. For example, we recently talked about a new feature called RTX Hair, which is a more accurate way to represent how light interacts with hair,” Freeman said. “With RTX Hair, it’s using a new feature on RTX 50 series that is called linear swept spheres and it’s a different way to actually render the hair strands. It’s a more efficient way to render the hair strands, which can interact better with path-traced lighting. What it will allow you to do is just have more realistic-looking hair when you light it with Path Tracing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Freeman also mentioned neural rendering being the wave of the future. That started earlier this year with the release of NVIDIA RTX Kit, which is a suite of neural rendering technologies to use AI for ray tracing, render scenes with immense geometry, and create more lifelike characters. It enhances geometry, textures, materials, and lighting, providing greater visual fidelity and performance for complex open worlds while reducing artifacts, instability, and VRAM usage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While next-generation technologies like DLSS and Path Tracing are becoming more standard in games, the experts at NVIDIA and developers at CD Projekt Red and other leading studios are constantly pushing to find new ways to leverage technologies to improve graphics and performance, giving PC gamers the best experience possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s certainly a lot more that can be done with lighting, with Path Tracing, with Ray Tracing, that we still have to explore,” Freeman said. “There’s always places to go.”</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-and-cd-projekt-red-discuss-the-present-and-future-of-pc-gaming]]></content:encoded>
