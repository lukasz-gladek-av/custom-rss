                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fading-echo/" data-ref-id="5000-681533">Fading Echo</a> has caught my eye for a few reasons: its desert punk setting, fast-paced and fluid-looking combat, and its mixture of both Japanese manga and American comics for its visuals. French developer New Tales' debut title is an impressive-looking action-adventure game, but what has most surprised me about it is seeing so many names attached to it that I recognize from the tabletop industry. But as it happens, that's no coincidence--from the very beginning, Fading Echo has had a connection to TTRPGs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Before joining the video game industry, I used to work in the TTRPG industry," New Tales co-founder and Fading Echo co-director Emmanuel Obert told me. "So eight or 10 years ago--something like that--I created a TTRPG setting for a group of friends [that] I met in the '90s and 2000s in the TTRPG space."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eulglZW-W0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eulglZW-W0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">He continued: "At some point each of us was a Dungeon Master for [our home games] and when a campaign was done, it would switch to another Game Master. So when my turn came, I was a big fan--and am still a big fan--of the Chronicles of Amber, but it's hard to play in worlds that are super well set. It's hard to move stuff around. And it's a diceless system. Some people in the TTRPG [space] hate systems [like that]. And so then I thought, 'Okay, let's take some inspiration from that [instead]. Let's build something [new].'"</p><p dir="ltr">The original idea of that setting, homebrewed to work with the Marvel Heroic Cortex Plus system, is what would eventually become Fading Echo. When Obert and his fellow co-founders first started New Tales three and a half years ago, they wanted to make games, not just publish them. But they didn't have access to any existing IP or ideas for their own. So Obert pitched the fantasy world he had made for his friends years prior--the team thought it had "potential" according to Obert, and aspects of it were adjusted to make the setting their own. But aspects of the original world remain in Fading Echo. "The legends that we have in Fading Echo, it's very much our version of a Princess of Amber," Obert said.</p><p dir="ltr">Lore-wise, Fading Echo takes place on Corel, a lost world discovered by House Kelevra (of which protagonist One and her mother, Rahne, are a part). With advanced machinery and liquid magic, Kelevra attempted to colonize the planet, but their overly aggressive efforts fractured the Corel and doomed those who came to call it home.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529010-ss_803c26d0c31089a12a8b61658a12669d74e54db3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529010-ss_803c26d0c31089a12a8b61658a12669d74e54db3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529010"></a><figcaption>You can temporarily create platforms over lava by pushing a wave of water through it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529010-ss_803c26d0c31089a12a8b61658a12669d74e54db3.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To showcase how the planet is fighting back against those seeking to tame it, Fading Echo's world is built around systemic depth to encourage player expression in combat and traversal, or when interacting with elemental forces, like lava or pollution.</p><p dir="ltr">"Water [is] the mana of the game," studio head Sylvain Sechi told me. "And then we expanded this concept of playing with fluid--not only water but also other fluids like lava, like waste, like corrosion. Each fluid has an elementary reaction when they are affected by each other. So we really pushed for this concept of fluids and how fluids interact with each other--how you can be a fluid and leave fluids behind you. And then we decided to push forward and say, 'Okay, what if our enemies are also made of fluids?'"</p><p dir="ltr">He continued: "And that's how the action of the game was created. We were not even seeing combat back then. We were thinking about the global systemic action where what we're trying to achieve is create systems that make the player feel smart. Basically you can anticipate which kind of fluids will react toward each other. Some are pretty easy--you can guess water and lava are going to solidify and create a rocky platform which you can jump on top of. So for combat, there is never one solution. [It's all about] systemic interaction--[what] can I create by combining fluids or by using fluids that are in their environment or [by] using my own fluids. And if you're smart, some combat [encounters] can be pretty easy. And at the end of the day, if you run out of fluids or you do not think of some smart interaction [that you can] do, you can always hack and slash with your spear."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529011-ss_f6c93bcd9b6a14164bc90575c5def2bfc1608b07.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529011" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529011-ss_f6c93bcd9b6a14164bc90575c5def2bfc1608b07.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529011"></a><figcaption>One transforms into a ball of steam if she touches lava while as a water droplet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529011-ss_f6c93bcd9b6a14164bc90575c5def2bfc1608b07.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Generally, the reason people play TTRPGs is because it's a game system that allows you to have an urgency and an autonomy of choice that is [rarely] seen in any other games," Sechi said. "Especially [when there's] a dice system, [which can] go pretty crazy. And this feeling of freedom in a game system is something we love. And we tried to recreate [that feeling]."</p><p dir="ltr">From that TTRPG-inspired baseline, it was a hop, skip, and a jump for the New Tales team to seek input from other tabletop voices. Critical Role's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2233310/" rel="nofollow ">Matthew Mercer</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1154161/" rel="nofollow ">Laura Bailey</a> now voice major characters in the game, game master and actor Jasmine Bhullar (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4rYvwLCVUc">DesiQuest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul8iK77Cl-k">Coffin Run</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtLcWpD16Uo">Battle for Beyond</a>) joined the team as the writer (and voice of Rahne!), and actor Samantha BÃ©art (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow/" data-ref-id="5000-569367">The Excavation of Hob's Barrow</a>) was cast as One. You may not roll dice or build decks in Fading Echo, but a lot of people who love tabletop roleplaying games have had a hand in shaping what this game is.</p><p dir="ltr">"We met Jasmine because we were all French peeps [and we knew we wanted Fading Echo] to be an Echoverse, [a] multiverse--it needs to talk to a large number of people," Obert said. "And then at the same time, we said, 'Okay, let's try to get some of the Critical Role peeps.' We harassed them every day. At some point, they agreed and probably said, 'Just stop contacting us.' [laughs] I'm joking. We were super lucky to get them. And Samantha--it was a super funny story when we met them in London. I think we were both trying to impress each other."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529012-ss_f1b5f2b25a41b8f1a827496c7fa128972ac55d31.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529012-ss_f1b5f2b25a41b8f1a827496c7fa128972ac55d31.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529012"></a><figcaption>She's just a little guy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529012-ss_f1b5f2b25a41b8f1a827496c7fa128972ac55d31.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">BÃ©art was cast as One, a would-be hero on a quest to discover who she is and how she might save her home, the floating islands of Corel. One can wield the power of water, summoning waves and creating thunderous effects. She can also transform into a cute water droplet-looking slime that can traverse tiny cavities, dive into water to slither beneath enemies or obstacles, and descend onto enemies with an explosive splash.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have actually played a bit of the game," BÃ©art told me. "[New Tales has] given me a Steam key. [Which is] perfect. The worst thing [for an actor] is when [the game] comes out and you go, 'Oh, I would've done that so differently if I'd known that's what it would've played like.'"</p><p dir="ltr">BÃ©art told me that having a chance to play the game and see One in action has already helped them better prepare for the role, pointing out the symbol on One's head matching her "face" when she's a water droplet. It was a detail that I didn't originally notice--it's small--but it unifies One's character. As a humanoid warrior, One is drawn with rigid angles and rough edges, akin to characters from US comic books back in the day. But as a droplet, she transitions art styles, gaining a rounder and more cutesy aesthetic that one might expect in a Japanese manga. I went into my conversation with BÃ©art theorizing that both forms had radically different personalities or voices to bring attention to the two forms in one body. But BÃ©art said that they reached a different conclusion after playing the game--those triangle symbols positioned like a smiling face exist in both of One's forms, representing a constant to characterize her.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529013-ss_1d47e385e3dc37d49eccbf15883ed5c67c5a050d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529013" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529013-ss_1d47e385e3dc37d49eccbf15883ed5c67c5a050d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529013"></a><figcaption>In other realities, One's appearance transforms.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529013-ss_1d47e385e3dc37d49eccbf15883ed5c67c5a050d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That [expression/symbol] is obviously the core of who she is--that's what it says to me," BÃ©art said. "[It is] lovely to play someone who isn't destruction and fire [in a] video game. As the protagonist, you tend to smash things up, but water is an element I've never explored in this medium, so that's really, really, really exciting to me to see what we can do with that exactly."</p><p dir="ltr">BÃ©art has had a major impact in shaping One. The way they described building the character alongside the developers and being welcomed to interact with the team sounded closer to what's typically reserved to select actors in film or television or theater, not video games. "It is just nice to have that deep knowledge before you can even get started," BÃ©art said. "There was no NDA [and I] still managed not to upset them by spilling a secret. Crazy, isn't it? You don't have to threaten us with a document. I was in the Discord. I can see what everyone's doing."</p><p dir="ltr">They continued: "It sort of reminds me of early days of Lucasfilm where they had everyone in this big warehouse and you could go over and see what props were doing and props could go and talk to the script writers and they could talk to the cinematographer and everyone was [working together]. It's true collaboration rather than the siloed way the games [industry] tends to work. I think it's a small miracle each game gets made. It's difficult, what [studios] are doing. And when the actor understands that, that really helps us in our relations to the developers."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529014-ss_6d30b0995a0d2fa310cdfc3ff425533587e3c614.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529014-ss_6d30b0995a0d2fa310cdfc3ff425533587e3c614.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529014"></a><figcaption>One's mana system is water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529014-ss_6d30b0995a0d2fa310cdfc3ff425533587e3c614.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Comparing their time with the work they did for Karlach, BÃ©art said, "[In] Baldur's Gate [3], [the actors] didn't technically meet until after the game, or if you came out for a break and bumped into each other. I haven't recorded [for Fading Echo] yet. So the plan is to have a table read with the others. So I imagine there'll be some chemistry tests and there might be some tweaking depending on how those are read, which is again, unheard of in video games--actually, I say that, but I think Blizzard actually does that. I think Blizzard are one of the few that actually do that. [New Tales] takes away some of the best of what they've experienced in this [industry]."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd like to see this more often in games, because we do it in film and TV and theater," BÃ©art said. "Recently, in the marketing part of it, the actor has been a nice extra to have--something to plug in at the end as opposed to [being an] integral [part]. We're certainly an asset to your marketing campaign. Fans will connect with us. If [your game] is played for narrative, they will connect with the actors. It's kind of obvious. It's why film actors do junkets. But also they might be stuck with me for some time. They want to feel me out, see if I'm okay. [Which is] very smart. What if I turned out to be a nightmare or I was a bigot or otherwise my values don't line up with theirs? They'd be in real trouble."</p><p dir="ltr">And BÃ©art very well could be attached to this team for a while. Though this outcome primarily rides on Fading Echo's reception and success, there seems to be an implication that this is merely the first game in series that will tackle a multiverse of locations. Within the narrative of Fading Echo, One exists in an Echoverse of realities, and you'll traverse a few of them in the game--as seen in the reveal trailer, One travels from her primarily desert reality to one that's entirely underwater at one point.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529015-ss_75f9c38ce293a13ef2e49ad04fc276e8e4250a96.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529015" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529015-ss_75f9c38ce293a13ef2e49ad04fc276e8e4250a96.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529015"></a><figcaption>One can leave a trail of fluid behind in her droplet form, like a slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529015-ss_75f9c38ce293a13ef2e49ad04fc276e8e4250a96.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Within the Echoverse, there are specific prime realities that act as starting points from which variable realities, known as mirrored realities or Shadows, can spawn. Corel is a prime reality that is rich in resources when it's first discovered, and since it is untouched, there are no variable realities to consider. House Kelevra sees this as an opportunity: They can shape Corel however they want, manipulating it to birth the type of realities that they want. As a result, Corel's various Shadows are reflections of House Kelevra's exploitation more than anything else, providing insight into the crimes and awful actions performed by One's house. As One goes on her journey, she is plunged into places that are familiar, but substantially different based on a twisted choice made by someone else.</p><p dir="ltr">Going to other universes and living foreign experiences is also part of why New Tales turned to Bhullar. "So I think [pulling from other industries] gives us some opportunities that we would never see or never think about [normally]," Obert said. "[We're a French studio] working with a writer born in the US who's an Indian person that lives in the US--they have a [different] way of building up a character or building story or writing dialogues [than we do]. We are not able to do that on our own--it's impossible. You need to have those diverse perspectives to do what you don't know, especially if you want to create a multiverse--you need as many people who think in different ways as possible."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529016-ss_468af35cfbcd364b7d8868cf185d2c00d6f002bb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529016" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529016-ss_468af35cfbcd364b7d8868cf185d2c00d6f002bb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529016"></a><figcaption>The pursuit of Ã¦ther has damaged the world of Corel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529016-ss_468af35cfbcd364b7d8868cf185d2c00d6f002bb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">He continued: "We like the idea of having some people that come from the same craft but from a different industry and bring something very different. And Jasmine never worked on or wrote for a video game before. And I think she's bringing something super fresh and super new to it and getting a fresh vibe."</p><p dir="ltr">"Our composer didn't come from video games [and] our cinematic team don't come from video games, so it's a bit harder to integrate [their talents] at the beginning, but they bring creative DNA to our source that makes it unique and special," Sechi added. "It's enabling creativity and empowering innovation."</p><p dir="ltr">All of which is to say: Fading Echo sounds like it's going to be a pretty cool game, and I can't wait to try it out. The action-adventure game is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. No release window has been announced yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> VP. Dan Ayoub has replaced Jess Lanzillo as the VP of Franchise for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG. With this change in management comes a new shift in business, specifically to a "franchise model."</p>



<p>Dan Ayoub announced his new position as&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> VP via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348517655173054464/" rel="nofollow">a LinkedIn</a> post. In the post, Ayoub expresses his love and passion for Wizards of the Coast's enduring fantasy franchise, mentioning he's been playing since he was 12 years old. The second half of the post explains that the internal structure of <em>D&amp;D</em> will shift into what he refers to as a "full franchise model."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The impact here cannot be overstated; this is massive for D&amp;D and will allow a strong, coordinated, and well-funded approach for the franchise, and most importantly, for us, the fans.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, thanks to some digging by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/dungeons-dragons-shifts-to-franchise-model-dan-ayoub-named-as-head.714236/" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Ayoub's experience comes from the videogame industry. He has spent 11 years at Microsoft, notably as Studio Head and Executive Producer of 343 Industries. This means he had a noticeable influence on the post-Bungie era of<em> Halo</em>. In addition, he has been an executive producer at Ubisoft and as a Game Director for Disney.</p>

<p>Regardless of the state of those institutions under Ayoub, it is difficult to tell how the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> VP's franchise model will affect things going forward. Part of the longevity of <em>D&amp;D</em> has come from it being such large, recognizable, malleable franchise in its current form.</p>

<p>On the consumer-facing side, there is already a plethora of different <em>D&amp;D</em> products available. The critically acclaimed video game of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>. The entertaining <em>D&amp;D</em> movie, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Honor Among Thieves</em></a>.&nbsp;There are even new novels being published like <em>Ravenloft: Heir of Strahd</em>. As such, this model change may not be too noticeable.</p>

<p>As for the business side of things, it does mark a considerable shift in attitude by WIzards of the Coast. Considering Ayoub is filling in a gap of high-profile departures from the company, which include Lanzillo, Todd Kenrick, and lead designers <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-welcomes-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-darrington-press" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Perkins and Jeremy Crawford</a>, this change in direction may potentially be a means to consolidate their workforce from different departments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Y'know, if you're okay breaking the game</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're familiar with some of the glitches possible in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, then you're probably already aware of 'MsgNotFound'. It's essentially the Master Sword from the prologue section of the game, and it's quite possibly the best unbreakable weapon you can get.</p>
<p><em>If</em> you can get it, mind. And now, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrkuO5Y-Z2I">Gaming Reinvented</a>, it's easier than ever. You'll need a copy of Tears of the Kingdom: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition first and foremost, since you'll need to make use of the Zelda Notes app. Here's a look at all of the prerequisites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- The Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom<br>
- Nintendo Switch App with Zelda Notes<br>
- Autobuild (can be obtained before the first Kohga battle)<br>
- At least one weapon you donât mind losing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you're sorted, be sure to check out Gaming Reinvented's video for the full step-by-step guide (plus the <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/walkthrough/how-to-easily-keep-the-msgnotfound/">site page</a> for the relevant Zelda Notes QR code). There's also a bit more information available if you'd like to Fuse the weapon and make it even more powerful.</p>
<p>So if you're okay with essentially breaking the game and nabbing a weapon that really ain't meant to be there, then do give this a try. Chances are Nintendo will probably patch it out soon, anyway.</p>

Speaking about the <em>Ironheart</em> series premiere, Downey praised the episodeâs ability to introduce a new character in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602">Riri Williams</a></span> while quickly establishing the impetus of her journey, developing the supporting cast, and complicating the showâs emotional core by giving her a dead friend as her AI sidekick. To the most important actor in the history of the MCU, Thorne ran âthe whole gamut of an MCU film in 40 minutes.â</p><p>Heâs not wrong.

In the first episode alone, the show explores the worldâs obsession with iron suits after Tony Starkâs death, centers the Iron Man legacy on intelligence rather than money by having Riri build a suit out of scrap metal, and uses childhood trauma to justify the creation of her AI assistant. Each of those story beats couldâve been entire episodes on lesser Marvel series.</p><p>Beyond his love of the showâs storytelling, Downey also explained how Tony Stark and Riri Williams are âtwin flames.â It all begins with the heart. Tony Starkâs journey starts in <em>Iron Man</em> after one of his weapons explodes and a piece of shrapnel gets dangerously close to his heart. That injuryâand Ho Yinsen (Shaun Toub) using an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heartâinspires the creation of the arc reactor, Starkâs most important invention. Ririâs heart is physically intact when her <em>Ironheart</em> journey begins, but Downey sees a philosophical connection between their origin stories.</p><p>âIn this iteration, the heart is not only [about] going home, but also this disparity and inequity, and knowing she can only do as much as she can do.â</p><p>When this video was shot, heâd only watched the first three episodes of the show and he hints at a second conversation between the two that will take place after he finishes the series. Letâs all hope we get more intergenerational chats to push the superhero genre forward.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-ironheart-iron-man-mcu-disney-plus-1851785928]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Blitz Royale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735">will be sticking around</a> past its previously announced expiration date, but it turns out that extension will bring some big changes, too. Like how, starting next week, the tiny Blitz island will be the new home of Mega City, that skyscraper-filled town that sat at the center of Fortnite's Battle Royale island for most of Chapter 4. Blitz Royale's first big update will happen on July 15. Mega City will reportedly take over the spot <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1942978180891189610" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">where Retail Row currently sits</a>.</p><p>So Epic isn't just extending Blitz Royale as is--instead, it's continuing as it has been with a new set of themed loot pools, with a continued focus on collaboration items, like this week's TMNT melee-fest. While the teaser refers to the collabs as a "surprise," <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1942947410650575314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers believe</a> three of the weeks will center on Jujutsu Kaisen, Dragon Ball, and Mortal Kombat. Blitz will also clearly incorporate other weapons from standard Battle Royale as well, like the gloves that shoot birds that were introduced earlier this season.</p><p>Blitz Royale, with its focus on fast matchmaking and creating an experience that's palatable for mobile players, was immediately a hit when it launched in the middle of June, briefly serving as Fortnite's most popular mode. Player counts have fallen off somewhat since then, but Blitz still stands solidly in third place behind Battle Royale/Zero Build and Reload. And it's <em>well</em> ahead of the fourth place Fortnite OG. So it's no surprise at all that Epic would want to keep Blitz Royale going.</p><p>Before we dive into this updated version of Blitz, however--the new Superman skin, available on the current battle pass, will finally be earnable starting on Friday. Word is that he's bringing some other folks from the new Superman film to the item shop, like <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1942949864268001521" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mister Terrific and the Engineer</a>.</p>

                <p>As the games industry struggles to compete against other entertainment, as well as its own free-to-play sector, for people's time and money, games marketing analyst Chris Zukowski posits that developers' saving grace is Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/06/03/most-people-who-buy-your-game-wont-play-it/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/valve-cracked-the-problem-that-netflix-was-struggling-with-using-diehard-gamers-and-their-backlogs-steam-expert-says-you-get-access-to-a-bunch-of-drunken-sailors-who-spend-money-irresponsibly/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>), Zukowski argues that Valve has cracked the problem that other entertainment services like Netflix have where success is measured by the time consumers are engaging with content. That is because gamers aren't just consumers, but collectors.</p><p dir="ltr">"The power of Steam as a platform is that it enables hoarding," he writes, comparing gaming with other hobbies--whether that is Lego, Warhammer, or knitting--that is made up a diehard audience that are "very interested in a subject and doesnât worry about how much money they are spending on it."</p><p dir="ltr">Zukowski further digs into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-defends-30-steam-cut-in-antitrust-suit/1100-6494600/">Valve's 30% revenue cut</a> from Steam sales, which has attracted criticism. He however claims that the reason developers are willing to hand over such a high cut to Valve is because they're getting revenue whether or not their audience actually plays their game: "Knowing Steam players are hoarders explains why you give them that 30%: You get access to a bunch of drunken sailors who spend money irresponsibly."</p><p dir="ltr">Developers may take comfort in this analysis when competing against older live-service games like Fortnite and GTA Online that continue to be the biggest games, even if that means their revenue is coming from games that may never be played.</p><p dir="ltr">"Donât be discouraged by that! This is totally normal for Steam," Zukowski continues. "If Steam shoppers were rational and only bought games they were going to play, we would sell a lot fewer games. Half this industry would be gone."</p><p dir="ltr">He does have a caveat for this theory, in that it applies more to games with a "very clear genre." "If players can look at your game in a glance and figure out the genre, they are more likely to impulse buy because they say, 'Ah, I love open world survival-crafting games! I know this! I am definitely going to play this once I am finished with the other 20 OWSC games in my collection.' If your genre is ambiguous, you wonât be picked up by hoarders."</p><p>If that's got you thinking of hoarding your collection, then the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-summer-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-6667/#2">Steam Summer Sale</a> is still currently on.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ff4336e3766eb/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been on the circuit for over a month now, and after a decade of its predecessor, it's great to be playing something that feels fresh.</p>
<p>That's not to say all of its innovations have gone down well, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">a vocal contingent of players</a> taking against Nintendo's updates and approach to Grand Prix mode, with the 'intermission' routes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fans-reckon-nintendo-has-killed-mario-kart-world-with-its-latest-update">drawing particular ire</a> from people who prefer the traditional three-lap race-around-a-circuit.</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-mario-kart-world-speeds-past-1-million-physical-sales">the sales numbers</a>, it's safe to say that Nintendo will be supporting this one for a while. And given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">the furore</a> around its eyewatering $80 price tag, we don't imagine there'll be paid DLC coming for a long while. We <em>do</em> imagine free updates that include not just minor tweaks but perhaps additional features, modes, costumes, and maybe even new characters.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what's at the top of Team NL's wishlist...</p>
<h2>Waypoint the way - Ollie Reynolds, staff writer</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dae5c4f66fc5d/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the recent controversy around the apparent lack of traditional three-lap races, I think it's only sensible that Nintendo introduces a bit more customisation when it comes to choosing <em>how</em> we race. So yes, let's see <strong>a 'Classic Grand Prix' mode</strong> that just allows us to jump from one track to the next for those familiar, comforting three-lap bouts.</p>
<p>Don't stop there, though. Why not let us completely <strong>customise our own Knockout race</strong> by choosing any four tracks from the map? It could make for some truly unique races! If that's not enough, I think it would be neat if you could select your own start and end waypoints from any point on the map, incorporating any track that happens to fall in between.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Mario Kart World holds massive potential that, at the moment, I feel is being held back somewhat. Nintendo needs to unshackle World from its Chain Chomp.</p>

<p>If you've avidly read everything Mario Kart World on Nintendo Life, you probably know Jim and I have been responsible for putting most of the guides together. So, um, it won't surprise you all that I really, <em>really</em> could've done with a map marker, Nintendo.</p>
<p><strong>A mix of ways to track your collectibles or mark a location on the map</strong> would've been a godsend, but it also would've allowed me to remember places that are perfect for snapping photos or messing around with friends. I admittedly love stumbling across things on the map, but there were times when I was trying to do something else, like chase a Nabbit or attempt a P Switch.</p>
<p>On that subject, if you're going to give us stickers, <strong>let us put more than one sticker on our vehicles</strong>. What's the point in a cute little reward if they're barely noticeable?</p>
<p>Lastly, for something a bit more left-field (and to echo Ollie), how about a design-your-own Knockout Tour? I am thinking <em>waaaay</em> out of the box here, I know, but imagine how cool it would be to actually choose your routes between courses.</p>

<p>I have been thoroughly enjoying MKW. My friends have also been enjoying it, from what I understand. So why, oh why, can it sometimes feel like such a headache trying to play <em>with</em> them?</p>
<p><strong>Local multiplayer Free Roam</strong> feels like the lowest-hanging fruit here (it sure would have made finding all those P Switches a lot easier), and while there is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-play-free-roam#can-i-play-free-roam-in-split-screen"><em>some</em> semblance of a workaround</a>, it ain't the full-fat experience I'm after.</p>
<p>Even if Free Roam is off the table, can we at least have it so I can <strong>add friends to pre-existing online lobbies</strong>? If I'm playing with one group and then the lovely Felix-from-Nintendo-Life-here pops up online, there's currently no way for me to add him to my lobby so we can all play together. Oh no. Instead, I've got to clear everyone out and start all over again with a fresh room. God forbid I do all of that only for Zion-from-Nintendo-Life-here to come online after a race or two...</p>
<p>I'll be willing to forget all of the above, however, if my beloved <strong>Koopalings</strong> were to rejoin the roster. I miss Roy.</p>

<p>As Jim has brought up the roster, <strong>Kid Pauline</strong> from the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">DK Bananza</a> feels like a no-brainer addition to the roster. Both DK and his muse are light in the costume department, too, and given the multitude of unlockable get-ups in Bananza, slipping <strong>more outfits</strong> (and therefore more food?) into MKW makes eminent sense. Who <em>doesn't</em> want Vegas Jumpsuit Waluigi?</p>
<p>Back on the subject of DKB, after reading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">the preview coverage</a> and considering potential lore implications of a teenage Pauline on the hallowed and very much canonical Mario/DK timeline (you just know Nintendo's got a doc somewhere), it's got me thinking about <strong>teenage versions of other Mushroom Kingdom residents</strong>. We've had the babies, now it's time for the t(w)eens. Yes, you heard it here first: this is the <em>real</em> reason Nintendo gave <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-charles-martinet-made-gamings-greatest-accident-a-real-character">Charles Martinet</a> his P45. He just wasn't quite able to nail Squeaky-Voiced Teen Mario.</p>
<p>Am I 100% serious? Perhaps 50%, but I <em>would</em> enjoy seeing what Nintendo's artists did with a 'Waluigi-but-a-teenager' brief. If they're scraping the Mushroom Kingdom barrel (hey, I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-unlock-all-characters#top-30">Conkdor</a> as much as the next man, but c'mon!) and they're holding back the Links and Inklings and wider Nintendo universe characters for some reason, sure, give me Peach with a pimple. Give me edgy, emo Toad. Show me Wario before he went off the rails.</p>

<p>Oh, and <strong>200cc</strong>, I suppose. Preferably with an obscure unlock method involving rune symbols drawn in Mouse Mode and getting three-star golds in every online Knockout Tour by reversing over each checkpoint line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software aims to improve upon the series' predecessors in all regards, including the endgame portion. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/07/creative-director-discusses-designing-the-very-ambitious-endgame-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Game Informer</a>, Creative Director Graeme Timmins explained:</p>



<p><em>I care about it a lot personally, as my role on Borderlands 3 was curating what became the endgame for that. I know what's important to our community, and that's built already into the game. Like, we made purposeful decisions with our Action Skill tree, assuming what will come in the future with our endgame. It's not a secret that we always eventually do level-cap increases, right? That's built into the high-level design of saying, 'Okay, if that's going to still be in our future, how can we make our Action Skill tree this time anticipate that and be balanced from the jump.</em></p>



<p><em>In Borderlands 3, we ended at 72 skill points. It's a really high number, right? And so, for the game designer in me, that can create a lot of chaos with how those Action Skills were designed. You lose build diversity as you add more skill points because everyone's homogeneous, because they all have the same skills ultimately unlocked. We've thought about Borderlands 4's endgame from the jump, and we have some great plans for it that we're going to share, but I think we're taking a lot of the lessons from both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and Borderlands to make sure that we execute the best version of the endgame yet for Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>If it succeeds, Borderlands 4 could be a very long lived game, as the endgame is what can really keep players coming to it. We'll see after launch, which isn't far at all, especially after Gearbox brought the launch date forward <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from September 23 to September 12</a>, much to the excitement of fans.</p>

            <p>Of all the "what if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but" projects on offer, there are surely none so atrocious and indecent, so utterly irresponsible of conception and offensive to human dignity as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdigo">Birdigo</a>, which bills itself as "what if Balatro, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wordle-past-answers">Wordle</a>".

<p>Before you NYT sympathisers accuse me of riding far too high on my already stratospheric high horse, let me confess that a significant percentage of Rock Paper Shotgun's daily eyeballing comes from Wordle guides. I'm not saying that I sleep on a bed of Wordle guides, but if I had to stuff a mattress with any RPS content, it would be that. And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>. The idea of these two games forming one game makes me feel like I'm watching a stellar collision, and that's before you consider the birds. Combine Balatro and Wordle, and you get birds. These are the puns that cause our parents, children and employers to stop talking to us.</p>
<p>Birdigo is the brainspawn of John August, scriptwriter for Corpse Bride and Charlie's Angels, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bonfire-peaks">Bonfire Peaks</a> developer Corey Martin. Apparently it all started on a podcast. Nothing honourable ever begins with a podcast. The basic mechanic is assembling letter tiles to make words, which earn you "flaps" with which to fly a flock of fidgety, boggle-eyed wildfowl around the world. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3264170/Birdigo__bird_word_game/">The Steam page</a> acknowledges Scrabble as a third influence, here. If they were <em>true</em> artists, they'd have incorporated that into the title pun, but I guess they couldn't think of a SFW narrative theme for a game called Birdigrabble.</p>
<p>The Balatro element, meanwhile, takes the form of multipliers and modifiers which let you jimmy the basic scoring system. "Longer words score higher, but specific combos can turn short words into powerhouses," the Steam page comments. "Use enchanted feathers, letters and songs to change the rules of the game as you go." All japes and jeering aside, I think this is probably quite fun. It's out 30th July, and you can find a demo on Steam.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-end-is-nigh-for-balatro-and-wordle-have-had-a-terrible-avian-child]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/">Time Flies</a>, the latest wonderfully weird game from Swiss devs Playables, will turn you into a fly. I mean, the clue was in the name. You live for a matter of seconds every playthrough, and in that time, you've got a bug bucket list of stuff you can do.</p>
<p>You'd better not screw around. Or you'd better get on with screwing around. Either way, this cool cousin/sibling to the equally bizarre <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/double-fine-2018-games">Kids</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-my-exercise">My Exercise</a> is coming out on PC July 31st.</p>

<p>"Make the best of the time you have left, because weâre all going to die," reads Time Flies' Steam description. It's not wrong. It's hand-drawn world has "delightfully accurate fly physics", "numerous intriguing ways to die", and "grimly variable life expectancy based on player location".</p>
<p>If you want more info on that last part, artist and director Michael Frei explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/time-flies-lands-on-ps5-on-july-31/">PS Blog</a> that how long a playthrough of the game lasts depends on what average life expectancy according to the World Health Organization is in your region of the world. For example, if you're in the US, the game'll register that figure to be 76.4 years and give you 76.4 seconds to play before your fly dies. So, it looks like those of us in the UK'll be getting <a href="https://data.who.int/countries/826">about 80.1 seconds</a>.</p>

<p>In that time, you can accomplish bucket list goals by doing everything from getting drunk, to learning an instrument, to making someone laugh, to reading a book. Or you can try to find god, something Frei discusses in that blog post. Or you can just roll with it.</p>
<p>"What to do in this world before you die? That is a difficult question to answer," Frei wrote, "Luckily, the game contains a list of things for you to do. All you need to do is figure out how to do them, and then do them all within one lifetime. It might seem impossible at first, but you can die trying, and eventually youâll get the hang of it. It is a game about life, but you get many chances."</p>
<p>Sounds equally filled with fun and existential dread to me, and I'll definitely be adding it to my list of things to do before I eventually expire, likely just before getting to the DLC in my millionth Fallout New Vegas playthrough.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/time-flies-is-about-a-bug-finding-god-or-learning-guitar-in-something-like-764-seconds-and-its-got-a-release-date]]></content:encoded>

These findings were then confirmed via a YouTube video by Karting All Day titled âWhatâs the FASTEST way to go STRAIGHT in Mario Kart World?â Among the experiments shown in the video, a racer using Charge Jumps is shown going face to face against an identical racer who is simply accelerating forward without pressing any other buttons. The Charge Jump player definitively loses.</p><h2 id="h8299"><a id=""></a>The Charge Jump slows you down, no matter which character or vehicle you use</h2><p>The video by Karting All Day is probably enough evidence to show that you shouldnât spam Charge Jumps in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but just to be <em>extra </em>sure, I repeated the videoâs experiments myself.

So long story short, even if you shouldnât use Charge Jumps everywhere you go, you should absolutely experiment with them to see what shortcuts they might lead to.

Back when I used to play daily on PS4, there were, like, twelve. It was manageable. Nowadays? Not so much. How is a new player supposed to sift through thIS broad assortment of characters, find one that suits their playstyle preferences, skill level, and weapon likes or dislikes? Itâs a mess and a picture perfect example of bloat. But itâs not the end of the world, as we know which operators new players should thrive with in <em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,196299,196918" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h5860"><a id="1"></a>Sledge: Attacker</h2><figure id="" data-id="19b88d0e605fa8213e9d4f2d18092bc9" data-recommend-id="image://19b88d0e605fa8213e9d4f2d18092bc9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sledgeâs operator card in Rainbow Six Siege X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sledgeâs operator card in Rainbow Six Siege X." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19b88d0e605fa8213e9d4f2d18092bc9" data-recommend-id="image://19b88d0e605fa8213e9d4f2d18092bc9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sledgeâs operator card in Rainbow Six Siege X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sledge is a classic operator from the early days.

His ability, the Entry Denial Device, is an explosive trap that attaches to doors and window frames and, once activated via movement, explodes outward, taking down enemy Attackers.

            <p>
July is here in a waft of warmth (your meteorological mileage may vary), meaning a fresh batch of games has arrived for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. And it's a pretty exciting month, with CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> making its service debut, alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod's well-received Banishers.
</p>
<p>
That's not everything, obviously, and July brings a total of 10 new games across PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers. Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 15th July (with the exception of Cyberpunk 2077, which arrives a little earlier on 9th July), and you'll find the full list of this month's additions below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>
<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden | PS5</li>
<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Planet Zoo: Console Edition (PS5)</li>
<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there you go! Cyberpunk 2077 is obviously the biggie, but there's a bunch of other good stuff too. Planet Zoo's a rock-solid management sim, taking Frontier's usually rather lightweight formula and adding some welcome depth (it's also a treat if you just want to build stuff and stare at the beautifully realised animals), and the sun-kissed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tropico-6">Tropico 6</a> is a fine time for genre fans too. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, which we called a "poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">our four star review</a>. Also worth a look: Abiotic Factor's chaotic co-op survival in the depths of a paranormal research lab, and some similarly frenzied co-op action in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>. As for this month's Premium-exclusive retro titles, there's cult-classic driving mayhem in Twisted Metal 2 and 3, which launched for the original PlayStation in 1996 and 1998 respectively.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! As a reminder, the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June (aside from Cyberpunk 2077, which is out today) meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-your-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-june">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention shifts elsewhere. And as for July's Essential tier offerings, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-games-for-july">can read about them here</a>.

<figure><a title="Miyamoto - Super Nintendo World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca4def15ef96e/miyamoto-super-nintendo-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>During Nintendo's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">shareholder Q&amp;A meeting</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto stressed the importance for developers to "work for the consumer, not your boss", ensuring that teams can produce games that will satisfy players.</p>
<p>Afterwards, ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura added his own two cents to the conversation and stated that Miyamoto has always viewed games as "products", not "works of art", and believes that his background studying industrial art helped shaped this viewpoint (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shigeru-miyamotos-background-in-industrial-design-explains-his-pragmatic-product-not-art-approach-to-making-games-nintendo-veteran-says/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âMr. Miyamoto studied industrial design at an art university, and he views games as âproducts,â not âworks of art.â I think this perspective is what leads to game development thatâs more aligned with the user.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it's not clear from the quote, Imamura doesn't believe Miyamoto's view of games to be a negative one. Instead, it helps to ensure that game development is done in service of the player, ensuring that the final product is one of exceptional high quality.</p>
<p>The discussion over whether game development can be viewed as an art form has been ongoing for many years, and we believe that yes, it absolutely <em>is</em> an art form. But it's one that customers are ultimately paying good money to experience, and we don't necessarily believe it's wrong, therefore, to also view them as products.</p>
<p>Hey, if it helps make sure they're consistently great, then we're all for it.</p>

However, earlier this week another patch was released that caused a number of areas in Deep Desert to switch back to PvP, resulting in a number of players losing out on bases, equipment, and vehicles. In response, Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/" rel="nofollow ">shared an apology letter</a>, explaining the steps it plans to take to make it up to players.</p><p dir="ltr">Talking about how this mistake took place, Funcom explained that this was an "oversight in our development process and internal communications" and was "intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle. Weâre incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. Weâve changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Funcom noted that it will be working to "reimburse vehicles and items (to the best of our ability) to players who were impacted by this," and that those affected can find reimbursed items in the in-game "Claim Rewards" tab by the end of the week.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also outlined some of its other goals for future updates, which includes removing "all identified exploits (third party cheat engines, client hacks, or in-game exploitation of game mechanics)," as well as adding in more quality of life features, and fixing numerous ongoing gameplay issues. It also noted how it's fixed things like account/permission spoofing, vehicle ownership takeover, durability repair, and building dismantle item duplication.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have been affected by item and vehicle loss due to bugs, as opposed to the recent update, Funcom asked for your patience as it currently has a long backlog of customer support requests. It's aiming to deal with these as quickly as it can, including for closed tickets from players who weren't reimbursed properly when the developer wasn't able to around launch. Funcom also said the game has an entire team dedicated to mitigating vehicle and item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about trying the game out for yourself despite its teething issues, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dune-awakening-review/1900-6418381/" data-ref-id="1900-6418381">Dune Awakening review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team has released a new patch, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>This patch, known as update 1.2, addresses a number of fixes for areas such as quests, gameplay, and performance. It also adds the ability to customise your difficulty settings even further than before.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," the Oblivion Remastered team explained. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players."</p>

<p>In addition to these changes, Oblivion Remastered players who are part of the Steam Beta will also see that map markers should no longer disappear, while those NPCs that started floating about after being knocked down during the Priory of the Nine quest should have stopped doing that now. They really weren't meant to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, helmets should no longer clip into the player character's head, and Snak gra-Bura should no longer be missing those all important facial animations.</p>
<p>Bethesda and co have also addressed a sizable number of other fixes and changes as well as the above. You can check out the <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042">full patch notes for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered update 1.2 here</a>.</p>

<p>Like I have said, the above update will be in the game's Steam Beta. The Oblivion team has laid out how to be a part of the Beta, which you can see below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your Steam Library and navigate to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</li>
<li>Right click on "The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered" and select "Properties"</li>
<li>In the new properties pop-up window, select "Betas"</li>
<li>In the beta drop down to opt into, select "[beta]"</li>
<li>Wait for app to download new build and launch</li>
</ol>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-july-cyberpunk-2077-abiotic-factor-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-and-more/">announced</a> the games added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for July 2025, with Cyberpunk 2077 being the big title for the month, alongside Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, Risk of Rain 2, New World: Aeternum and more. </p>



<p>If you're a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, then you'll have nine new games to dive into beginning July 15, which is when all of this month's games, save for one, will be available. Abiotic Factor is the one title you'll have to wait for, since it is launching into the service on July 22, 2025. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers will only be missing out on the two Classic Catalog games, which are Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4, just in time for the new season of the Twisted Metal TV show, which premieres on July 31, 2025.</p>

<div><p>Cyberpunk 2077, however, is available right now for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, though it's just the standard version of the game and does not include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. That you'll still have to purchase separately, but at least it's available at a 30% discount for PlayStation Plus subscribers until July 23. </p><p>Here's the full list of games being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for July 2025:</p></div>



<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden (PS5)</li>



<li>Planet Zoo (PS5)</li>



<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>



<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>



<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>



<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PlayStation Plus is celebrating its 15-year anniversary this month, which partly explains why bigger titles like Cyberpunk 2077 are part of the catalog additions for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, and why all PS Plus subscribers got <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">Diablo IV earlier this month</a> as part of the three free games for Essential-tier subscribers.</p>



<p>According to PlayStation, there's still more to come as part of the anniversary celebrations. Hopefully we'll get to see what else there is soon. Perhaps a few more games for subscribers, as a cherry on top for the occasion? We'll see.</p>

            <p>The second of two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> updates Bethesda told us all they had up their buggy sleeves arrives in Steam Beta later today, July 9th. This one's update 1.2, and it's headlined by the sorts of performance improvements folks have been begging for, plus some difficulty setting tweaks.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, The Elder Scrolls 4.something's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-has-two-bug-fixing-updates-coming-sudden-glitchy-vampire-baldness">last update</a> did many things, but by fair the most noteworthy was stopping a vampire from succumbing to the urge all men get. That being the urge to become bald so you can save like Â£10 a year by no longer buying shampoo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for update 1.2, which you can check out in full via the Tweet embedded below, Bethesda's kicked off by outlining how it's switched up the settings that control how hard you get Mehrunes Donkgoned by enemies and how much damage you inflict by donking them back.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," they wrote. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players." I personally preferred yanking the slider on a bar that provides next to no info as to what exact difficulty you're at, but hopefully this helps folks out.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Beyond that, here are the much-requested tweaks the update makes to Oblivion Remastered's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">not always so hot performance</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>
<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>
<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>
<li>Optimise updating of character attachments.</li>
<li>Optimise rendering of water volumes in the open world.</li>
<li>Optimise light/shadow updates in several lairs.</li>
<li>Optimise waterfall particle FX and rendering.</li>
<li>Optimise the weather system.</li>
<li>Optimise character animation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hopefully all of that means you get more of the fun jank, and less of the jank that is the equivalent of a stranger taking a big poo on your living room carpet. Unless, of course that is your definition of fun. To each their own.</p>
<p>The update's out via Steam Beta first, with a full release on PC and those other platforms to follow at some point down the line.</p>

            <p>Back in June, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of alleged undocumented migrants in Los Angeles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Los_Angeles_protests">provoked a wave of protests</a>. The Trump administration attempted to make hay from the situation, dispatching federal military troops to the city in a show of toughness, against the objections of California's own governor. Despite this cynical cultivation of a pressure-cooker atmosphere, the majority of protesters were peaceful, albeit justifiably loud and angry at having their neighbours seized and imprisoned by random thugs at the behest of a dime store Palpatine.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I was in Los Angeles at the time covering Summer Game Fest, and saw a few of the protest marches up close while walking across the city. Aftermath has <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police">a good, longer report</a> on the unearthliness and angst of attending a game expo right in the middle of such events, including comments from other journalists and developers.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles protests and the Trump administration's wider policies on immigration have provoked additional demonstrations across the USA. They've also inspired an Itch.io charity bundle, <a href="https://itch.io/b/3110/no-ice-in-california">"No ICE in California"</a>, which spans 560 video games, physical games, game asset packs and other items from 268 developers for $10. Hosted by jesthehuman, the bundle has raised $26,712.19 as of the time of writing, with proceeds going to the <a href="https://www.immdef.org/">Immigrant Defenders Law Center</a>, a Los Angeles law firm who specialise in defending immigrant communities, and <a href="https://raicestexas.org/about">RAÃCES</a>, a Texas-based immigrant advocacy and support organisation.</p>
<p>As is RPS tradition, I've picked out a few bundle highlights. <a href="https://linker.itch.io/eleflipside">Elephantasy Flipside</a> (pictured) is a glorious isometric single-screen puzzler, the kind of thing I'd have had kittens over if I'd found it on a MacWorld shareware disc, back in the 90s. <a href="https://knifedemon.itch.io/brush-burial">Brush Burial</a> is a crushed and grimy immersive sim in which you are a knife-wielding cockroach. <a href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep">Periphery Synthetic EP</a> is a set of reactive, musical solar systems that can apparently be explored using echolocation and terrain sonification, if you're too cool for screens. And <a href="https://devonwiersma.itch.io/centauri-dark">Centauri Dark</a> is a gut-emptying rainbow of a bullet hell FPS.</p>
<p>Got highlights of your own? Please share. Beware that if you've bought other Itch.io charity bundles, you may own some of these games already.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-charity-game-bundle-raises-funds-to-defend-us-immigrants-against-ice]]></content:encoded>

Developer Funcom recently nerfed the endgame areaâs PVP potential, turning almost half of it into PVE-only territory. That has unintentionally now resulted in the land covered in a bunch of giant boxes. Hereâs why. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,196790,196345" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em>, which has continued attracting lots of players on PC despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808">a minor fall-off from its peak at launch</a></span>, is a survival crafting game. The natural progression system is harvesting stuff to build stuff to harvest more stuff to build bigger stuff. Eventually, that requires players to venture out into the largely PVP-centric Deep Desert in order to access the rarest Tier 6 materials. Early on, that meant getting preyed upon by roving bands of veterans who could easily outgun their weaker opponents (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501">or drop entire ships on them</a></span>). </p><p>So Funcom did the sensible thing and made the PVP <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section of the map smaller</a></span> with further plans to iterate on PVP mechanics and make it feel more engaging and fair. The studio also greatly increased the number of T6 resource nodes available in PVE areas. That patch went live <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this week</a></span>. The Deep Desert also wipes every week, deleting all players structures to keep things fresh and interesting. So some players were a bit surprised to find that shortly after the wipe this week, there were already resource nodes boarded up by other players, preventing them from being accessed. </p><p>âDD PVE T6 mats experience, a base on each nodes,â <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvikq8/dd_pve_t6_mats_experience_a_base_on_each_nodes_gj/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvikq8/dd_pve_t6_mats_experience_a_base_on_each_nodes_gj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player</a></span> on the <em>Dune: Awakening</em> subreddit today, alongside a picture what looks like a bunch of giant raised flower beds. âWell, looks similar to my Server,â wrote another in response. âThere goes another week without T6 mats or progression unless I want to get slaughtered by the Russian zerg that basically owns my serverâs DD...â Another angry player in a separate thread shared a similar image and story. âFirst day of the wipe, found around 15 bases built over titanium nodes in PvE area,â the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lus5uf/first_day_of_the_wipe_found_around_15_bases_built/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lus5uf/first_day_of_the_wipe_found_around_15_bases_built/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. âThird week of people being rats.â</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvimen/conversation_with_a_node_blocker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvimen/conversation_with_a_node_blocker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans speculate</a></span> that this latest form of griefing is aimed at getting desperate players to venture out into the PVP zones and force them to engage with hostile gangs who are otherwise bored of the underlying progression and base-building mechanics. âItâs not even productive for the person doing it,â one player lamented. âYou are not going to get regular enough use out of that ore for it to be worth farming, and no one gets the ores at all if a significant number of people do that.â<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvk1yd/building_on_nodes_brainstorm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lvk1yd/building_on_nodes_brainstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What are the solutions</a></span>? Some fans have suggested making resource nodes no-build zones, while others wonder if there is a way to simply have the resources spawn outside of the structure. Others have called for the spawn points to be randomized each wipe, giving non-griefers a fighting chance to get some resources before the dust settles. Then there are those who think resources like  Titanium and Stravidium should just spawn back in Hagga Basin, <em>Dune: Awakening</em>âs newb-friendly starting area. </p><p>In the meantime, PVE and PVP players are facing another stalemate in the Deep Desert and even some griefers are getting bored. âWe found and downed another guy, landed by him and he tells us that it was his 4th lost Thopter today, he didnât know how to pocket or something,â <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a PVP raider on the subreddit. âWe gave him a ride back, gave him more melange than his small refinery could dream of making in a dayâs worth of grinding and our old mk5 assault. After that, we realised that we arenât built for Funcomâs creative vision of the endgame.â </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-t6-resource-node-base-patch-notes-1851785897]]></content:encoded>
