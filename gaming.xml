		<p>Paradox ARC, the indie publishing arm of Paradox Interactive, has announced alongside developer CoolAndGood Games that it will no longer be publishing the space sim Starminer. CoolAndGood Games will continue developing the game independently, but a reason for the split has not been given. Back in October, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/starminer-will-require-more-development-time-before-early-access-release/">Starminer would require more development time before early access release.</a></p>

<p>In a statement, Paradox ARC said,<em> “After several years working together on Starminer, Paradox ARC and CoolAndGood Games have mutually agreed to part ways. CoolAndGood Games will continue development independently and will continue independently as they move towards the release of Starminer. We want to extend our sincere thanks to the CoolAndGood Games team. Building a game is always a journey, and we’re grateful for the vision and dedication they’ve brought to Starminer and our collaboration. To everyone who has followed Starminer’s development so far: thank you for being part of this journey with us. Your enthusiasm and support have meant a great deal. On our end, we’ll be cheering them on from the sidelines as they continue developing Starminer.”</em></p>
<p>CoolAndGames Games also released a statement saying, <em>“After several years of developing Starminer together with our publishing partner, we at CoolAndGood Games will be continuing forward on our own as we prepare for the game’s upcoming release in February. <wbr>We want to thank our friends at Paradox ARC for their support, collaboration, and belief in the project. Starminer has grown a great deal since it was announced, and we’re grateful for the foundation we built together. <wbr>For our community; your enthusiasm and feedback have been invaluable. Starminer has always been a project driven by passion, and your participation has helped shape the development of the game. As we move into the project’s next phase, we’re committed to delivering the best version of Starminer we can, and we can’t wait to show you what’s coming next!”</em></p>

<p>A release date for Starminer is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-flaws-system-great-how-it-works-rpg-xbox-obsidian-2000653910</link>
            <guid>1385188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was nearly 30 hours into <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> when I lied to a character during a conversation. A few moments later, a message popped up on my screen. I had lied enough times, apparently, that I was offered the chance to take a new secret trait that would force me to lie whenever possible, but I could do so perfectly. This is the Flaws System, and it’s one of my favorite features in a game I’ve played this year.</p> <p>Released earlier this year, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is Obsidian’s bigger and better open-world RPG sequel to 2019’s <em>The Outer Worlds.</em> If the first game was a fun attempt at recreating Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> formula, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is the studio nailing it. In fact, I think in some ways the team has beaten Bethesda at its own game, with improved writing, better combat, and some other cool ideas, like Flaws.</p>

 <p>Technically, <a href="https://theouterworlds.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Worlds_flaws">Flaws were a feature in the first<em> Outer Worlds</em></a>. But in that game, they offered a choice to take extra perk points in exchange for your stats being lowered in specific ways. Like, taking too much head damage would make you 100 percent worse at aiming guns. It was an okay idea that felt too punishing and wasn’t much fun. In <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2,</em> the Flaw system has been revamped to add more chaos to a playthrough. Now, Flaws can be really wild and offer a mix of negative and positive effects. For example, in <em>The Outer</em><em>&nbsp;Worlds 2</em>, if you steal a lot of items, the game will eventually detect this and offer you a Flaw that lets you sell stolen goods for double their value, but it also forces you to steal anything you get close to, which could cause some awkward moments in a store or town.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653924">©Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://theouterworlds2.wiki.fextralife.com/Flaws">Flaws in <em>Outer Worlds 2</em></a> can, if you desire, throw a wrench into your RPG experience and shake things up even dozens of hours into a playthrough. If you don’t look them up ahead of time, which you shouldn’t, they can spice up the latter half of the game<em>,</em> which can suffer from the same problem so many RPGs suffer from: letting you get stuck in a comfortable but boring rut.</p>

 <h2>How Flaws in <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> make it a better RPG</h2> <p>You know that point in an RPG where you’re nearing max level, have the weapons that work perfectly for your build, and have your skills dialed in. Fights become boring. Exploration isn’t as exciting either, as you’ve been to most places a few times now. This is the point at which many players put down the game and walk away. Maybe you push through to wrap it up, having less fun as you go. But with Flaws, the final stretch of&nbsp;<em>Outer Worlds 2</em> was still a wild time for me.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og6q38/skipping_through_dialogue_in_rpgs_finally_bit_me/">When I tried to speed through dialogue too much, I was offered a Flaw</a> that would let me gain more XP, but would randomly choose options during dialogue. Another Flaw offered to make my melee strikes more deadly in exchange for taking more damage when I blocked, an offer which came after I spent too much time punching random baddies and not enough time blocking and dodging.</p>

 <p>I didn’t accept all of them (and I definitely didn’t take the Flaw that makes you accept all Flaws moving forward), but just having such strange choices to contemplate 20+ hours into the game was fantastic. Each time a Flaw notification appeared, I perked up. And when I accepted one, like the Flaw that made me scared of mechs but able to do more damage to them, it altered my playthrough in a way I really appreciated and helped get me out of that “stuck in a rut” phase so many RPGs tend to end up in.</p> <p>The only problem now is that when I started playing a different game, I found myself longing for silly, interesting, and possibly game-breaking flaws to appear as I played. It was a treat to have the game react to how I was playing, actively tempting me with ways to indulge in bad behaviors or silly habits (like reloading too much) in exchange for some equally silly punishments. Now I want more games to do that. So here’s me permitting RPG devs to steal Flaws from <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2.</em> I’d like that, please!</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian just recently launched its acclaimed previous game, Divinity: Original Sin II, on Switch 2, and studio boss Swen Vincke said he tried hard to cut one element in particular for the new release.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/larian-ceo-swen-vincke-in-interview-i-hate-the-squirrel-and-the-great-freedom-for-divinity-after-baldurs-gate-3,1542810/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mein-MMO</a>, Vincke responded to the interviewer saying they are a big fan of the game's squirrel NPC, <a href="https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Lora" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Lora</a>. Vincke hates the little critter and wanted him gone for the re-release.</p><p>"It's funny that you like Sir Lora. I hate him. If there is one thing I regret about Original Sin 2, it's bringing Sir Lora into the game," he said.</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he "tried to remove him from the Switch 2 version," but Larian's QA team informed him that it was "too late."</p><p>"I really tried to get rid of him," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYWITWd1GJk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yYWITWd1GJk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vincke added that his Head of QA informed him that the team undertook efforts to cut Sir Lora and the team "almost succeeded." But the problem was that removing Sir Lora led to an issue where "it works in one region and not in another."</p><p>"We couldn't figure out why. Sir Lora just wouldn't die. We lost several days debugging to find an answer to that. Now it's too late, so we have to keep him," he said.</p><p>Vincke also shared some Sir Lora lore, saying the publisher behind Original Sin II wanted to have free DLC for the game, so Larian created the squirrel NPC "as a joke that doesn't really add anything to the game."</p><p>"Later we regretted bringing Sir Lora in because it only happened due to publisher pressure. And now we just want to get rid of him. But it's okay; it makes me happy that you enjoy him. There are people who put a lot of effort into creating him," Vincke said.</p><p>Original Sin II just launched for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">free upgrade available</a> for people who already own the game on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch.</p><p>Larian's next game is a new Divinity title, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">will not have any AI-created content in it</a>. The developer used generative AI to create concept art and to help with other development processes, however.</p><p>"It's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse," Vincke said, attempting to address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">concerns raised by developers.</a></p>

While they're not the newest iteration of Sony's premium noise-canceling headphones (those are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM</a>6), they offer impressive noise cancellation. Sound quality is excellent as well, and it can be further customized using the companion Sony Sound Connect app. They also offer up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and quick charging support that can restore three hours of playback in just three minutes of charging.</p><p>As for the WF-C700N earbuds, they may not be as popular as AirPods, but they're still a great option, offering IPX4 water resistance, multiple silicone earbud tips, a built-in microphone for hands-free calling, and the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously.</p><p>If you're shopping around for other headphone deals, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> headphones are also on sale for $398 (was $460) ahead of the holidays. This matches the all-time low price from Black Friday, though it's still quite a bit more expensive than the older WH-1000XM5. Most shoppers will find the WH-1000XM5 bundle to be the best offer right now, but if you need the latest and greatest gear, it's nice to see the XM6 back down to the same price as they were in late November.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> headphones are also quite cheap right now, with Amazon listing them for $180 (was $350). Offering up to 40 hours of battery life and a stylish design, they could be a nice alternative to the WH-1000XM5. Most colors are eligible for the discount, too, so it shouldn't be hard to snag something that fits your style.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Cabinets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>We <em>did,</em> however, hear a heated debate he had with his Mum (it really does catch them voices!), which wasn’t the kind of environmental storytelling we were going for, really.

<p><em>Stories abound.</em> For a period this year, Silksong and GameChat was like a pub to me and some friends. Whereas previously of an evening there might be memes or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> smacktalk in the WhatsApp chat, suddenly the group was quiet. But I could turn up to the Switch about 9pm and reliably get a notification toot (after that slightly exciting anticipation lag) that three friends were online and there was a GameChat invite. Click that 'C' button!</p>
<p>Four of us had bought Silksong (only two of whom had finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>) and embarked on its punishing, rewarding, sprawling journey together. Smash aside — I main as Corrin — I'm not really one for online multiplayer or co-op, and don’t know the pleasures of being a sun-praising Soulslover who summons others to duet a boss (and I’ve only played <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/dark_souls_ii_scholar_of_the_first_sin">Dark Souls 2</a>, sorry!).</p>

<p>But playing Silksong as a Silkchorus was a 2025 highlight, a single-player journey but shared through GameChat, with new (or new to Nintendo) possibilities suddenly enabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never watch Twitch but now found myself flicking across GameChat screens of an evening like channels on the telly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we had live fight analysis for some bosses, like the time Ibby was struggling trying to beat First Sinner, that frantic, fantastic, optional boss found in the Slab prison, <em>fwoomp</em>-ing in and out of the arena like Nightcrawler amidst a relentless barrage of lacerating silk and the music swells with violin violence.</p>
<p>But watching his screen, I noticed he wasn't making use of the hookshot — I don’t think it’s called a 'hookshot' — to gain that crucial horizontal distance and safety between threads. And so I told him, and he did, and bit by bit he began to make progress.</p>
<p>Though still not enough - there was a phase two. <em>Just one more go before calling it for today,</em> we agreed, and I watched his last run, the clean control and last-hurrah focus, and now it was phase two but I was keeping silent so as not to jinx it. Then I <em>erupted</em> as the Sinner went down.</p>
<p>At other times it was more rally-style co-driving, like when Sunny fought Disgraced Chef Lugoli in Sinner's Road, the screen busy with putrid globules and sideways bum barges, all of us chipping in to offload the overwhelm with shouts of "Cogflies Cogflies!" or "Heal heal heal!" at <em>just</em> the right moment.</p>
<p>(In theory. The chef went down later.)</p>
<figure data-uuid="bc5ce6ae7f71b"><a title="Silksong Co-op 17" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc5ce6ae7f71b/silksong-co-op-17.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Like this, but just boys. And Silksong. And no cameras. Okay, not like this. — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>An underrated effect of all this screen-sharing is that we’d get to repeatedly experience generational leaps in gaming, acclimatising to the fuzzy 10fps jerkiness of someone else's Pharloom, then — cool platforming section over — going back to our own game in gloriously rich, high-fidelity, full-screen wonder. In handheld especially, you get that shocking, popping clarity that looks like print, like a storybook given life. Silksong remastered!</p>
<p>So I started to really enjoy this Silksong TV. I never watch Twitch but now found myself flicking across GameChat screens of an evening like channels on the telly. And because of the game’s commendable open-ness — and tough-as-nails-ness — everyone would be somewhere different. There were rumours of a new area above west Greymoor, or a magical dice in the Blasted Steps that is <em>needed,</em> bro. Party members scouting out and reporting back with what the different key doors unlocked, telling each other to open our maps and leave waymarkers for secrets at places of interest we hadn’t even got to yet. This was our new version of the fabled playground chatter of yore, a co-created web of Silksong strategy (instead of whispers of a naked Lara cheat).</p>
<p>And for the record, we played plenty <em>ourselves</em>, too. I am, after all, primarily a solo, in-conversation-with-myself-and-the-game kind of player. But even then, there was that nice background awareness of a wider conversation, of having people to whom we could later recount the things we’d seen and done.</p>
<figure data-uuid="877c39a15a88d"><a title="Silksong Co-op 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/877c39a15a88d/silksong-co-op-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Much discussion was had about the platforming here. I got here before having the cloak. I do not recommend this. — <em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now hear me out - would it be a stretch to call all the actual chatting a game mechanic, too? Not just because of the shared intel and coaching, but because of that sort of <em>side-play</em> headspace you sometimes get into whilst chatting, like the long car drive catch-up where you barely notice the journey. We’d tap into the automaticity and free reps of working a section on repeat (that Bird’s Nest gauntlet owes me hours) whilst chatting life nonsense that kept the difficulty and seriousness <em>just</em> off the boil enough to get the details down. Then go off chat to lock-in and finish the job, sharing a video from the Nintendo app the next morning of you finally beating the Savage Beastfly.</p>
<p>(These posts were weirdly expressive of the different ways we’d all play. It was watching Mozo’s <em>clean AF</em> performance on Beastfly that taught me the usefulness of short-hop hits, even though he didn’t seem to do the badass last-minute ground dodge like Gothmog in <strong>Return of the King</strong>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I got more engrossed than most and ploughed through straight to the end of Act 3 and its gloriously exacting final battle, feeling the patterns out on repeat, going off chat for the final few goes, then re-entering and trying to act nonchalant when I'd beaten it. I’ve played it again since and it’s almost just rhythm action pattern matching now. Power in progress.</p>

<p>But the other guys fell off a bit after Act 2. New <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades</a> had come and provided some lighter respite, and another’s family member had begun some medical treatments.

            <guid>1385143</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sucker Punch Productions, the first-party PlayStation Studios team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">Ghost of Yotei,</a> Ghost of Tsushima, the inFamous series, and the Sly Cooper series, has officially entered into a new era with the departure of Brian Fleming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-will-stick-making-one-game-at-a-time/">one of the studio's co-founders and longtime studio head</a>.</p>



<p>The news was announced with <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/the-next-chapter-of-sucker-punch/">a blog post on the official Sony Interactive website</a>, where the company confirmed that Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley will be stepping into new roles as co-studio heads, with Nate Fox staying on as co-creative director to round out the studio's full leadership team.</p>



<p>It's unclear what Fleming has planned next, because it doesn't seem like he knows what that is. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406746502825660416/">In a LinkedIn post from Fleming</a> that followed the official announcement, he began, "<em>So, what do you think I should do next? That's the</em> <em>big question - because after 28 absolutely life changing years at the helm of Sucker Punch, I've decided it's time to shake up the snow-globe..."</em></p>



<p>"<em>I leave Sucker Punch in the capable hands of the strongest leadership team we've ever had - Adrian and Jason will do an amazing job as Studio Heads. And the rest of the directors - Nate, Joanna, Billy, Gail, Parker, Sonia, Rob, etc., they are all so capable and so ready for new challenges that I have nothing but confidence the studio will continue to flourish,"</em> he continued.</p>



<p>Fleming then confirmed that he hasn't yet seen his last day at Sucker Punch. That'll come in April 2026, as he'll continue to stay at the studio to assist with the transition for Connell and Bentley. Afterwards, he'll take a break and spend some time travelling with his family.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Fleming mentions that he's "<em>trying to sort out which opportunities</em>" he wants to explore, some of which he says are within the industry, "<em>some tech, some entertainment and some advocacy/politics stuff</em>." </p>



<p>Whatever Fleming does next, it'll be worth keeping an eye on. He might not be the creative genius behind everything at Sucker Punch for the last 28 years, but there are few leaders like him in the video game industry who are capable enough to lead a studio to continued strength and growth for over two decades. Sucker Punch has only grown in the eyes of players and PlayStation fans with each new franchise and remains one of the most beloved studios under PlayStation's umbrella.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what he does next, and how Sucker Punch continues without him in its new post-Fleming era.</p>

            <guid>1385131</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/the-last-of-us-co-creator-bruce-straleys-next-game-is-a-witchy">The Last of Us co-creator Bruce Straley revealed his next game, Coven of the Chicken Foot</a>, during The Game Awards 2025 earlier this month. Developed at Wildflower Interactive, a new studio Straley founded in 2022, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/coven-of-the-chicken-foot">Coven of the Chicken Foot</a> promises a witchy post-apocalyptic adventure about an old woman exploring a fantasy world after its dungeons have been plundered, its caves explored, and its enemies defeated.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, this witch will encounter an oddball companion that will autonomously work with you to complete puzzles, platform through levels, and more. During today's episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-3sQwv9arQQ?si=hwM9MUpOOpA-wqhh"><em>Kinda Funny Games Daily</em></a>, Straley appeared alongside host Greg Miller to briefly discuss Coven of the Chicken Foot before diving into the video game news of the day, which is what the show is about. During this chat, which happened at the top of the show, Straley explained that the idea behind Coven of the Chicken Foot had been lingering in his mind for years.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/mRNAbGYwvgg?si=n-0DFyB5fpuT2Wcg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRNAbGYwvgg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>While speaking to an old Naughty Dog colleague about game development, Straley recalls telling that colleague, "[I] have an idea that's been lingering for many years. It's actually an idea from way back when we started Jak and Daxter. It's just kind of been lingering; it's even in the Naughty Dog art book, like I drew some pictures and stuff." Presumably, Straley is referring to the 2014 Dark Horse Comics-published book, "The Art of Naughty Dog."&nbsp;</p><p>"The idea was there, and it was like, 'Okay, there are some things I still want to prove out.' Like, is there a way to tell stories that are more interactive with characters, in a world, rather than a story being told to me that's more about cutscenes and exposition?" Straley told Miller when asked about his journey back into game development after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/09/13/bruce-straley-director-of-uncharted-2-and-the-last-of-us-is-leaving-naughty-dog.aspx">a sabbatical that became a moment to depart from Naughty Dog back in 2017</a>. "Nothing wrong with that – I did a lot of that. For me, I wanted to go like, 'Okay, it's like a spiritual successor of Ellie.' Everything we learned about Ellie and making this character feel dynamic and responsive in combat wasn't the same Ellie that – when she got pouty or excited, those were scripted moments, and I wanted to know if I could create those kinds of moments dynamically, like in-game, letting the player drive the story and the relationship with the character and I was like, 'Okay, what if?'"&nbsp;</p><p>Straley explained that after a year of prototyping, Wildflower Interactive had three or four people on board and then created demos and pitched the game.&nbsp;</p><p>"The game said to me, 'I want to get made. This is a game I would play. It's a game that I'm proud to make,'" he concludes.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the show, Straley listed "Circe" by Madeline Miller and "The Buried Giant" by Kazuo Ishiguro as two significant sources of inspiration for Coven of the Chicken Foot.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no release date for Coven of the Chicken Foot yet, but it is currently in development at Wildflower Interactive for PC.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you excited to play Coven of the Chicken Foot?

<p>Sink your teeth in</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Poncle has just released a brand new gameplay trailer for its upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> spin-off, <em>*deep breath*</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_crawlers_the_turbo_wildcard_from_vampire_survivors">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors</a>, which is coming out some time in 2026.</p>
<p>And it probably should come with a health warning, because the chaotic blobber-inspired (that's a term used to describe a number of first-person RPGs from the '80, broadly) dungeon crawling rogue-lite is going to be a huge time sink, just like Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>Anyway, Vampire Crawlers will introduce your vampire hunting friends to turn-based combat, brand new abilities, new ways to use existing abilities, and... digging?</p>

<p>We've also got a sneak peak at some familiar locations, a museum, and other buildings that you'll likely need to use to progress. And yet somehow, it all seems to come together with that same moreish Vampire Survivors flair.</p>
<p>More details will be coming soon on the game, but for now, we just want to know when to take some time off work to sink our teeth into the game.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/</link>
            <guid>1385095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda has been known to 'jump the gun' when it comes to announcing its upcoming titles. Starfield, for example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-reveal-e3-90-percent-likely-2021-launch/">was a game we knew about for years before it released</a>, and there's an argument to be made that it was to the game's detriment that we knew about it coming for so long. Now, the same could be happening with The Elder Scrolls VI, as Bethesda provided an update on the game's development in a recent interview that essentially amounts to the studio saying nothing more than it's still coming.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">GameInformer</a>, three lead members of Bethesda spoke about how things are going with The Elder Scrolls VI. Studio director Angela Browder, director and executive producer Todd Howard, and studio design director Emil Pagliarulo. </p>



<p>No one dared to suggest a release window of any sort, and all of them said some version of Howard's initial comment, which was that "<em>It's progressing really well</em>." Pagliarulo was perhaps the most blunt and furthest away from marketing-speak, as he said, "<em>I can say that it's going</em>!"</p>



<p>"<em>It's funny, because the time pressure that players put on us, we don't put on ourselves,</em>" Pagliarulo continued. "<em>And I know that can be frustrating for players who are dying to play a game. Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games they take not just a long time to make, but a long time spit and polish and iron out the bugs. And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That's what I think people are going to want. So, we're going to make our time and as long as it needs to be great</em>."</p>



<p>Howard was much more succinct with his words. After saying that it is "<em>progressing really well</em>," he added, "<em>the majority of the studio's on VI, but I'll say this: we always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We wish it went a little bit faster - or a lot faster - but it's a process that we want to get right</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, Browder added that they are "<em>actively excited about what's in front of us</em>," with how hardware and technology have improved since development on The Elder Scrolls VI first started, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/">a comment that we've seen before regarding the game's protracted development</a>. "<em>The Elder Scrolls VI is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer</em>," Browder added.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it's good that the developers at Bethesda aren't putting a massive amount of pressure on themselves to try and get The Elder Scrolls VI done as soon as possible. No one does their best work if they're also always trying to think about getting their work done as fast as possible. Sometimes, you really do just need to sit with something and let it take as long as it takes before you end up in a good place.</p>



<p>That said, knowing that doesn't necessarily make the waiting easier for players. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">Even as Howard "<em>preaches patience</em>,"</a> the more the game sits in players minds as nothing but a short teaser that was shown to early, the more volatile its eventual launch will feel, which could be great for the game, or it could have the same impact it did with Starfield, where players are largely unimpressed with what Bethesda spent years toiling away on. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912</link>
            <guid>1385083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Larian Studios is experimenting <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850">with generative AI</a> and fans aren’t too happy. The head of the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> maker, Swen Vincke, released a new statement to try to explain the studio’s stance in more detail and make clear the controversial tech isn’t being used to cut jobs. “Any [Machine Learning] tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft,” he said.</p> <p>He was responding to a backlash that arose earlier today from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">a <em>Bloomberg</em> interview</a> which reported that Larian was moving forward with gen AI despite some internal concerns among staff. Vincke made clear the tech was only being used for things like placeholder text, PowerPoint presentations, and early concept art experiments and that nothing AI-generated would be included in Larian’s upcoming RPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The reaction on social media was swift. “Don’t mind me, currently living through my personal 9/11,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddybaldur/comments/1po65yn/dont_mind_me_currently_living_through_my_personal/">wrote</a> one fan on Reddit. “Consider my feedback: I loved working at Larian until AI,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">wrote</a> an artist who worked on <em>BG3</em>. “reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.”</p>

 <p>Vincke has since tried to address those concerns in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">long statement sent to <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists, writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Since concept art is being called out explicitly – we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.</p></blockquote> <p>The studio head reiterates that Larian is hiring more artists, not fewer, and that it’s bulking up its creative resources for its upcoming game, not trying to cut corners with AI. There won’t be AI in <em>Divinity</em>, Vincke has promised, and the aim is to help employees, not force the tech on them as some publishers like EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">have reportedly been doing</a>.</p> <p>But the statement doesn’t necessarily address deeper divisions over generative AI tools, which many have likened to being plagiarism machines, and the skepticism that’s bound to arise from letting it near game development at all. “Early Access and the way they managed their community across all their updates helped humanize that team in ways that only helped <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, weird for the studio to be so willing to throw all that goodwill away,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3ma4izugsds24">wrote</a> former<em> Giant Bomb</em> host Jeff Gerstmann.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/journalist-insists-half-life-3-will-launch-with-steam-machine-in-spring-2026/</link>
            <guid>1385080</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>If you can take your mind way back to the beginning of 2025, you might remember a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/is-2025-finally-the-real-year-of-half-life-3-confirmed/">fresh wave</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">rumors</a> suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> was finally reaching the final stages of production, and could be announced and/or released at any moment. Now, though, 2025 seems set to come to a close without any official news of a game fans have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/12/valves-doug-lombardi-kinda-confirms-half-life-3/">waiting</a> literal <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">decades</a> for.</p>
<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean a <em>Half-Life 3</em> announcement and/or release isn’t imminent, though. On the contrary, veteran journalist Mike Straw insisted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA">on a recent Insider Gaming podcast</a> that “everybody I’ve talked to are still adamant [<em>Half-Life 3</em>] is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.”</p>
<p>Straw—who has <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1514651538026815490">a long</a> <a href="https://x.com/mikestrawmedia/status/1869824116339159465?s=46">history</a> of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/">reporting</a> gaming rumors <a href="https://mikestrawmedia.com/column/lets-talk-about-anonymous-sources/">from anonymous sources</a>—said this <em>Half-Life 3</em> information is “not [from] these run-of-the-mill sources that haven’t gotten me information before. … These aren’t like random, one-off people.” And those sources are “still adamant that the game is coming in the spring,” Straw added, noting that he was “specifically told [that] spring 2026 [is the window] for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, [and] for <em>Half-Life 3</em>.”</p>
<h2>For real, this time?</h2>
<p>Tying the long-awaited <em>Half-Life 3</em> to a major hardware push that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">already been announced for an “early 2026” window</a> certainly sounds plausible, given previous leaks about the game’s advanced state of development. But there are still some reasons to doubt Straw’s “adamant” sources here.</p>
<p>For one, Straw admitted that the previous information he had received on potential <em>Half-Life 3</em> launch and/or announcement dates was not reliable enough to report in detail. “I had been told a date. I was not going to report that date because they weren’t 100 percent confident in that date,” he said. “That date has since passed.”</p>

                <p>While learning a language is challenging, it's never been easier to start, thanks to the abundance of learning apps and online classes. One of the longest-running and highest-rated of these is <a href="https://go.linkby.com/ONMGOMZQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosetta Stone</a>. The service offers comprehensive courses in 25 languages, all of which use a unique immersion learning style, making it one of the most effective language learning programs out there. Of course, as with any language-learning program, the trick is to stick with it--luckily, Rosetta Stone is offering <strong>a limited-time discount on lifetime subscriptions</strong>, dropping the price to<strong> just $149 (was $400)</strong>, which could make it much easier to commit to the process.</p><p>While the Lifetime Subscription is arguably the best deal, it's not the only Rosetta Stone discount. The 3-Month Plan is on sale for $48 (was $60; billed every three months), while the 12-Month Plan is $126 (was $240; billed every 12 months). While the Lifetime Plan includes all 25 languages (listed below), monthly plans only unlock a single language--making the lifetime subscription by far the best deal. All plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rosetta Stone also lets you gift plans to others, which could make this deal a fun holiday gift. Here's a look at all the options side-by-side:</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Subscription Discounts</h2><ul><li>Lifetime Plan -- $149 (<del>$400</del>) (single payment) | Includes 25 languages</li><li>12-month plan -- $126 (<del>$240</del>) (billed annually) | Includes one language</li><li>3-month plan -- $48 (<del>$60</del>) (billed every 3 months) | Includes one language</li></ul><p>Rosetta Stone's deals are only available for a limited time, so be sure to sign up at these discounted rates before they disappear.</p><p>Rosetta Stone offers mobile and web apps, all of which grant you access to the same set of lessons, activities, and learning tools. Rosetta Stone uses an immersion learning approach where lessons primarily use the langauge you're trying to learn, rather than relying on explanations and translations in your native language, especially as you pass the early lessons. That may sound more intimidating than, say, Duolingo, but the upshot is this approach is closer to how you would learn a language if you moved to a new country, which helps your brain learn the information faster.</p><p>Along with the lesson plans, Rosetta Stone also includes access to free livestream classes and interactive activities like Seek &amp; Speak visual vocabulary scavenger hunts, a collection of stories read by native speakers, and a Phrasebook filled with common words and phrases that use Rosetta Stone's proprietary TruAccent tool to aid in your pronunciation accuracy. The vast majority of Rosetta Stone's content is also downloadable and usable offline.</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Languages</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Arabic</li><li dir="ltr">Chinese (Mandarin)</li><li dir="ltr">Dutch</li><li dir="ltr">English (American)</li><li dir="ltr">English (British)</li><li dir="ltr">Farsi (Persian)</li><li dir="ltr">French</li><li dir="ltr">German</li><li dir="ltr">Greek</li><li dir="ltr">Hebrew</li><li dir="ltr">Hindi</li><li dir="ltr">Irish</li><li dir="ltr">Italian</li><li dir="ltr">Japanese</li><li dir="ltr">Korean</li><li dir="ltr">Latin</li><li dir="ltr">Polish</li><li dir="ltr">Portuguese (Brazil)</li><li dir="ltr">Russian</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Latin America)</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Spain)</li><li dir="ltr">Swedish</li><li dir="ltr">Tagalog (Filipino)</li><li dir="ltr">Turkish</li><li dir="ltr">Vietnamese</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psvr-2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle-is-still-on-sale-for-all-time-best-price/1100-6529777/">PSVR 2 Horizon Call Of The Mountain Bundle Is Still On Sale For All-Time Best Price</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>More chatter from Myles</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has received mostly positive reception, but it's safe to say that not everybody is keen on the dialogue from Samus' Federation Trooper pals. Now, thanks to a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXkXBIabO04">Bearborg</a> (cheers, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">VGC</a>), even more unused dialogue has been showcased (from approx 7:38 in the above video).</p>
<p>Accessed by simply listening in to the conversations between the Galactic Federation Troopers at Base Camp in Fury Green, some of the additional dialogue includes musings from VUE-995 about how much it can bench, a new breach technique from Nora Armstrong, and a recollection from Ezra Duke about an unpaid debt back on the planet Tanamaar.</p>
<p>All told, there's more than 30 minutes' worth of voiceover work that seemingly didn't make it into the final game, though why is anybody's guess. It's important to note that these conversations aren't mandatory to the story, and are instead bonus interactions that you can choose to listen in to when chilling out at Base Camp.</p>
<p>One of our key criticisms of Beyond wasn't due to the added dialogue, but rather the freqeuncy at which Myles Mackenzie would contact you over comms when you're about exploring Sol Valley. Ultimately, we thought the game was a welcome return for Samus, awarding it a score of 9/10.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-productions-co-founder-leaves-studio-after-nearly-30-years/</link>
            <guid>1385059</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge changing of the guard has occurred behind the scenes at Sucker Punch Productions. The mega-successful developer has announced that co-founder Brian Fleming has left, and two new faces will oversee the company’s future moving forward. </p>



<p>Since 1998, Brian Fleming has served as co-founder and producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch</a>. The team has created banger after banger through a myriad of Sly Cooper games, inFamous titles, and the acclaimed ‘Ghost’ series, from the PlayStation 1 all the way to the PS5. But December 16 is a significant day in the studio’s illustrious history.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The dawn of a new era. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment announced the big news through a blog <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/the-next-chapter-of-sucker-punch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> on December 16.</p>







<p>The article states that “The Next Chapter Begins” with Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley teaming up to take the studio forward with new releases and ideas. The statement rather transparently reveals that Fleming has actually ‘worked closely with PlayStation Studios to ensure that Sucker Punch was in the best hands moving forward’ for the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s a more in-depth look at the statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Jason and Adrian have been instrumental in shaping the creative and technical direction of Sucker Punch in recent years. Jason, who served as Co-Creative Director on the Ghost franchise, has helped define the studio’s visual identity and storytelling style, bringing cinematic depth and emotional resonance to PlayStation players around the world.</p>



<p>Adrian, as Technical Director, has led the studio’s engineering and production efforts, driving innovation across development tools and game systems that make Sucker Punch’s worlds so immersive. Together, they represent the perfect blend of creative vision and technical excellence that has always set the studio apart.</p>



<p>Nate Fox will continue as Co-Creative Director to complete the overall creative leadership team.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It closes by wishing Fleming the best and reassuring fans that Sucker Punch is in good hands with its new direction. There’s also a little eyebrow-raising line at the bottom about “Crafting new adventures.”</p>



<p>This is nothing new, as it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch might make a new Sly Cooper or inFamous game after Ghost of Yotei</a>. There’s still no word on the studio’s next game, but it will be under new leadership.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/unrecord-tencent-investment/</link>
            <guid>1385056</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers behind the viral game ‘Unrecord’ have announced that it has received investment from Tencent to accelerate its development.</p>







<p>In a report via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-makes-minority-investment-in-frances-drama-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gamesindustry.biz</a>, it was said that Tencent bought a “minority stake” in Unrecord publisher Drama Games, but the percentage and investment amount was not disclosed.</p>



<p>“Since the surge of attention after our initial trailer, we’ve worked relentlessly to build a game that meets the expectations of our community,” Drama studios CEO and founder Theo Hiribarne said.</p>



<p>“In Tencent, we found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision. Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in Unrecord early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>



<p>Tencent Games Europe’s VP of partnerships, Mark Maslowicz, said“Tencent believes deeply in creative talent. We’ve been consistently impressed by the drive and dynamism of Drama Studios, and the remarkable progress it has made on Unrecord, especially with such a small team and limited resources. This investment will help the studio unlock their full potential and deliver the first of many outstanding games. We’re excited to be part of Drama Studios journey.”</p>



<p>Unrecord currently has no set release date and it only targeting PC, but is currently number 9 on Steam’s wishlist chart.</p>







<p>The studio received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unrecord-developer-drama-studios-secures-2-5m-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.5 million in a seed series investment</a> from The Games Fund in September 2024.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best RPG of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-of-2025</link>
            <guid>1385053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The past few years have felt like an embarrassment of riches when it comes to RPGs, and so expectations were <em>high</em> going into 2025. Thankfully, the last 12 months certainly lived up to such a bar. While that's good for gamers, it made things more than a little tough when whittling down our list of the best role-playing games of the year, especially because we had a wide variety of RPG styles that satisfied different tastes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> gave us some of that Obsidian magic in a fantasy world that was tighter and more focused than many of its contemporaries, resulting in a game that didn’t feel as overwhelming as typical open-world RPGs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release">Deltarune</a>’s new chapters elevated the ongoing Undertale-adjacent saga to new heights with increasingly clever gameplay twists and sharper narrative chops. And if you had 100-plus hours to spare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> offered a stunning conclusion for an unforgettable journey to cap off the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The definition of RPG is fairly free-flowing these days, so you’ll see games with elements of the genre in our other award categories. But we made careful considerations for games with RPG mechanics at the forefront of their gameplay, along with deep stories, for this particular list. However, there can only be five games and one winner, so the IGN team voted and deliberated on which games would make up this year’s list. We believe the genre is in good hands with the games we picked, and the game we've chosen as the Best RPGs of 2025 is something very special.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best RPG of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Trails in the Sky: 1st Chapter</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-1765881299847.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trails series, part of the larger Legend of Heroes franchise, has been gaining more and more traction over recent years. But it’s tricky to recommend as it now numbers 13 entries, all of which are part of a continuous timeline. Remake <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter">Trails in the Sky: 1st Chapter</a> helps rememdy that problem, as it went right back to the beginning to create one of strongest and sharpest games in the series – and now, it’s the easiest one to recommend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails revolves around a deeply developed world with captivating geopolitical drama at its heart. 1st Chapter does such a good job of painting that broad picture, which is seen in detail through the eyes of its two leads, Estelle and Joshua. As budding Bracers (a peacekeeping guild) whose father is a legend in the guild, they're perfect conduits to provide a pretty intimate understanding of the world's various regions and how they feed into the larger story. The turn-based battles feature a fantastic blend of action combat and the series’ unique positioning system, which creates a gameplay flow that ushers you through this expanded version of this classic RPG. The true magic of Trails lies in the multifaceted stories from multiple perspectives, but it all starts here in Trails in the Sky, and this remake is a terrific representation of that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD-2D Remake</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-1765881324680.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix has done excellent work in revitalizing the Dragon Quest games of yore, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD-2D Remake</a> is the best example yet. The high-definition pixel art makeover is more than just a sensible way to pretty-up these classics, it also lets them stay true to the spirit of their original look without the weird pixel smoothing effect of past remasters. These Remakes also retain the turn-based combat system and characters without sacrificing the distinct spirit of the original games from all those years ago (frustrating difficulty spikes and all), but even then, quality of life improvements make sure they’re still enjoyable in a modern sense. Combined with the DQ3 HD-2D remake, these games complete the "Erdrick trilogy" of Dragon Quest games, and you can see how the series pioneered the genre, especially with the second entry’s emphasis on characters and storytelling. This package is one of the best examples of modernized nostalgia – faithful to the originals and approachable in today’s gaming landscape. And it’s some of the best role-playing we experienced this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – The Outer Worlds 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-the-outer-worlds-2-1765881341967.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to RPGs and letting players dictate how they interact with the world, Obsidian is one of the best studios to do it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> improves on the first game in almost every way, from punchier gunplay to much deeper role-playing systems. The options you have to build your character and make pivotal choices have a larger impact on what you can do in combat, but also create specific avenues for how quests play out. We keep pointing to the Flaws system, which was present in the original, but has been expanded in unpredictable, creative ways by giving you some serious pros/cons to consider based on your playing habits. However, the much more expansive areas, smarter level design, and dynamic combat encounters make sure the actual gameplay experience is a significant leap over the first game. And you can’t have an RPG of this style without choice and consequence at the heart of the story, and Obsidian reminds us with The Outer Worlds 2 that it still has the chops, even in a post-Fallout: New Vegas era.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-1765881358523.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is an investment that pays back multiple times over in its 120-hour runtime. It’s a commitment - a slow-burn game you have to want to live in. But it’s also an action-packed cinematic adventure that proves to have an emotional range that the original didn’t. You might be just "some guy" as Henry, yet that role often lets you see the world for what it is, whether you’re doing seemingly mundane activities or the pivotal story quests where your choices matter. What this game does better than most, though, is first-person melee combat, a tough thing that even the mighty Elder Scrolls franchise has struggled with for so long. It is intricate, skill-based, and stays engaging even as you get deeper into the furthest corners the campaign. Although developer Warhorse Studios arguably tries to bite off more than it can chew at times, you’ll find the quality writing and great combat leads you to a satisfying conclusion. This sequel might pick off where the first ended, but jumping into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 regardless of your experience will open you up to a rare RPG that deserves its flowers, 2025 or otherwise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765881377069.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Suprise, surprise – the Best RPG of 2025 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and for good reason. The folks at development team Sandfall Interactive drew direct inspiration from Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy 10 and Persona 5 (their words, not ours), and made the kind of game they wanted to play. We know there’s still a huge appetite for good turn-based RPGs, and Clair Obscur is further proof of that, but it’s the mechanics built into the combat system that makes it stand out. The active timing inputs keep you engaged in each fight, and recognizing attack patterns so that you may parry and inflict damage on an enemy turn is some of the most satisfying stuff we’ve experienced in a turn-based system. Each party member plays uniquely and has their own unique gameplay gimmick, as to represent a Job or Class, but there's then the Picto/Lumina system that lets you stack on perks and wild buffs – at some point it feels like you’re breaking the game. However, the toughest challenges ensure the game pushes back on you to really test your mastery and understanding of its more intricate mechanics. It’s one of the best combat systems we’ve seen in a good long while, and it keeps that momentum throughout its story and optional content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Expedition 33 wouldn’t be a true homage to JRPGs without a melodramatic and heartwrenching story. While it immediately hits you with the theme of time wiping away swathes of people – friends and loved ones disintegrating before your eyes – it grows into a meditation on grief and how it changes people, seen through the eyes of fully formed characters who change alongside each other. Whether or not you want intricate systems, fun combat, or deep stories from your RPGs, Clair Obscur delivered all of that in a way that won the hearts of us here at IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more of our end-of-the-year celebrations, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-awards-2025-winners">list of awards and nominees</a>, which is being updated daily in the lead-up to our official Best Game of 2025 announcement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael is the tech reviews editor at IGN, but regularly contributes to games coverage with reviews, features, and news.</em>

Kennedy also featured yet another familiar face from the series' past, fans believe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blink and you'll miss it, but the trailer also includes a blonde female character speaking to Leon over comms, who fans believe is none other than Sherry Birkin — and, listening to the voice performance, they may well have a point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sherry first popped up in Resident Evil 2 (where she met Leon for the first time) but more recently featured in Resident Evil 6. Compare Sherry's voice actress from Resi 6 to the dialogue heard in Capcom's new Requiem trailer, and the two sound remarkably similar, if not identical. Take a listen via the fan comparison embedded below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The character speaking to Leon is most likely Sherry Birkin, the voice is the same as hers in Resident Evil 6, the hair color is exactly the same, and she also works in the same organization as Leon, DSO.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REBHFun?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#REBHFun</a> <a href="https://t.co/mYXTGAfYYa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mYXTGAfYYa</a></p>— Waleed (@Waleedx2007) <a href="https://twitter.com/Waleedx2007/status/2000711516669039003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has remained coy about confirming Sherry, perhaps to give Leon his moment in the spotlight, but there seems no reason it couldn't be her. After all, Resident Evil 6 showed her working for the Division of Security Operations, the FBI-like government agency that also employs Leon. And with Leon involved, it seems straightforward enough that Sherry is also along for the ride. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Leon's recent confirmation, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna">Capcom's subsequent explanation that the floppy-haired fan favorite will feature in around half of the game</a>, Requiem is said to still hold plenty of mysteries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, as Resident Evil fans peer closer at Leon's reveal trailer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans">and celebrate the Resident Evil 4 star entering his "hot uncle" era</a>, there has also been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-capcom-really-kill-leon-in-resident-evil-requiem-new-images-showing-a-mysterious-mark-on-his-neck-have-fans-worried">concern over a nasty-looking mark glimpsed on the hero's neck</a>. Is it a zombie bite, or new infection? Could Capcom really bring Leon back just to kill him off, rather than let him retire in peace? Whatever's going on, Capcom has said Leon holds "a big secret" — hopefully Sherry can help him out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week also brought word of yet <em>another </em>returning Resident Evil character who will apparently also make an appearance, Rosemary Winters. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-gamestop-listing-leaves-fans-bewildered-by-mentioning-a-shock-second-character-and-its-not-leon">product listing for Requiem's Deluxe Edition that was leaked by GameStop</a> mentioned the inclusion of extra costumes for the character, who Capcom has so far not mentioned at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still a couple of months to go until Resident Evil Requiem releases on February 26, 2026, and until then, Capcom has certainly given fans plenty to discuss. Is there anyone else from the series' past that you'd like to see pop up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
