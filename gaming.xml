                <p>Thirteen years after it first appeared in The Sims 3, singer Katy Perry surprised fans when she reprised her hit song "Last Friday Night" at a concert this week--and sang in Simlish, the nonsense language of Sims characters.</p><p>On X, TheWitnessedBoy shared a clip from a TikTok user of Perry from a recent concert (via<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-simlish-sims-3-concert-last-friday-night-video-2000616677" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kotaku</a>), in which the singer accepted a fan's request to sing Last Friday Night in Simlish. Rather than sing the entire song in Simlish, Perry opted to start with the chorus. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry‚Äôs tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night üò≠ <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p>  ‚Äî Fadi ¬π‚Å¥¬≥ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Perry was a prominent promotional partner of Electronic Arts in marketing The Sims 3 in 2012, with the game's Showtime expansion pack even having a Katy Perry Collector's Edition.

But perhaps one of the most disruptive additions is the Springleg medallion, which brings some wild mobility to Fortnite. In the clip below, one player uses that medallion to leap around another player as if he was a cartoon character.</p><p>The clip was shared online by a Reddit user going by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mkuh5x/tryna_kill_bugs_bunny_over_here/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">jhhxft</a>, who compared the other player to Bugs Bunny.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is secretly the most popular game around. This May, the Roblox game "Grow a Garden" surpassed seven million concurrent users--but Roblox itself has been hugely popular, especially with kids, for years. Case in point: YouTube revealed today that Roblox-related videos have surpassed 1 <em>trillion</em> views. Trillion.</p><p>To celebrate the momentous number, YouTube has launched a Roblox Museum within Roblox, which the company describes as "a virtual space where anyone can go to visit over 100 special relics, each representing a key creator moment from over the years." YouTube and Roblox debuted within a year of each other, YouTube notes, and so Roblox videos have been a part of YouTube for almost its entire lifetime. If you don't play Roblox but want to check out the museum, YouTube released a preview hosted by Roblox content creators Lanaslifeee and MeEnyu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2Kfm-knAc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4q2Kfm-knAc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For those who want to check out the museum for themselves, you can also hop directly to the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/87445296052708/YouTubes-Roblox-Museum" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">museum's landing page</a> on Roblox. The museum also features a scavenger hunt that will reward you with an exclusive in-game item.</p><p>Roblox is the second game to reach the trillion-view milestone. Just short of three years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> reached a trillion views, and released a video to celebrate at the time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISWaWS7mVac" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ISWaWS7mVac" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This comes at an interesting moment for the game. A quick scroll through the comments reveals that players aren't terribly interested in the video itself, and are instead much more focused on the age verification requirements coming to the game, which involve allowing an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-new-age-verification-feature-uses-ai-to-scan-teens-video-selfies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI to scan a video selfie</a> before players will be allowed to fully access Roblox's soon-to-be tiered communication system.</p>

Its main chase card (<a href="https://zdcs.link/985GD8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Umbreon ex-161/131</a>) is commanding over $800, with lower-end SIR cards still pulling well over $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difference between now and a couple of months ago is getting these insanely valuable cards for the right price instead of paying over the odds. Here's a quick look at the <strong>top 10 most valuable cards</strong> to add to your collection, or deck if you've got Pok√©coins coming out of your ears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've gone into a bit more detail on every card, a touch more into the article, but the gist is that it's a <strong>good time</strong> to start collecting Prismatic Evolutions chase cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Believe it or not, prices have <em>actually</em> been correcting over the past two months, with some cards holding double their current value just a couple of months ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is very positive, meaning players and collectors can get their chase cards for the right price and watch them climb in value as time goes on. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolution: Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wait! Before we start:</strong> My favorite thing about Prismatic Evolutions is the sheer number of SIRs featuring non-Eeveelution Pok√©mon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They deserve some recognition too, so I‚Äôve put together this <em>extra </em>list to balance out the usual Eevee dominance. Here are my top ten honorable mentions for Prismatic Evolution, with artwork that‚Äôs arguably among the best we have ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the fantastical pastel color busts from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aebGZ6?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terapagos ex SIR</a> and the abract highlight work on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgA6m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Hands ex SIR</a> to The stained glass style of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbwYy?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragapult ex SIR</a> and the charging yet chaotic pose of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg7nv?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ceruledge ex SIR</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're considerably more affordable too, peaking at just under $94. That's where the value in Pok√©mon TCG is for me, the overlooked cards that are fantastic showpieces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to collect Prismatic Evolutions for cards that will increase in value over time without breaking your credit rating? This is where savvy collectors need to be looking in my opinion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Eevee ex - 167/131 - $112.98</h2><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226491"><div id="226491" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eevee ex - 167/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a03Ell?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a flexible card with a unique ability that allows it to evolve into any Pok√©mon ex that evolves from Eevee. Rainbow DNA opens up a wide range of build options and can slot into multiple strategies that rely on type variety or quick evolution plays. It can't evolve on your first turn or the turn it's played which helps keep the ability balanced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its attack, Coruscating Quartz, deals 200 damage for three Energy in Fire, Water, and Lightning. That Energy mix makes it a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck, especially in formats where consistency and type synergy are key. Most players will lean on it for evolution plays rather than raw damage output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eevee ex SIR remains a popular pull for collectors looking to complete their Eeveelution lineup. Its price has softened since release, but at $113, it is still one of the more valuable base Eevee cards we have seen in years and a vital piece for collectors aiming to build the full Prismatic Evolutions set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Roaring Moon ex - 162/131 - $143.67</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226490"><div id="226490" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3gV?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roaring Moon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a high-risk attacker built for aggressive plays. Its first attack, Frenzied Gouging, knocks out your opponent‚Äôs Active Pok√©mon instantly but deals 200 damage to itself in return. It can swing the game fast but leaves you wide open if you don‚Äôt have a backup plan. Calamity Storm is a more flexible option, hitting for 100 or 220 if you discard a Stadium in play, which makes it a strong follow-up or setup attack in the right deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The triple Darkness Energy cost means it‚Äôs better suited to decks that can ramp quickly or recycle Energy efficiently. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck, but one that rewards calculated aggression and tempo-heavy play. Roaring Moon isn‚Äôt for slow setups or cautious turns. It thrives when the goal is to close games quickly and apply pressure early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3gV?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roaring Moon ex SIR</a> Is also one of the few Paradox Pok√©mon in this set that commands significant value, and at over $140, it remains one of the most powerful and visually striking cards outside the Eeveelution lineup. The SIR artwork leans into the Paradox Pok√©mon‚Äôs primal energy with a dark, dramatic design that gives it real shelf presence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Flareon ex - 146/131 - $153.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226489"><div id="226489" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Flareon ex - 146/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/92x8Je?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flareon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions brings powerful fire-type pressure with two solid attacks. Burning Charge hits for 130 and accelerates energy by letting you search your deck for two Basic Energy and attach them to one of your Pok√©mon. It‚Äôs a strong early or mid-game setup option, especially in decks that need to build up attackers quickly. Carnelian deals a huge 280 damage, more than enough to take down most threats, though it comes with the drawback of preventing Flareon from attacking the next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That limitation makes careful sequencing important. You‚Äôll want to pair it with switching effects or find ways to reset the attack clause. The energy cost across both attacks is manageable for Fire decks that already use acceleration tools, and Flareon‚Äôs 270 HP helps it stay on the board long enough to make an impact. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck and shines brightest when built around a fast, punchy game plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/92x8Je?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flareon ex SIR</a> is now at a reasonable $153.99, and I think it's worth every penny for its design alone. The SIR artwork is warm and energetic, showing Flareon in mid-leap with embers flying around it. It‚Äôs one of the more visually dynamic Eeveelution cards in the set, and while the price has dipped, but it's a hot pick for collectors and aggressive Fire-type builds.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Glaceon ex - 150/131 - $179.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226488"><div id="226488" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Glaceon ex - 150/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a flexible attacker that can set up pressure early and close out games with precision. Frost Bullet deals 110 damage and chips 30 to a Benched Pok√©mon, which is useful for spreading damage or finishing off low-HP targets. Euclase is where the real power lies‚Äîit lets you instantly Knock Out a Pok√©mon that has exactly 6 damage counters on it. Timing this move well can swing the game by removing key threats without needing to hit massive numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 270 HP and one retreat cost make Glaceon reasonably durable and mobile on the field. It slots well into decks that aim to spread damage and play a patient control game. The Euclase setup does require planning, but it rewards clever players who can sequence damage properly. It's a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck and particularly rewarding for those who enjoy outplaying their opponents with calculated board control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> is up for grabs at $179.99 at the moment, making it one of the most valuable cards in this set whilst being much more reasonable than a couple of months back. The artwork captures Glaceon jumping infront of an snowflake-themed stained glass window, glowing with cool tones that perfectly reflect its icy theme. It‚Äôs a visually striking SIR and while the price has taken a hit, the card remains a strong pickup for control-focused decks and collectors alike.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Jolteon ex - 153/131 - $179.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226487"><div id="226487" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jolteon ex - 153/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3ed?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions offers a lot of burst damage potential in an aggressive Lightning deck. Flashing Spear starts at 60 damage but can scale up fast by discarding up to two Basic Energy from your Benched Pok√©mon, adding 90 more damage for each. With a proper setup, that‚Äôs an easy 240 damage for just two Energy on a Stage 1, which can take out most threats in one shot. Dravite is a powerful finisher at 280 damage, though the downside is Jolteon can't attack next turn after using it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 260 HP and free retreat, Jolteon is easy to pivot in and out of the Active Spot, making it great in fast-paced, tempo-focused lists. Managing your Energy between the Bench and Jolteon becomes key to maximizing damage output. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck and best suited for players who like high-risk, high-reward plays that can swing a match quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3ed?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> has dropped in value by nearly half since may, but $179.99 value for an SIR card is still a very valuable card. With this price stablizing, the only way for Jolteon ex SIR value is up a year from now. The artwork is packed with energy, showing Jolteon mid-sprint with lightning crackling around it. The bright yellow tones and motion lines give it a real sense of speed and power, making it one of the most kinetic-looking cards in the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Vaporeon ex - 149/131 - $200.98</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226486"><div id="226486" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vaporeon ex - 149/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> is one of the more disruptive cards in Prismatic Evolutions thanks to its board-wide pressure. Severe Squall hits every Pok√©mon ex your opponent controls for 60 damage, ignoring Weakness and Resistance. It‚Äôs a great way to chip at multiple threats at once, especially in formats where players rely on multiple evolved ex attackers. Its second move, Aquamarine, deals 280 damage, enough to take out nearly anything in front of it, though it comes with the usual drawback of preventing Vaporeon from attacking next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 280 HP and a Water typing, Vaporeon holds its own against a wide pool of current meta threats, especially when paired with support that can move it in and out of the Active Spot. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck and rewards players who enjoy spread damage and multi-turn strategies that slowly wear down the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> Is rocking up at $200.98, and that's now a stable value on a very expensive card, which no doubt will climb as time goes on. The art here is peaceful but detailed, showing Vaporeon calmly hopping atop of a body of water lit with soft blue tones. It‚Äôs less action-packed than some of the other Eeveelutions, but the underwater atmosphere makes it visually striking and a beautiful card for collectors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Leafeon ex - 144/131 - $209.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226484"><div id="226484" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Leafeon ex - 144/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbyOG?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex SIR</a> delivers high reward for players willing to build around its unique pressure and healing kit. Verdant Storm scales off Energy attached to all of your opponent‚Äôs Pok√©mon, dealing 60 damage per attachment, which makes it a strong counter to energy-heavy decks. Moss Agate hits for 230 and heals 100 damage from each of your Benched Pok√©mon, creating a swing turn that can punish aggressive decks while helping stabilize your board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 270 HP and access to reliable healing, Leafeon ex is hard to remove once established. It fits best in decks that expect long games where sustaining your own board matters just as much as chipping away at your opponent. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck and shines brightest when piloted with patience and timing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a great time to catch Leafeon ex SIR at $209.99, its a highly valued card whilst being at the best price we've seen for it. The artwork features Leafeon resting in a lush, sun-drenched forest, blending soft  natural lighting with delicate linework. It‚Äôs tranquil and earthy, offering collectors a scenic moment that stands out in a set full of dramatic poses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Espeon ex - 155/131 - $204.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226485"><div id="226485" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Espeon ex - 155/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgZ5M?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a> brings hand disruption and evolution control into one clean package. Psych Out hits for 160 and forces your opponent to discard a random card, which can slow down setup decks or break up combos. Amazez is where the real strategy lies. It devolves every evolved Pok√©mon your opponent has, shuffling their highest Stage back into their deck. Against evolution-heavy boards, this can completely reset your opponent‚Äôs progress and swing the game in your favor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 270 HP and a single retreat cost, Espeon ex is easy to slot into Psychic decks that want control elements. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck that rewards careful timing and matchup knowledge, especially against Stage 2-heavy builds or archetypes that rely on multi-turn setups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgZ5M?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a> is holding its value at just above $200 and is still one of the most premium non-Umbreon options in the set. The art captures a serene moment as Espeon perches in a moonlit field, its gaze piercing through lavender-toned shadows. The subtle lighting and dreamlike backdrop make this one of the more visually contemplative designs in the Prismatic Evolutions set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Sylveon ex - 156/131 - $315</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226483"><div id="226483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sylveon ex - 156/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYo8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a> plays a strong support-control role with disruptive attacks that can shut down your opponent‚Äôs strategy fast. Magical Charm hits for 160 and reduces incoming damage from the Defending Pok√©mon by 100 on your opponent‚Äôs next turn. It‚Äôs a simple but effective stall tactic that can keep your key Pok√©mon alive longer. Angelite is the big closer, letting you choose two of your opponent‚Äôs Benched Pok√©mon and shuffle them and all attached cards into their deck. It‚Äôs a powerful reset that can dismantle a board in one move, though you can‚Äôt use it on back-to-back turns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 270 HP and Psychic typing, Sylveon ex is a strong defensive piece in control-heavy decks or formats where board building is essential. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck that works best when played with patience and a plan to disrupt your opponent‚Äôs bench-focused strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYo8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a> is going for $315 right now, which is a reasonable price whilst being the second most valuable Prismatic Evolutions card. The card's art shows Sylveon in a soft, storybook-style meadow filled with blossoms, with warm pink tones and flowing ribbons that capture its fairy-like charm. It‚Äôs one of the most elegant designs in the set and continues to attract collectors even at a lower price point.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Umbreon ex - 161/131 - $869</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226482"><div id="226482" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Umbreon ex - 161/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/985GD8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Umbreon ex SIR</a> brings high-impact utility and pressure to Darkness decks with two strong attacks. Moon Mirage deals 160 damage and Confuses the opponent's Active Pok√©mon, forcing a coin flip before their next attack. That disruption can buy valuable time or force a retreat. Onyx is the showstopper. It discards all Energy from Umbreon ex and lets you take a Prize card outright, no matter the opponent‚Äôs board state. It‚Äôs a massive swing when used correctly and fits well into decks that want to finish games with surprise plays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 280 HP and with straightforward costs for its attacks, <a href="https://zdcs.link/985GD8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Umbreon ex SIR</a> is a flexible threat that earns a spot in slower control strategies or as a closer in prize race decks. It‚Äôs a tough addition to a trainer‚Äôs deck because of the high discard cost, but when timed right, it can steal games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the crown jewel of the Prismatic Evolutions set. Even after falling from its $1300 high, Umbreon ex SIR still holds an incredible value at $869. Let's not forget that the market for this card is now stable, which means it's only going to climb in value as the months go on and Scarlet and Violet becomes the previous generation to Mega Evolution. The SIR artwork is dark, moody and abstract, showing Umbreon sitting on some kind of plynth with darkness energy bursting out and surrounding a moon. It's dramatic and the crazy kind of artwork that makes collectors look closer. Umbreon ex SIR continues to be the most premium chase cards in the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolutions Price Watch - Sealed Boosters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to pull these cards yourself? Sealed Prismatic Evolutions product pricing is dropping significantly on TCGplayer. You won't find anything for MSRP, but nine times out of 10 it's a cheaper option than big box retailers such as Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that being said, I'd still recommend saving up for single cards whilst they're at their lowest, as Prismatic Evolutions is a very hard set to pull hits from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Popular comedy streaming service and website Dropout, formerly known as College Humor, has become more and more famous online thanks in large part to <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932">its hit show <em>Game Changer</em></a><em>. </em>The series, hosted by Dropout CEO Sam Reich, features comedians playing different, <a href="https://x.com/samreich/status/1953123165384917352">often complex, devious, and hilarious games</a> each episode. It‚Äôs a great concept for a show, and I wondered if Dropout would ever make a video game version of its viral sensation. The answer: Yeah, probably!</p> <p>I recently sat down and chatted with Reich as part of a larger interview about <em>Game Change</em>r and how the different games are designed, playtested, and balanced. And during that interview, which will be up at a later date, I had to ask if Reich and others at Dropout had ever contemplated a video game version of any of the streaming service‚Äôs shows.</p> <p>‚ÄúYeah, for sure,‚Äù said Reich during our Zoom interview. He clarified that it would likely be a game based on <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><em>Dimension 20,</em> the service‚Äôs super-popular D&amp;D series</a>, or one based on <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>‚ÄúI think that we would be into that and we‚Äôve talked about it,‚Äù explained the Dropout CEO and<em> Game Changer</em> host. ‚ÄúAnd I think it‚Äôs like, at this point, it‚Äôs honestly more than anything else, just like a bandwidth issue, which is if we‚Äôre going to do it, we want it to feel like us, which means we need to work on it. We‚Äôre not going to farm the IP out to some third party. We want it to feel personal. And it needs to be something, therefore, that we‚Äôre excited enough about and feels differentiated enough from what‚Äôs out there that it feels worth our time.‚Äù</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Changer Season 7 Trailer [Dropout Exclusive Series]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eu0nZh9rfw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He also admitted that another big barrier to Dropout developing something is just how expensive games are to create and how long it takes to make them.</p> <p>When I asked if Reich had <em>really</em> thought about this much and had some ideas for a <em>Game Changer</em> game, or if it was just a far-off fantasy that might happen, he confirmed that they ‚Äúdefinitely have ideas‚Äù of what a Dropout game would be, and they are working toward making one.</p> <p>‚ÄúPart of wanting to develop more of that competency was releasing all of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/dejavu-by-dropout-dot-tv">little web games</a> [featured in <em>Game Changer</em>],‚Äù said Reich. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start dabbling, you know, and like, see if we can speak this language at all.‚Äù</p> <p>In our interview, Reich sounded very confident that a <em>Game Changer</em> game is coming‚Ä¶one day, adding: ‚ÄúSo I would say we probably will do one. And it‚Äôs just a question of what and when.‚Äù</p> <p><em>Game Changer‚Äô</em>s season 7 finale airs exclusively on Dropout on August 11.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708]]></content:encoded>

Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA promised the plagiarized art would be removed and replaced, and thanks to an update today, these cards now feature the official artwork.</p><p>When Wisdom of Sea and Sky first launched on July 30, an artist by the name of Lanjiujiu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-card-art-following-potential-plagiarism-issue/1100-6533542/" data-ref-id="1100-6533542">came forward with a comparison</a> of their own art of Ho-Oh and the version that was seemingly traced over for the expansion's cards.</p><p>The developers immediately released a statement about the incident, claiming that "the card production team provided incorrect reference material as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p><p>Due to these issues, Pok√©mon TCG Pocket was forced to pull the art from both Ho-Oh EX and Lugia EX, the latter of which featured the plagiarized Ho-Oh artwork. That meant that for the next week players who cracked packs and received these legendary cards were greeted by an admittedly hilarious sight: a completely plain card that simply featured text saying that new artwork would be coming soon.</p><p>Now though, both Pok√©mon cards boast entirely new art, and players who already pulled them should now have the updated assets. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> spotted that the new replacement designs are credited to the same artist, Sie Nanahara, who also made the now-pulled art that these cards first launched with. In response to Pocket's plagiarized assets, as well as their swift removal, Lanjiujiu shared, "I appreciate the prompt resolution and hope this matter rests here."</p>

              <p>Originally released as part of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</i>, an augmented version of <i>Snake Eater</i> that hit PS2 the following year, <i>Metal Gear Online</i> was a strange beast. The online take on <i>MGS</i>‚Äô stealth gameplay would receive a few other iterations, with one accompanying <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i>, another a part of the PSP titles <i>Portable Ops</i> and <i>Peace Walker</i>, and lastly with <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>. (Let‚Äôs not talk about <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-survive-the-kotaku-review-1823584276"><i>Survive</i></a>. It doesn‚Äôt count.) For me, <i>MGO</i> was at its best in the version that accompanied <i>MGS4</i>, but in all the iterations I played, <i>MGO</i> remained something special, a celebration of <i>MGS</i>‚Äô tendency to be a little goofy and, of course, an engaging multiplayer stealth game when it (and the players) wanted it to be.</p> <p><i>MGO</i> arguably ushered in a new perspective for <i>Metal Gear</i> as it forced the series to adopt a now-standard moveable 3D camera that pivots around the character. Prior to its release, <i>MGS</i> used fixed camera angles, usually in a top-down or isometric perspective. That perspective wasn‚Äôt ideal for a multiplayer game. At the same time, <i>MGS</i> is far from a fast-paced shooter. It‚Äôs slower, encouraging a more methodical approach even if you‚Äôre responding to threats with lethal force. And that‚Äôs one aspect that made both traditional, single-player <i>MGS</i> and its online offshoots so special. Some modes of <i>MGO</i> encouraged a relatively hectic play style. Others, meanwhile, were almost entirely about stealth. Take ‚ÄúSneaking MIssion,‚Äù in which one player would take on the role of Snake as he stealthfully tried to knock out and steal dog tags from other players. Trying to stay hidden from actual flesh-and-blood players offered a kind of thrill that was quite distinct from what you‚Äôd get in the single-player games.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MGO2 PC (2023): SNEAKING MISSION WINS #1" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7f3K0eKi8c"></iframe></p> <p>Naturally, being a <i>Metal Gear </i>game, cardboard boxes, naughty magazines, exaggerated death screams, the ability to play as characters from the series, and more made the game feel like an appropriately absurd celebration of what so many of us love about these games. <i>MGS</i>‚Äô charm was and is never about one singular thing. It‚Äôs the sum of all of its wildly eccentric parts. That carried through in the various online modes it received over the years. I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/DRuouKk3TiY">just look at this nonsense</a>. Where else would you see something like this?</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Goodbye Metal Gear Online 2" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRuouKk3TiY"></iframe></p> <p>Modders have recently made incredible strides <a href="https://mgo2pc.com/">in their efforts</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqyQtjok9Qk">resurrect the <i>MGS4</i> iteration of <i>Metal Gear Online </i>on PC</a>, so this experience is not totally lost to time. And technically you can still play <i>MGSV</i>‚Äôs online mode, though every time I‚Äôve tried recently, I spend more time waiting for a match than I do playing. I also never cared for its class-based character selection.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Online</i> is due to return later this year though. ‚ÄúFox Hunt‚Äù is expected to launch in the fall as a part of the upcoming remake of <i>MGS3</i>, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>. Not a whole lot about this mode is known right now, though <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/">the game‚Äôs dedicated page promises</a> ‚Äúhide-and-seek based‚Äù gameplay ‚Äúthat utilizes the central elements of the base game‚Äìcamouflage and survival.‚Äù</p> <p><i>MGO</i> was always a niche experience, of interest to only the most passionate of us <i>MGS</i> dorks. Hopefully Fox Hunt will provide new, quirky experiences that‚Äôll satisfy this discerning crowd of stealth fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A software engineer who goes by Desimulate on X recently posted <a href="https://x.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116">a five-second clip of AI-generated pixel art</a> that went viral. Think your favorite Instagram pixel artist recreating <em>Daggerfall</em> with wild parallax scrolling effects. It was such a hit on Elon Musk‚Äôs Grok-infested social media platform that Desimulate decided to try and actually make the game the five-second clip would be from. But he‚Äôs not using AI to do it. Why? ‚ÄúWell, right now, the tools aren‚Äôt really good enough.‚Äù</p> <p>That‚Äôs what he told Ryan K. Rigney in the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/p/behind-the-three-letter-tweet-that-pissed-off-the-entire-games-industry"><em>Push to Talk</em> newsletter</a>. Desimulate said the viral post was the result of working very closely with Midjourney, using lots of specific reference art to try and hone the outputs while also trying to spur them into generating something new. ‚ÄúI just got obsessed with making something unique, and that post was the epitome of that for me. And it kind of came out of nowhere,‚Äù he told Rigney.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">omw <a href="https://t.co/eCiTOrjtzC">pic.twitter.com/eCiTOrjtzC</a></p> <p>‚Äî Desimulate (@de5imulate) <a href="https://twitter.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">But while AI can generate a five-second clip</a>, it‚Äôs nowhere near being able to generate an actual game based on it, let alone one as ambitious as an open-world fantasy RPG with extremely detailed pixel art. ‚ÄúThe meshes are probably good enough to make a basic game,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúSomething small. But this is a game that is kind of demanding, right? It‚Äôs going to be a real fantasy RPG. So at the end of the day, it‚Äôs going to have to be performant. The 3D generation stuff right now‚Ä¶the meshes are just not up to snuff. They are way too many triangles, polygons, and a lot of them kind of get messed up. And so it actually ends up taking more time to clean them than it would to just, like, start from the beginning. So we just use it as a visual reference.‚Äù</p>

 <p>Desimulate is not a game developer. Neither am I. So I can‚Äôt tell you whether he‚Äôs making any sense. But I can tell you that he‚Äôs now trying to hire people who are game developers to turn his viral AI GIF into a game. I‚Äôve encountered many a video game Kickstarter with vertical slices from people who have actually shipped games before that never came close to panning out. If I was a Polymarket guy, which I am definitely not, this is not the horse I‚Äôd be picking.</p> <p>But I do think the interview provides a fascinating and useful look into the allure of AI tools like Midjourney and what people think they‚Äôre doing when they work with them. It‚Äôs clear Desimulate feels like he has ownership over what the machine spit out, even though his contribution to it is a rounding error in the grand scheme of things like training data. Rigney asked why he‚Äôs the one to make the game imagined by the people upvoting his post. Here‚Äôs what he said:</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the vision, and everything starts with that vision. I‚Äôve got the passion to make it happen. In two weeks, I‚Äôve interviewed 40-plus people, brought a real team together of real game devs, started building, designing the game, and we‚Äôve made a ton of progress. Obviously everything is in an R&amp;D state. But I am committed to making it happen.‚Äù</p>

For many, this is already enabled and thus a non-issue as they attempt to play the beta.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Depending on your specific motherboard, the specific steps for turning Secure Boot on can be different, but it involves restarting your computer, accessing a menu before Windows begins to boot up, and making some tweaks. However, messing around with your BIOS can go awry, and indeed, some players have found they now simply boot into a black screen, temporarily preventing them from using their computer entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">A number of accounts like this have been shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1miaynl/comment/n76dv60/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, and anecdotally, GameSpot staff have heard directly from friends encountering just these sort of issues. The ultimate solution can involve having to remove the CMOS battery from the motherboard, flashing it, and relying on the board's integrated HDMI output, rather than a video card, in order to even get back into the BIOS menus.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unlikely EA plans to make changes to the Secure Boot requirement, even if it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-apparently-already-dealing-with-cheaters/1100-6533808/" data-ref-id="1100-6533808">doesn't seem to be entirely keeping cheaters at bay</a>. That could mean an even wider swath of players encounter Secure Boot players as the open beta expands to more players this weekend and the full version of Battlefield 6 launches in October. Activision has also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-has-new-security-measures-adding-secure-boot-requirement/1100-6533739/" data-ref-id="1100-6533739">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require Secure Boot</a>, and it's unlikely to be the last game to call for it. If you like playing multiplayer games on PC, you may just have to hope Secure Boot is already enabled or that you're among those fortunate enough to not encounter any problems in turning it on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‚Äòs open beta</a> launched less than 24 hours ago across consoles and PC. And already, there are numerous videos floating around that show players using cheating software that gives them an unfair advantage. This has led to a firestorm online as many PC players are upset about being forced to jump through hoops to use Secure Boot, tech designed to limit malicious activity, yet cheaters are already infesting <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em>‚Äòs beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 6, the highly anticipated <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta went live‚Ä¶if you had an early access code. Yeah, not really an open beta, but whatever. And despite EA devoting a lot of resources to preventing players from cheating, including the required use of Secure Boot, <a href="https://x.com/10IQGaming/status/1953781723592048760">players began sharing videos online</a> of what appear to be people playing the beta while using wallhacks and other cheats that reveal information about enemy players that shouldn‚Äôt be available. <a href="https://x.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383">One video</a> I found featured a montage, complete with music, of what appears to be one person killing dozens and dozens of other players across various matches and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All first-person shooters, like Counter-Strike 2, are affected by cheating ‚ö†Ô∏è</p> <p>Despite Anti-Cheat announcements, Battlefield 6 has been affected since day one üö´ <a href="https://t.co/cwxLPanq2N">pic.twitter.com/cwxLPanq2N</a></p> <p>‚Äî CS2 Vaccoin (@vaccoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/ItsHapa/status/1953515565084967379">Another video</a> of what appears to be a <em>BF6</em> open beta cheater has racked up nearly seven million views on Twitter. The video‚Äôs popularity and the huge response to it were big enough to attract the attention of <em>Battlefield</em> producer Alexia Christofi, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1953572607074202062">who replied and explained</a> that the team was aware of the cheating and that she believed the player in the clip had already been banned.&nbsp; So far, the cheating appears to be only on PC, though because of crossplay, these cheaters can play against Xbox and PS5 users.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA about the cheating seen in the videos and asked for more information on the situation.</p> <p>Of course, there‚Äôs no way to completely stop people from cheating in a video game that can be downloaded locally to a PC or console. But what is angering many players online is that <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7">like the upcoming <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em></a>, requires PC users to use Secure Boot. This is a relatively new technology that helps prevent malicious software from booting up on a Windows PC. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">Here‚Äôs how Activision describes the tech</a>: ‚ÄúSecure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.‚Äù</p> <p>The problem is that on some older setups, Secure Boot requires users to screw around with their BIOS, which can cause a lot of damage to a PC if done incorrectly. I mean, look at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">EA‚Äôs support page about Secure Boot</a> and the steps needed just to see if the feature is active or not on your computer, and you can see why it‚Äôs giving a lot of players trouble. And even if it does work, it‚Äôs a lot of hoops to jump through, and the end result is that people are still cheating. <em>BF6</em> isn‚Äôt even out yet, just in open beta, and cheaters have, in less than 48 hours, gotten wallhacks working in the game. You can understand why some players are royally upset about the whole situation.</p>

 <p>Vince Zampella, the head of Battlefield Studios, was asked about anti-cheat last week and <a href="https://youtu.be/MAA7X9J-Y8Q?t=831">said that until the ‚Äúday we die, we will be fighting‚Äù cheaters</a>.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a weird one, because you don‚Äôt want to talk about what you‚Äôre doing,‚Äù said Zampella in an interview with Gaming Interviews on YouTube. ‚ÄúIt gives people that are trying to cheat a head start against you. It‚Äôs a huge thing in the industry, in gaming. It‚Äôs a constant arms race that we‚Äôre always putting a lot of effort into, know that. It‚Äôs something that we would stamp out completely if we could, it‚Äôs just an arms race. To the day we die, we will be fighting it.‚Äù</p>

 <p><em><strong>Updated: 8/8/2025, 4:40 p.m. ET:</strong> </em><a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">EA has published a forum post</a> detailing its efforts to combat cheating in the <em>BF6</em> open beta. The company explained that Secure Boot isn‚Äôt and was never intended to be a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù against cheating in the game. It‚Äôs just part of a larger effort to combat naughty players. EA also claims to have prevented over 300,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‚Äòs open beta, and it‚Äôs received over 100,000 reports of players who might be cheating. They are now working to remove those players who are actually cheating.</p> <p>‚ÄúAnti-Cheat isn‚Äôt one and done,‚Äù explained an EA rep. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn‚Äôt always work in all of them. I hope this helps, and please keep the reports coming in ‚Äì we‚Äôll continue cleaning up the cheaters so you can have a fair game.‚Äù</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who has served as general manager (GM) of Diablo for the last five years, is leaving Blizzard.</p>



<p>He announced the news via social media on Friday afternoon.</p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúAfter five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it‚Äôs time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what‚Äôs next,‚Äù</strong> Fergusson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lvvud767y223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in his post.</a> <strong>‚ÄúThe teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of what we‚Äôve built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard in 2020 after spending years working on the Gears of War franchise at The Coalition under Xbox and Epic Games previously.</p>



<p>After the move was announced, Blizzard president <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Johanna Faries said</a>, <strong>‚ÄúGuiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary‚Äôs future is brighter because of the impact you‚Äôve had!‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>Xbox head Phil Spencer added: <strong>‚ÄúYou brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming‚Äôs most iconic franchises. Playing Diablo IV with you was a blast‚Äîthanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no replacement has been named nor was a reason given for Fergusson‚Äôs departure.</p>

                <p>Back in 2015, Techland partnered with Ampisound--a popular YouTube channel that‚Äôs known for its parkour-based content--to create a video promoting Dying Light. The idea was to showcase the real-life POV of a runner trying to escape a mob of zombies across various locations in Cambridge, UK. The video was a huge success. So much so, that after 10 years, Ampisound has released another real-life Dying Light video sponsored by Techland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWZxhQIWwU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="22">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVWZxhQIWwU?start=22" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ampisound‚Äôs latest video, named Zombie Escape! Parkour POV Chase, acts as a sequel of sorts, which is fitting considering it's being used to promote the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. As far as we can tell, there isn‚Äôt any indication that this is a direct continuation of what came before. That said, it does feature new runners (who all seem more knowledgeable this time around), a worse-off environment, and a larger number of zombies; some time has clearly passed since the last runner‚Äôs untimely demise.</p><p>It's safe to say that Techland is taking the Dying Light series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-gave-me-a-car-and-a-gun-but-i-just-couldnt-stop-dropkicking-zombies/1100-6532282/" data-ref-id="1100-6532282">back to its roots</a>. Not only are players getting a more linear experience and the return of Kyle Crane in the upcoming sequel, but there‚Äôs also a return to form, marketing wise. Will Techland‚Äôs efforts be enough to get fans to check out Dying Light: The Beast come September 19? We have a little over a month to find out.</p>

		<p>The AI apocalypse is upon us. Again. But that‚Äôs OK, because it‚Äôs giveaway time this weekend! With the beat ‚Äôem up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ra-ra-boom">Ra Ra Boom</a> set to launch on 12th August, Gylee Games has kindly shared ten codes for PlayStation with us to dish out to a handful of lucky winners, so you can go and fight back against our would-be robot oppressors!</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKOXf0Ye5Ig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the planet ruined by a rogue AI, there‚Äôs just one sanctuary for humanity left, and we‚Äôve spent our time preparing‚Ä¶ by training four carefully selected cheerleaders to become ninjas and shoot, smash and through the resurgent AI enemies.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs hand over to our<strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/ra-ra-boom-preview-an-apocalyptic-space-ninja-cheerleader-brawler-with-style/"> Ra Ra Boom preview</a></strong> from last month to meet our brawling foursome: ‚ÄúThis is a classic beat ‚Äòem up of the highest order, with four-player co-op giving you control of one of the four unique characters. They‚Äôre headed by Aris, a cheerleader who dual-wields Uzi-like machine guns, while my personal favourite Vee is the tank character, brutally pushing enemies back with her massive energy shield and chunky blows. Meanwhile, you‚Äôve got Ren, a super-fast samurai, and last, but not least, Saida, a cyborg with sass. They‚Äôre described as ninja space cheerleaders and, broadly speaking, they are. They‚Äôre undoubtedly a cool and engaging group that you‚Äôll want to take on an adventure smashing up robots.‚Äù</p>
<p>The game is launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th August, and we‚Äôve got ten copies of Ra Ra Boom to giveaway for PlayStation (UK/EU region)</p>

<p>Studio founder Mike Bithell shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">a message on Bluesky earlier today</a> stating that his studio ‚Äî which he founded in 2013 following the release and critical success behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thomas_was_alone">Thomas Was Alone</a> ‚Äî has "been unable to secure a new large scale project" and is "reducing in size" as a result.</p>
<p>With eleven jobs being made redundant, Bithell says that "This constitutes the majority of our full-time staff." But the studio was able to make this difficult process as easy as possible.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gwqvty&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025. We've fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance packages."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Around the time of the studio's most recent release, Tron: Catalyst, Bithell shared an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lrplvwf3g22z">extensive list of people who worked on the game</a>, all of whom are worth celebrating. And Bithell continues his statement with even more praise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's important to state that this was an incredible team of exceptionally talented people. If you're a developer reading this, and you're hiring; anyone among those affected would be a great addition to your studio, please reach out if we can help to put you in touch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bithell Games' existing self-published games will remain available and the existing members of the team will continue to support them, with the founder hoping that "your interest in our work follows individual team members" affected by the news.</p>
<p>"Bithell Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less."</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all of those made redundant at the studio.</p></section>

              <p>I had a <i>good</i> time with <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i></a> this year. Maybe it even peaked at ‚Äúgreat‚Äù a few times. I can‚Äôt say I remember much of the story, which was a major focus of this new <i>Doom</i>, but I did have a solid 20 or so hours blasting demons and cranking up the difficulty as high as it could go. And now a new update has arrived that amps things up even further with <i>The Dark Ages</i>‚Äô take on the Ripatorium.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>The Ripatorium showed up in 2020‚Äôs <i>Doom Eternal</i>, though then it was a part of the game‚Äôs campaign and you‚Äôd have to reload a specific checkpoint if you wanted to grind it for fun or practice. <i>The Dark Ages</i>, however, reintroduces the concept as a test of your wits and fortitude that you can play as many times as you want‚Äîthere‚Äôs even an endless mode if you really just want to dig in and refuse to let go. You can select up to 60 enemies from <i>The Dark Ages</i> to do battle with and it‚Äôs a ton of fun‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be surprised if you end up in over your head at first.</p> <p>On my first run through the Ripatorium, I maxed out all 60 enemy slots, half of which were fodder to keep my ammo reserves up. The rest were chosen at random from whatever looked the most intimidating. That was a bad idea, as I‚Äôd soon discover, since it turns out my <i>Dark Ages</i> skills are quite rusty. That said, having several of <i>Dark Ages</i>‚Äô biggest baddies all rush you at once is not only hilarious, it‚Äôs the kind of challenge that will call me to my ruin before I show them who‚Äôs really in charge here (me, the answer is me‚Ä¶eventually).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616695">Look, I‚Äôm really out of practice, okay? | ¬© Gif: id Software / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>The Dark Ages</i> offers up a nice set of modular options that let you fine-tune the game‚Äôs difficulty, and the update introduces some new ones, such as limits to how many Max Life Sigils you can have at any time, and a slider for Parry &amp; Melee Slow Motion. You can <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-release-notes">read the full update notes here</a>.</p> <p>The Ripatorium may have shut my cocky ass down at first, but it‚Äôs nice to have a reason to jump back into <i>The Dark Ages</i>‚Äô neat guns-and-shield gameplay. And currently it says ‚ÄúRipatorium 1.0‚Äù in the main menu, so hopefully we‚Äôll see some nice additions to this endless mode of carnage in the future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-is-working-%E2%80%98all-by-himself%E2%80%99-on-physint.1265946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima‚Äôs ‚Äòspiritual successor‚Äô to Metal Gear Solid (if Death Stranding 2 isn‚Äôt already that) has been floating around for a while, but beyond the name, we don‚Äôt know anything else about it. It‚Äôs named Physint, and it‚Äôs an all-new action espionage title, just like Metal Gear Solid was (and remains to be).</p>



<p>It‚Äôs set to be another cinematic epic from Kojima, further blurring the lines between cinematic production and traditional video game development. However, in a recent interview, the man himself confirmed he‚Äôs working solo at the moment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-alone">All Alone</h2>



<p>Fans of Hideo Kojima‚Äôs work are nothing short of excited about the creator‚Äôs imminent return to the action espionage space, a decade after he left Konami and turned his back on Metal Gear Solid. It was a few days ago that he was grilled on the MGS series, and when asked if he plans to play the Snake Eater remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he just laughed</a>.</p>



<p>The expectation is that Physint, whatever form it takes, will emerge on whatever comes next for PlayStation, which right now is looking like the PlayStation 6. Did you really expect another naming convention to pop up?</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Indie Wire</a>, Hideo Kojima explained the lay of the land with Physint, mentioning that he‚Äôs working on a solo bid at the moment. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was something:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;(I‚Äôm) also doing ‚ÄòPhysint‚Äô all by myself because that‚Äôs at the conceptual stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He‚Äôs planning Physint alongside the ongoing development of OD and the post-launch support of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which dropped just a few weeks ago and has been turning heads ever since.</p>



<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and the single step here is good old Hideo, using that raw brain power to create a concept that only he can concoct.</p>



<p>Do you have high hopes for Kojima‚Äôs return to action espionage games? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this summer, Hideo Kojima released his latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.

According to Kojima himself, most of the work on Physint hasn't exited the earliest stage of development.</p><p>Kojima told <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IndieWire </a>that he is "starting to work with the team on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, because that's a new project." He then added that he is "doing Physint all by myself because that's at the conceptual stage."</p><p>Physint was first announced during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sony-playstation-state-of-play-ps5-games-announcements-recap-january-2024/2900-5063/" data-ref-id="2900-5063">January 2024 State of Play broadcast</a>, and it was described as using "cutting-edge" technology to create a hybrid game and movie experience. Kojima subsequently revealed that the origin of the game came from players' desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">to revisit the stealth-action-espionage genre</a> that he helped create in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. </p><p>According to Kojima, production on both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">OD and Physint were impacted by the video game actors strike</a> that began in 2024 and ran well into this year.

                <p>Nintendo has filed a new patent application that suggests an interesting new way to play. The <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025163860" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patent</a> filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows a crank-like device built to attach to the side of a game controller, allowing you to <em>crank</em> up the fun. Eh?</p><p>The description of the patent goes into detail about the mouse-operation sensor and how the peripheral could attach to a recessed surface in the controller with a mouse operation sensor, which may suggest it could attach directly onto the Switch or Switch 2 Joy-Cons. Then with the crank attached you could explore the many possibilities of crank-based gameplay, from fishing games to probably a second thing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png" data-ref-id="1300-4546534" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png" data-ref-id="1300-4546534"></a><figcaption>World Intellectual Property Organization</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png"></figure><p>While fairly novel, this wouldn't be the first example of a video game device with a crank. The indie handheld hardware <a href="https://play.date/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Playdate</a> has a crank and developers and homebrew artisans alike have been coming up with various applications for it. And Nintendo did once make a cardboard crank with Nintendo Labo, so the company is no stranger to cranks.</p><p>Keep in mind, of course, that a patent application doesn't mean the product will ever come to market. It simply shows that Nintendo has had the idea, not whether the company has decided it's a viable product with wide enough consumer appeal and software applications to produce. Don't count on buying your Nintendo-brand crank anytime soon, but it is at least a possibility that it will come out in some form.

Nintendo's wading into the baby and toddler market with a new toy, clothing, and "general goods" range it's pulling together under the My Mario banner. And there's even a toddler-friendly stop motion Mario series releasing to accompany the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
My Mario is described as a "series which parents and children can enjoy together", and includes a mix of Nintendo's own products alongside those of partner companies. That starts with Nintendo's new animated Mario series - titled It's Me, Mario! Stop Motion Shorts - which will exist on the My Mario website and other channels. Each free episode is around a minute long and focuses on stop motion Mario showing "a variety of expressions and movements".

<p>
Elsewhere in the digital realm is Nintendo's free Hello, Mario! app for smart devices and Switch. This'll let children muck around with Mario's face in a way that sounds quite a lot like Mario 64's iconic title screen - yank him and he'll "react in various ways based on the player's input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, My Mario's website <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/block/index.html">features a dizzying array of baby and toddler-appropriate paraphernalia</a>, including bowls and spoons, cute Mario-themed hoodies, t-shirts, picture books, bibs, pyjamas, blankets, plushies, nappy bags, socks, rattles, and other bits and bobs.
</p>

<p>
Nintendo's own biggie, though, is a series of wooden block sets, one with three pieces and the other with 30. The bigger set costs 19,980 yen (around ¬£100) and comes with a variety of classic Mushroom Kingdom cuboids, including the question mark block, the brick block, and the music note block. It also includes wooden power-ups - a super mushroom, green shell, fire flower, and super star - plus a chunky green warp pipe, with the box itself opening out to reveal a mini diorama scene. And finally, there are wooden versions of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi which, most notably, also double up as their respective amiibo figures for use in compatible games. So if you're still in the grip of amiibo collecting, you've now got something else to add to your list. That three block set, incidentally, costs 2,980 yen (around ¬£15) and comes with Mario, a question mark block, and super mushroom.

All the above is included in Nintendo's first wave of My Mario products, which arrives in Japan on 26th August. My Mario will launch elsewhere in the world beginning in 2026.

<p>Compared to the GameCube and PS2 release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> ‚Äî which was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pac-man-world-2-is-getting-the-re-pac-treatment">announced last week in the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> ‚Äî looks pretty darn good. And just in case you've forgotten what the game looked like on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pac-man_world_2">GameCube</a> (or PS2), then Bandai Namco has you covered.</p>
<p>The publisher put out a comparison video for its upcoming remaster of the 2002 platformer, and it's not until you see the two versions side-by-side that you realise just how much work has been put into the 2025 release.</p>
<p>It almost looks like an entirely different game, with environments enhanced and sometimes "redrawn" to add more textures and depth. All things modern consoles are much more capable of handling.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest glow-up of them all comes from the water level, which looks lovely in Re-Pac. Hey, those original water visuals are still pretty good for 2002, though!</p>

<p>Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac launches on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>. It's coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2, but the latter will be a Game-Key Card release.</p>

		<p>To All Beavers of Slatsville Who May Have Been Affected by Recent Events:</p><p>It has come to my attention that the past several months have been difficult for our <em>Timberborn </em>settlement, and some of you have not felt seen by the management of Slatsville. This could not be further from the truth, but words are cheap and actions speak louder so as your manager I am personally extending this apology.</p><p>I am sorry. I need to do better and I will do better, and that process starts with taking accountability.</p><p>I am sorry that I did not notice the food warehouses and water tanks were slowly emptying well before the Cycle 4 Drought. I am sorry that apparently my first response to learning of the resulting food shortage was that ‚Äúthis will self-correct, don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù While true, obviously a devastating famine is not the mechanism by which any of us would like to handle these issues.</p><p>I regret that the Great Reservoir I built to address future drought issues was overtopped by the radioactive runoff of the Cycle 7 Badtide which killed all our crops and forests and led to the Second Great Famine of Cycle 8.&nbsp;</p><p>I do feel I must point out, purely for the sake of fairness, that this led to meaningful reforms and an attempt to prevent recurrences of this issue. The flood and famine prompted construction of the Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel so that never again would our drinking water and arable farmland be inundated by radioactive floodwaters.</p><p>However, the fact that the Great Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel did not have enough capacity to channel all the runoff into the river was regrettable. As was the backwash of radioactive waste that flooded the Industrial Canyon District as well as most of our farmland (again). I have heard your stories and felt your pain over this incident. But all this was also completely unforeseeable, and I am comforted by the fact that nobody could have prevented this disaster.</p>

              <p>During a recent concert, pop star and former <em>American Idol</em> judge Katy Perry was asked by a fan in the audience to sing the Simlish version of ‚ÄúLast Friday Night‚Äù as it appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-3-sucks-1826683414"><em>The Sims 3</em></a>‚Äòs DLC ‚Äú<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-is-now-making-video-games-5876893">Katy Perry‚Äôs Sweet Treats.</a>‚Äù And the singer obliged, singing a good chunk of the song live in front of a lot of people who were likely confused as to why Perry was suddenly singing in gibberish.</p> <p>Released in 2009, Maxis and EA‚Äôs <em>The Sims 3</em> was a massive hit and received plenty of post-launch DLC and updates, as is the case with nearly every major <em>Sims</em> game. One of these DLCs was a <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_3:_Katy_Perry%27s_Sweet_Treats">2012 Stuff Pack that was themed entirely around Katy Perry</a>. It added new clothes, hairstyles, in-game items, and locations to <em>The Sims 3.</em> It also included a new in-game song: A version of ‚ÄúLast Friday Night‚Äù sung in Simlish (the franchise‚Äôs made-up language) by Katy Perry. It was a pretty popular pack, and her Simlish rendition of the pop hit became a bit of a viral meme back in the day. Fast forward to August 6 of this year when‚Äìas seen in a video posted on Twitter‚ÄìPerry was handed a piece of paper at a concert that contained the lyrics to that Simlish version of the song.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry‚Äôs tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night üò≠ <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p> <p>‚Äî Fadi ¬π‚Å¥¬≥ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúOh no, I shouldn‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶‚Äù Perry joked as she walked up to some fans who appeared to be signaling for attention and requesting her to sing the Simlish pop song. She then added, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go to the chorus,‚Äù likely not wanting to perform the entire song in Simlish during a live concert. To Perry‚Äôs credit, she sang the strange version of the song using the provided lyrics, despite being unable to read the small text properly without her reading glasses.</p> <p>After singing, she shouted out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you had to be there, 2009 and 10.‚Äù Which is funny, but also inaccurate, Katy Perry. You performed the Simlish version of ‚ÄúLast Friday Night‚Äù in 2012. There‚Äôs even a video of you singing it in a recording booth for EA! Speaking of, let‚Äôs end this blog with that video. Roll that footage!</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katy Perry - Last Friday Night in Simlish" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxyW6AJ-yIk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November, Fallout 4 will celebrate its tenth anniversary, having been released way back in 2015. As the best-selling game in the series (provided you don‚Äôt count the tens of millions of players passing through Fallout 76), it‚Äôs well placed to receive an Anniversary Edition. As we all know, Bethesda Game Studios loves any reason to re-release an old game.</p>



<p>However, the current-gen update introduced last year and already a busy slate at Bethesda Game Studios might have nipped any chance of Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition surfacing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-boston">Back to Boston</h2>



<p>Fallout 4 was released by Bethesda Game Studios on November 10, 2025, which means we‚Äôre mere months away from the game‚Äôs tenth anniversary. It‚Äôs one heck of a milestone, and as it‚Äôs still one of the most popular games in the series, particularly amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the modding community</a>, could we see it get a little more love this year from Bethesda?</p>



<p>Fans are hopeful that <strong>something </strong>will drop to celebrate the game‚Äôs milestone, but let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôll probably be some kind of crossover bundle or event released in Fallout 76, which is where Bethesda‚Äôs sole focus sits right now for the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>In 2017, Fallout 4 received a Game of the Year Edition, bundled with every one of the game‚Äôs stellar expansions and smaller pieces of downloadable content. Last year, shortly after the award-winning Fallout TV show debuted, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fix-fallout-4-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 current-gen upgrade</a> was released, adding more content to the game and bringing it up to spec.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs enough to assume that there <strong>won‚Äôt </strong>be a re-release of Fallout 4, as it‚Äôs safe to say that there‚Äôs no appetite for anyone to purchase the game <strong>again </strong>unless there is a strong incentive to do so.</p>



<p>As a die-hard Fallout fan, I‚Äôd buy it just to own it. In any case, it‚Äôs the kind of thing that might launch on the Game Pass service, just like Oblivion Remastered did, which scrubs away <strong>even more </strong>sales (unless they rely heavily on other platforms).</p>



<p>They‚Äôre busy, similar products already exist, and there‚Äôs probably no real appetite for it. I think November will come and go without anything more than a fancy graphic released by Bethesda Game Studios to celebrate the milestone.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about potentially getting a Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<section><p>Clair Obscur isn‚Äôt like the other turn-based RPGs--at least, that‚Äôs what the worst fans want you to think.</p></section>

                <p>When I first saw it at the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase, I was surprised to see a game from a French developer with the photorealism of Western RPGs and mechanical stylings of Japanese ones. Its polished, cinematic trailer gave the impression of a AAA game, even though I'd never even heard of Sandfall Interactive at the time.</p><p>Clair Obscur moved mountains. Despite its launch on the same weekend as Oblivion Remastered, it sold 500,000 copies within 24 hours and 1 million after three days. It's still maintaining the discourse and curiosity of the games community months later--something that you'd think only a title from a more experienced studio could do. It's all for good reason, of course--it's a great game. We even rated it a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/">Clair Obscur review</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>In many ways, its critical and commercial triumph has been encouraging. We <em>should </em>have a wide range of RPGs made by people from different backgrounds, and we <em>should </em>have more turn-based RPGs. However, Clair Obscur's success also magnified criticisms of Japanese turn-based games, only some of which are deserved. Finally, the haters said, a turn-based RPG that is actually good--as if those don't already exist.</p><p>It raises the question: Why do people think Clair Obscur is "better" than Japanese RPGs that feature similar stories and layered, turn-based gameplay? It may not do anything revolutionary, but somehow wrapping the same ideas into a Westernized package makes that easy to overlook.</p><h2>A genre by any other name</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545875"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 16 moves away from turn-based combat in favor of fast-paced real-time action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg"></figure><p>It's not radical to claim that turn-based RPGs, like Clair Obscur, were popularized through Japanese developers like Square Enix. So much so, in fact, that the term JRPG became synonymous with turn-based games that often featured anime-style art. However, JRPG really means just what it reads: a Japanese RPG. The term JRPG became a hot topic after <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/if-developers-dont-like-the-term-jrpg-what-do-we-use-instead/" rel="nofollow ">FF16 director Naoki Yoshida</a> admitted he viewed it as "a discriminatory term" when he first heard it. After all, it others Japanese RPGs from the rest of the genre.</p><p>Favoritism towards Western games shows in the sales. Persona 5, which was enough to break Persona (and, arguably, Shin Megami Tensei in general) out of cult classic status, took over three years to reach <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2019/12/persona-5-worldwide-shipments-top-3-2-million-persona-5-royal-japanese-shipments-top-400000">3.2 million copies</a> sold across PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. And yet despite its critical acclaim and connection to a larger series, it took nine years and two distinct versions of Persona 5 for the game to reach <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1735796959343190092" rel="nofollow ">over 10 million copies</a> sold--that's a much slower rate than Clair Obscur.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload, the highly anticipated remake of Persona 3, sold <a href="https://www.sakuraindex.jp/press-releases/persona-3-reload-sales-reach-22-million-worldwide/" rel="nofollow ">1 million copies</a> in over a week, making it the fastest selling Atlus title ever released. And yet, Clair Obscur did that in just half a day. Toyo Securities estimated Final Fantasy 16 hit about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analyst-apologises-for-mistakenly-claiming-final-fantasy-16-sold-35m-copies" rel="nofollow ">3.5 million sales</a> in March, nearly two years after the cinematic AAA title was released. Last we heard, Clair Obscur reached 3.3 million just 33 days after its release (wild coincidence, we know).This isn't just a turn-based RPG bias, either. Baldur's Gate 3 sold over 2.5 million copies in early access before its official launch, and over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed" rel="nofollow ">15 million copies</a> total after one year. And yet, the critically acclaimed but more stylized grid-based RPG, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, sits at just over 4 million units sold--and it's currently the best selling title in the long-running series.</p><p>Sure, it's not <em>all </em>JRPGs. Elden Ring is created by Japanese developer FromSoftware and technically could be classified as a Japanese RPG, but has managed to sell over <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/we-are-profoundly-thankful-for-your-lasting-devotion-elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-sold-just-a-month-before-elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow ">30 million copies</a> worldwide. Yet somehow, I don't think it'd do as well if it forced you to play as a spiky-haired dude with a sword, or an anime babe.</p><h2>Xenoblade vs. Clair Obscur</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545881"></a><figcaption>Xenoblade 3 digs into the story behind each character in a way that feels natural, even without the one-on-one bonding in games like Persona 5 or Fire Emblem.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg"></figure><p>Xenoblade Chronicles 3, my 2022 Game of the Year, has a few things in common with Sandfall Interactive's hit. The chemistry between characters, emotional cutscenes and storytelling, and highly customizable combat made it one of my favorite RPGs in recent memory, and those are all things that make Clair Obscur great, too.</p><p>Xenoblade 3 features a cast from two opposing sides, their factions locked in constant war to fuel the lifeforces of entire colonies. Each generation of soldiers "hatches" into the world as a prepubescent child and lives up to 10 Terms, with each Term roughly translating to a year of life. If you happen to survive the full 10 Terms, you're rewarded with a ceremony that frees your soul from the cycle of rebirth. Mio, one of the main characters, is on her 10th term and nearing the end of her lifespan.</p><p>Like the premise suggests, grief over friends lost too early (like the protagonist's childhood friend, Joran) and anxiety about the finiteness of life (like with Mio) are two main themes that Xenoblade 3 shares with Clair Obscur. It doesn't explore these ideas through blocks of exposition, but with cinematics, starting with a lengthy opening that introduces us to our main characters. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-masters-of-war/1900-6417921/">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review</a>, we praised many of the same elements that made Clair Obscur a success.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4545886" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4545886"></a><figcaption>Xenoblade 3 is a JRPG that uses this wild setup instead of the typical turn-based combat that the genre is known for. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg"></figure><p>Clair Obscur's Act 1 hooked me with its rich worldbuilding and emotional stakes right away. Gustave, our first playable character, says goodbye to his estranged sweetheart during the annual "Gommage," the time of year when everyone of a certain age fades into smoke and petals. Clair Obscur's is a society where death is predictable and coming closer every year. It strikes early with the reality of how short the average lifespan is, how many children are prematurely orphaned, and similar sadnesses that define life in the fictional French-inspired city of Lumiere.</p><p>These are heavy themes. It doesn't feel like we're playing pretend when we experience these stories of sacrifice and loss. Xenoblade 3 and similarly styled Japanese RPGs also explore these, yet seem to have a hard time getting the mainstream audience to take them seriously.</p><h2>The problem with anime</h2><p>Many Japanese games feature animated graphics like we see in anime, which are Japanese cartoons. Japan uses anime-style drawings for visual instructions, advertisements, and more outside of the typical children's TV show. Japanese developers often adapt the same art style into their games, and unwittingly, attract the same xenophobia foreigners have toward anime. It may be difficult to imagine in today's culture where <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/why-is-anime-cool-now/" rel="nofollow ">anime is now cool</a>, but old fans from the ‚Äò90s and early 2000s remember an era where liking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-anime-go-from-nerdy-cringey-mainstream-deepa-d-souza/" rel="nofollow ">anime was "cringey."</a></p><p>When it comes to anime-style games, the internet is quick to point out any <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/357204-xenoblade-chronicles-3/80068225?page=3">unnecessary sexualization</a> and overused archetypes. These criticisms aren't limited to turn-based games, but also action RPGs, visual novels, and really anything that comes out of Japan. Despite similar issues arising in Western games, these conversations feel more intensified with Japanese titles, and ultimately give them a bad name.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545893" data-ratio="0.56338028169014" data-width="1420" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545893"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 7 Remake has its emotional moments in its storytelling, though you'd have trouble believing it with the memes out there.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg"></figure><p>Common tropes and portrayals in Japanese media are a tougher sell for western audiences that aren't used to them. They laugh at unrealistic behavior like "anime grunts" in Final Fantasy games. (Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a big offender, enough that someone made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpEd2yK8KzQ">movie-length compilation of anime grunts</a> just from the cutscenes.) Others question the absurdity of how often <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/j2pgy2/how_common_is_the_teenagers_killing_god_trope/" rel="nofollow ">high schoolers are fighting god</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-child-soldiers-such-a-popular-concept-in-manga-anime" rel="nofollow ">fighting wars with neighboring countries</a>. Tropes like that <em>can </em>work with the right implementation, and lean into the tastes of people already used to anime games and shows--but if you're not already on board, the themes can be lost in translation.</p><p>Even Clair Obscur game director Guillaume Broche senses that there's some kind of prejudice against Japanese RPGs. He didn't point to a particular reason, but he addressed it in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-says-turn-based-rpgs-are-selling-better-lately-but-the-prejudice-is-still-there/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>.</p><p>"Personally speaking, I think Japanese turn-based RPGs were super popular up until the Xbox 360 era. But around the time open-world games started getting more popular through gaming media, [JRPGs] started being considered 'uncool'," said Broche. "While they do still sell a large number of copies, with the Persona series as a prime example, I feel like the prejudice against turn-based RPGs isn‚Äôt completely gone."</p><p>In Xenoblade 3, some characters have more out-there qualities, such as cat ears, wings, gray skin, or glowing veins--but none of these are used to fetishize them. And while you could argue that stereotypes like the hotheaded, brawny guy and calculating, studious tactician are present, they never feel particularly trite like they may in a C-grade harem anime. But, because of these quirks and the larger stigma, nobody talks about Xenoblade 3 the way they do Clair Obscur. Part of this could be Clair Obscur's presentation, which leaned more into Western aesthetics and had the benefit of being a debut game without specific expectations. Meanwhile, Xenoblade Chronicle 3's marketing focused on it being part of an established series, and showcased chaotic combat (not turn-based) that didn't fully reflect the actual experience. Perhaps all these had a small hand in why it was forgotten, despite its impressive cinematics and compelling story of grief.</p><h2>Japanese-inspired</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545877"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy X is an inspiration to many modern RPGs, including Clair Obscur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg"></figure><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17041-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-celebrating-turn-based-games-classic-rpg-influences-in-making-something-new" rel="nofollow ">RPG Site</a>, Sandfall Interactive co-founder and Expedition 33 producer Fran√ßois Meurisse spoke about his and Broche‚Äòs shared love for JRPGs. Meurisse cited Final Fantasy X and Persona 5 as the team's biggest influences--FFX for its story and P5 for its gameplay. It bears noting that both of these are Japanese games.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-x-review/1900-2832771/">Final Fantasy X</a> launched in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and later came to other consoles as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, starting with the Japan-exclusive launch for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013. Our original PS2 review gave it 9.3/10, admitting it used "typical role-playing game clich√©s" but also, in most cases, "cleverly avoids whatever expectations you may have for it." (Like with Clair Obscur, Xenoblade 3 fans also draw connections between the two.)</p><p>Tidus, FFX's protagonist, is part of a team of guardians escorting Yuna, a Summoner who can command superpowered creatures at will, on a journey to defeat the godlike being destroying their world. There's only so much I can give away without spoilers, but FFX features similar turn-based combat and themes of sacrifice. During the mission, Tidus finds out a concerning truth that forces him to accept a major loss for the betterment of their world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545876"></a><figcaption>Persona 5's stylish UI and camerawork helps combat feel satisfying and cinematic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Persona 5 is now considered the industry standard for turn-based games and proves that the battle system is alive and well--not just found in Clair Obscur. While the exact details differ between the games, Shin Megami Tensei and spin-offs like Persona use a turn-based system that empowers players to stack buffs and trigger combos to hit harder and faster. Atlus' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metaphor-refantazio-review-everybody-wants-to-rule-the-world/1900-6418297/">Metaphor Refantazio</a>, which we gave a 10/0 last year in our review, also builds on this turn-based system.</p><p>The Persona series first reached "cult classic" status with Persona 3, which launched about six years after FFX in North America and overlaps with the same themes in Clair Obscur. Like Clair Obscur, Persona 3 is very much about death and is the most heavy-handed Persona game when it comes to portraying it. One of its biggest mottos is "memento mori," the Latin phrase for "remember you will die," and your party members summon their Personas by taking an evoker (read: pistol) to the head. That's all without spoilers for the story, which the community still remembers as a tearjerker that challenges us to think about how we view death.</p><p>Persona 3 was the first Persona game to focus on building relationships with teammates plus potential romances, a popular enough mechanic to make it into Persona 4 and Persona 5. Clair Obscur also does this with its characters, although you can max out relationship levels with all characters without worrying about choosing one over the other. Persona 3 still attracts criticism for its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/ouydha/persona_3s_pacing_made_me_end_up_not_caring_about/" rel="nofollow ">pacing</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/s38rrr/persona_3_is_a_clunky_frustrating_and_repetitive/" rel="nofollow ">repetitiveness</a>, but the crazy thing is that's something people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1ku8iv4/is_clair_obscur_repetitive_or_is_that_the_standard/" rel="nofollow ">complaining about even in Clair Obscur</a>.</p><p>For every success that takes inspiration from FFX and P5, only a few reach enough people to be as talked about as Clair Obscur, even if they receive recognition from critics, awards shows, and their cult followings. I can compare games like Scarlet Nexus, Sea of Stars, and Octopath Traveller 2 all day and still not address what seems to be the real problem: Japanese versus Western tastes.</p><h2>A cultural divide in media</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545879"></a><figcaption>The Hundred Line Defense Academy is one of the recent releases from Too Kyo Games, a Japanese studio created by Danganronpa and Zero Escape developers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg"></figure><p>Clair Obscur is from France, which generally falls under the umbrella of the "West" that includes Western Europe, North America, and Australia. Its killer mimes may be foreign to me as an American, but the photorealistic, live action presentation matches what many of us are used to in the States.</p><p>Anime is becoming more popular in the U.S., but it's still not the norm. Right now on Netflix Japan, the<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/japan/tv" rel="nofollow "> top 10 shows</a> are almost exclusively anime with the exception of Their Marriage (the Japanese title "Shiawase na Kekkon" roughly translates to "Happy Marriage"). The U.S. is the opposite. Our<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/united-states/tv" rel="nofollow "> top 10 Netflix shows</a> are all live action except for the My Melody &amp; Kuromi series (which is, unsurprisingly, also the one I most want to watch).</p><p>And get this‚ÄîClair Obscur is actually not selling that well in Japan. According to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/famitsu-sales-4-21-25-5-4-25">Gematsu</a>, the Japanese are busy with Spike Chunsoft's The Hundred Line: Defense Academy while we're still arguing about which Clair Obscur ending is best. The Hundred Line Defense Academy launched on the same day as Clair Obscur and sold nearly three times the amount of copies. So there's something to be said about the opposite, too. Japanese people like Japanese games, and Westerners like Western games.</p><h2>Why Clair Obscur?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545878"></a><figcaption>Clair Obscur Act 1 crew is best crew in my humble opinion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg"></figure><p>To its credit, Clair Obscur is well-worth celebrating. It gets a lot right, such as how it tastefully incorporates French aesthetics into its main city and weaves its influences through smaller means, like dialogue and cinematography pulled straight from French cinema. However, if we're talking about the other things that made it successful--like storytelling, exploration, and combat--there are many other games that came before it that do those equally well. If anything, Clair Obscur's biggest strength is that it takes the best features from the last decade's best RPGs and implements them in a way that appeals to a larger crowd. But we ought to show respect for the games that came before, even if they are about cartoon orphans fighting big squids.</p><p>Clair Obscur is still one of the best games I've played this year. I just think we should have a more open mind toward "anime games" because they have many of the same things we love, even if they don't have those hi-fi graphics.</p>
