            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' latest release&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has already climbed its way through the publisher's Steam charts, and the co-op action-adventure game is now the second most-played EA game on the platform.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s 24-hour Steam player peak sits at 197,434, which is pretty impressive; it's more than double what predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>achieved, and that game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful in sales terms</a>.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in second place, and while that's certainly an achievement Hazelight and Josef Fares can celebrate, I don't think&nbsp;the game has a hope of beating the first-place record holder given that it's battle royale FPS&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-steam-count-platforming.jpg?itok=ihs7HF-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-steam-count-platforming.jpg?itok=g1XKWRE- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hazelight's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is doing pretty well at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that since&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s Friend Pass allows players to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">enjoy the game with a friend</a> even if they didn't buy it themselves, the Steam numbers don't necessarily translate into hard sales.</p>

<p>Still, the same is true of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>, so it's still a fair point of comparison in my books. It's fair to say that EA and Hazelight have a hit on their hands with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, and I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers climb even higher over the weekend.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry iconoclast and noted Oscars hater Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees you and a friend (it doesn't support single-player, much like the aforementioned games) playing as Mio and Zoe, two writers who find themselves sucked into the worlds they've created and looking for a way out.</p>




<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>features a variety of co-op-focused activities, including platforming, combat, and various wacky setpieces. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Hazelight game, it seems to me.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

<p>Split Fiction upholds Hazelight Studios’ sterling reputation for delivering high-quality voice over work with a polished production. If you’re wondering who provides the voices for Mio, Zoe, and several other key figures, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p>A Way Out and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> are considered iconic because of their co-op-focused action. But I find anything with a Hazelight Studios logo comes with a certain level of quality seldom seen in AAA games. A tight script and endearing characters further enhance the variety of the gameplay. </p>



<p>In years past, Leo and Vincent’s no-nonsense approach in A Way Out caught the eye, and May and Cody’s strangled relationship was painful but engaging. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> introduces the butting heads of Zoe and Mio, and they are backed up by a stellar cast of characters.</p>

<p><strong>Elsie Bennett voices Zoe in Split Fiction, whereas the role of Mio is assumed by actress Kaja Chan.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-kaja-chan">Kaja Chan</h3>



<p>Kaja has recently shifted into the video game art. After several TV appearances, she provided voice over work in CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC. She moved on to have casting credits in Foamstars and The First Descendant, before landing what is sure to be a breakthrough role as Mio in Split Fiction.</p>



<h3 id="h-elsie-bennett">Elsie Bennett</h3>



<p>Split Fiction’s Zoe is handled brilliantly by Elsie Bennett. She built up a consistent video game profile by lending her talents to IO Interactive’s Hitman games. She added more acting credits to her portfolio by providing several voices for Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint and Control, before actualizing the character of Zoe.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-split-fiction">All Voice Actors in Split Fiction</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has over 40 actors and actresses working hard to bring every hero and enemy to life.</strong></p>



<p>From the Mr. Hammer boss to J.D Rader himself, every role has a voice, along with distinct character and personality. According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34996975/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cst_sm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB</a>, the cast has <strong>42 roles in total</strong>. No expense has been spared to ensure Split Fiction is presented professionally and as emotionally as possible.</p>

                <p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that Killing Floor 3, which had been scheduled to release on March 25, has been delayed to an unspecified date later this year. A number of changes will be made to the game both for the new launch date and afterward.</p><p>Chief among those changes is a post-release update that will separate perk classes from characters, letting the two be chosen independently. The initial change to tie your class choice to a character proved to be contentious with some fans, mirroring similar complaints about Battlefield 2042's debut with hero-style classes.</p><p>"With the full support of our parent company, Embracer Group, we're working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel," the studio said in a <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "We can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release."</p><p>Refunds for preorders will <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">vary between platforms</a>. US-based PlayStation preorders will have the option to keep it or cancel, with non-responses being automatically canceled and refunded. Global PlayStation preorders will be automatically canceled and refunded too.</p><p>Xbox will automatically cancel all preorders and refunds are not necessary because the storefront only charges a user's account  7-10 days before launch.</p><p>On PC, Epic Games Store preorders are automatically canceled and refunded while Steam preorders will remain active unless a user cancels and refunds theirs manually.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 is a multiplayer survival horror game. It takes place in 2091, 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2. The mega-corporation Horzine has created a race of subservient and bioengineered zombies called Zeds. Nightfall, a rebel group, must fight back against the Zeds in order to save humanity.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 can be played solo or with up to five other people, and the game offers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-release-date-confirmed-for-march-2025/1100-6528441/" data-ref-id="1100-6528441">cross-play across all platforms</a>.

		<p>After spending the 2010s almost wholly dedicated to the Castlevania genre, it’s time for MercurySteam to test themselves with something a little bit different. Heck, it’s been a good while since they’ve even dealt in three dimensions, after a pair of side-scrolling Metroid games that included the excellent Metroid Dread. The studio is leaping out of that genre as they look to forge their own original IP with Blades of Fire, creating a new alloy that infuses the Soulslike with some fresh and invigorating new ideas of their own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire Preview – The blacksmithing action adventure you didn't know you needed" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgoiKXgYQp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MercurySteam CEO &amp; Game Director Enric Álvarez told us, “We started this adventure four years ago with the guys at 505 Games, who trusted that this was an interesting proposal. It’s an original IP, we own it, and it will allow us hopefully to fly with our own wings, which is something that independent developers are always looking for.”</p>


<p>There’s something decidedly PS3/Xbox 360 about the look and feel of the world that Blades of Fire conjures, but I mean that in the best possible way. It has that style to the fantasy world and characters, but with a modern game engine and level of detail through the environments that feels contemporary.</p>
<p>Our hero Aran de Lira is a blacksmith turned warrior, but you’d be forgiven for thinking that he’s been working out full time at the Chris Redfield School of Bodybuilding – his hands in particular, look like they’re the size of his head! Right at the start of the game, he rescues the young and studious waif that is Adso from being ambushed by the Queen’s Guard, though comes to the commotion just a little too late to save Adso’s mentor and Aran’s friend Abbot Dorin. The pair of them must set off across the lands to battle through the Queen’s forces, rediscover the magic of the Forgers, and ultimately end the Queen’s tyrannical reign.</p>


<p>Key to doing this is Aran’s ability to forge new and increasingly powerful weapons. The Queen’s magics have turned all her enemies’ weapons from metal to stone, so Aran is now the de facto hero to save these lands. The magical hammer he now holds transports Aran to The Forge, a pocket realm where he can craft new weapons in isolation. It’s a fantastically engaging idea, nowhere near as vague as blacksmithing in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, not as obtuse as a rhythm action minigame that you might expect, and instead more of a puzzle that you can take your time over.</p>
<p>It starts with a Forge Scroll, a blueprint for the weapon you’re about to create, and for which you then need to choose and provide the metals, wood and other components needed to craft it. You can choose different metal variants for different parts of a weapon, lending it different attributes from this, trading off strength for speed, weight and durability for stamina depletion, and more.</p>
<p>From there, you need to actually forge the steel, starting with a glowing block of heated metal that needs hammering into shape. This is represented by what looks like a Hi-Fi’s EQ as you move bars back and forth with each hammer blow.</p>
<p>“We found this kind of minigame very close to the reality,” Enric said. “The possibilities it gives you, how hard you strike, the direction you strike, you’re moving metal in reality. So the bars are just a representation of the metal moving in one direction or the other. You always end up with a viable weapon […] the worst that can happen to you is that the weapon doesn’t have any stars, which is something that you don’t want, but it’s very easy to get a few.”</p>
<p>It’s a great active puzzle element; the closer that you get to completely matching the white line creating a higher quality weapon that can be repaired and reforged more times in future. It’s quite forgiving in how it rates your creation, and once you’ve forged a weapon once, you’re able to skip this process and get the same quality of weapon as you’ve made before.</p>

<p>I love this system, and it becomes a kind of surrogate for more in-depth RPG levelling and mechanics, outside of gathering pips of health and stamina, and a light skill tree earned through collecting cryptic Forger cylinders. There’s dozens of weapons in the game, each catering to different styles of play, and you can choose how to apply the rare metals that you gradually gather through the game.</p>
<p>While you can absolutely have a preference, you can’t just main in a single weapon. As you approach a fight with an enemy and lock on to them, they’ll be outlined in green, yellow, red, or a combination of colours. That immediately tells you whether your weapon is going to be effective against them, and if it isn’t, then you will want to switch weapons or even just your style of attack from slashing to stabbing in order to regain an advantage in battle. Basic enemies can often be offed by a single heavy strike or quickly following that up with a quick attack, but for the tougher enemies that you start to face after the opening hour or so, quick-switching to the right weapon is vital, and identifying if stabbing or slashing is stronger is as well.</p>
<p>Enric said, “This is primarily an action adventure game, it is not an RPG. Combat is a central piece and I think that the combat in this game, the fact that you can attack different parts of the body, this is an idea that came naturally from the Forge.”</p>
<p>“If you have a Forge where you can express yourself – I could say I like spears, I’m going to use this steel, I’m going to put the weight on the tip so I can deal more damage. If you have several ways to attack enemies, it’s mandatory that enemies have several ways to counteract that […] so it forces you to think. It’s not just that you get a brand new hammer and just button-mash it. You’re going to be in pieces in seconds.”</p>

<p>There’s a really pleasing weight and heft to the combat here, and some great, individualistic twists on action RPG hack ‘n’ slashing. Yes, it’s stamina-based, and heavier weapons drain this quicker, so you will be slowed if you attack too much without backing off, but regaining stamina is accelerated if you hold to block, putting you in a defensive stance. While blocking is universal, attacks are directional, using the four face buttons to aim for head, each side and from below. Some armoured enemies are without helmets, for example, so you want to aim there, and there’s other enemies that have weak areas as they build up to unleash spores, which you can prevent and deal extra damage by targeting. Heavy attacks are dished out by holding instead of tapping an attack, and some bigger enemies need this for a finishing move or they’ll regenerate and come at you again.</p>
<p>There’s a delightful amount of cartoonish gore throughout. Smashing enemies with a large hammer just obliterates their head with a spurt of blood, arms get lopped off if you land a final blow from the side, and there’s a troll with multiple health bars that will continue fighting, regardless of the limb you remove first.</p>
<p>Beating enemies will gradually unlock their weapons for you to craft – defeat 40 claymore wielding zombies, for example –&nbsp;and they will drop materials upon death, in addition to those you gather from smashing up the environment. Taking these to the regular anvils in the game let you transport yourself to The Forge, and these also act like Soulslike bonfires. If you die, the weapon you were wielding is left behind, and you need to trek back to that spot from the nearest anvil to retrieve it or risk losing it for good. If the game is too challenging, then there’s multiple difficulty levels below the standard one to ease off a touch.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed my few hours with Blades of Fire. The original fantasy setting, the characters, and their voice acting and script all work for me –&nbsp;Aran’s voice acting reminds me of a cross between Matt Berry and Henry Cavill –&nbsp;but it’s really the unique touches for the combat and the puzzle-like forging that stand out. This is definitely one to keep an eye on when it launches in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that upcoming multiplayer-focused zombie shooter&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the game has no new specific release date.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/499441143215293470" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Tripwire says the decision to delay the game was made following feedback it received from&nbsp;a recent closed beta period. That feedback made Tripwire realize it had "missed the mark" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>.</p>

<p>According to Tripwire, the delay will afford the development team time to address some of the most pressing issues raised during the closed beta, including "performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel". Those are some pretty fundamental issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-delayed-zeds.jpg?itok=ImxiDZCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-delayed-zeds.jpg?itok=fDxNUMMj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time in the oven, Tripwire says.</figcaption></figure><p>Tripwire goes on to say that it has the "full support" of its parent company Embracer Group when it comes to addressing these issues, which will come as a relief given that the game was listed as one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">cornerstones of Embracer's 2025 lineup</a>.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't know which of these issues will be fixed by the time of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>'s launch, but that an update which will let you select your perk class and character independently "is planned for post-release".</p>

<p>The studio closes by saying that it intends to show "a more polished version of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>" later down the line, and that more information is coming "when [Tripwire is] ready to share more details".</p>

<p>This is where I'd normally trot out that misattributed Miyamoto quote about a rushed game being bad and a delayed game being good, but given that Tripwire doesn't seem to be able to promise all of the aforementioned issues will be fixed by launch, I'm not sure it's appropriate here.</p>




<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of zombie-slaying shooters.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for release this month</a>, but it now seems we'll have to wait a while before we learn exactly when it's coming. When it eventually does arrive,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach’s release date announcement could be around the corner, as details about several physical editions and pre-orders have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming from reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> (Dealabs), Kojima Productions seemingly has multiple physical editions for Death Stranding 2 in the works. Pre-orders for the game could also be opening soon. The Standard Edition of DS2 will have a physical copy, and the game is said to receive a Collector’s Edition in Europe and North America, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also tells us that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach—Collector’s Edition will cost USD 229.99. However, the contents of the collector’s edition are unknown. Death Stranding 2 pre-orders are expected to begin by March 2025. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, we heard that Hideo Kojima would attend <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-to-share-new-death-stranding-2-details-at-sxsw-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas</a>, and it was confirmed that he would “discuss and share new details” about DS2. The festival will be hosted this Sunday, March 9, and there’s a chance Kojima could reveal details about Death Stranding 2’s physical editions and pre-orders at the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have yet to hear anything concrete about Death Stranding 2 from Kojima since the official gameplay trailer from last year. Kojima has provided subtle teases on his social media platforms since then, but that’s about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Death Stranding 2 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-only-30-40-complete-says-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still planned for 2025</a>.

<p>Developer Tripwire Interactive has announced that Killing Floor 3 has been delayed until later this year. The delay comes just weeks before the game’s planned March 25 release date.</p>



<p>In a length post on <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio says that the game is being “postponed to an undecided date later in 2025”. They say it comes after “taking the time to gather and discuss feedback” from the recent beta.</p>



<p>“[We’ve] realized that we missed the mark,” the developers said. “Our goal isn’t just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you’ve come to know and love.”</p>

<p>They continued: “With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we’re working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it’s too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.”</p>



<p>The studio closed its statement thanking its community for patience and understanding while saying it looks forward to “another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3.”</p>



<p>No information on when a new release date announcement will come was given.  When it does launch, Killing Floor 3 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-went-mad-and-killed-everyone-in-atomfall.1128198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/i-went-mad-and-killed-everyone-in-atomfall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Join me on a violent journey through the English countryside, AKA: 90 minutes with Atomfall, the new survival-action game from Sniper Elite developer, Rebellion. I recently visited a pub in North London to have a pint and some hands-on playtime, and came away intrigued by Atomfall’s open-ended approach to mission design and eerie tone. I also may have lost my mind and decided to attack everyone I saw, including an old lady who likely didn’t deserve it, with a cricket bat. Let me explain why.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every NPC in Atomfall can be killed, from the lowliest grunt to the most important quest-giver. As I sit down to start the demo, I decide that my mission is to test that design. I’ll admit that my approach is inelegant; barely two minutes into my exploration of this digital Cumbria, I clumsily activate a tripwire alarm that results in me having to end the lives of three alerted guards. I do so with the blunt face of a cricket bat, a hefty chunk of wood that’s Christened as my murder partner with a liberal splash of claret.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I later loot a bow and arrow, and being the glutton for archery in games that I am, I quickly equip it. Now I’m set for long and short-range encounters, and so can let Mr. Cricket Bat take a well-earned rest. Nearby, I spot a hulking wicker man, towering over me and waiting to be set alight. I'm not going near that. I've seen how that story ends. Sights like this nod to the folk horror undertones that serve as the bedrock for this region of Atomfall's segmented world, which is made up of multiple “open zones”. It generates a convincingly uneasy atmosphere that only feeds into the larger mystery I’m trying to crack: what exactly happened here in this sleepy, now irradiated corner of England? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My thoughts about such a mystery are interrupted by a rabble of druids, who presumably have something to do with that wicker man. They prove the perfect range finders for my newly-acquired bow. One. Two. Three. They all fall down. "I'M ROBIN BLOODY HOOD", my brain shouts to itself, before I snap out of it and back into my London pub surroundings. I haven’t had a drink yet, I promise. It’s only 10am.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bow feels good to fire. But I’m more interested in Atomfall’s smart approach to stamina. A traditional depleting and regenerating bar is nowhere to be found, instead replaced by a heart rate monitor that increases the more you perform physically taxing actions. Sprinting for an extended period will push you well over 140 bpm, for example, making it harder for you to aim steadily and accurately if you suddenly have to stop and fight. Later, I find a Bow Mastery skill manual that unlocks a perk that negates the impact a heightened heartbeat has on drawing the bowstring back. It’s not exactly the most exciting perk, and a browse through the menus suggests Atomfall doesn’t boast the most complex skill tree suite. However, it does seem malleable enough to tailor your character’s skills to a gameplay style of your choosing if, for example, you’d prefer to specialise in stealth over gunplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atomfall screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With my only achievement so far being a bunch of dead druids, you may rightfully be wondering what my overall goal is here. And, to an extent, so was I. Aimless exploration of the Casterfall Woods region had yet to unearth anything significant, so I follow my only quest lead: a note pointing me in the direction of a herbalist, Mother Jago, who lives near an old mine. Along the way I spot allusions to the greater story at play, as a shimmering, oily swirl of blues and purples hovers over a power plant – the apparent cause of Britain's descent into the post-apocalypse. Nearby, a phone box rings and a creepy voice warns me to stay out of the woods. It’s too late for that, but thanks for the call anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The path is littered with similar small environmental story touches, such as an old boathouse rigged with an unsettling alarm system, the words “get lost” painted across it – a warning the nearby mound of skulls and bones seemingly didn’t heed. There’s an enjoyably uneasy vibe around every corner of Atomfall, with sleepy, leafy forests giving way to creepy zones of terror. Plenty of Fallout comparisons have been made ever since its reveal, but I think Stalker and its recent sequel is a far more apt touchstone, both in terms of tone and game design.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Reminds me of classic point-and-click adventures in the way you’re encouraged to explore every corner of conversation in search of a hint.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Following another druid massacre in which I butcher them and loot their garden center home for herbs (a quick-thyme event, if you will) I meet Mother Jago at her quaint allotment retreat. Dressed in a plum-coloured coat and animal skull and rose-laden hat, she resembles Angela Lansbury if she’d got big into black magic aromatherapy instead of crime solving. But my hopes that she could make Atomfall’s opaque mystery any clearer are immediately dashed – she gives only vague answers to my questions, despite exhausting every dialogue option as I dig for clues as to where to go next. This reminds me of classic point-and-click adventures in the way you’re encouraged to explore every corner of conversation in search of a hint. Eventually, a door is opened: Jago offers what she promises to be valuable information in exchange for the safe return of her herbalism book. A book that is, of course, not in a library, but held hostage at the druids’ fortified castle. So, with a new lead in my notebook, I traipse back across the map in search of recipes and the druid blood protecting it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Atomfall’s freeform design means I’m able to approach from any angle, and so I decide to attack the castle from the side. As I make my way there I encounter a druid patrol near an abandoned petrol station. The surely soon-to-be-considered historic Battle of the Forecourt kicks off as I lob my only grenade into the middle of them. The enemy AI isn’t the most reactive, rarely darting for cover or really engaging in any evasive maneuvers, but the satisfying eruption of blood and bits of bone does alert a couple of archers from further down the road. I put a halt to their advance with a nail bomb and then proceed to slalom their arrows, quickly closing the distance so that I can snap one’s neck before getting my trusty bat out for another round of head-smashing. There’s definitely fun to be had playing around with these enemies, but from the small sample I’ve had so far, I wouldn’t go into Atomfall looking for top-tier combat. Instead, it seems wise to treat enemy encounters more like a fun sideshow to the main event of discovering the world’s secrets.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After sniping a couple of axe-wielding brutes I make it inside the castle’s outer walls. There I stumble across a locked hut. A note printed with a set of map coordinates pinned to its door suggests that the keys are far away to the southeast. Atomfall doesn’t believe in objective markers, instead leaving it up to you to study your map and place down markers on points of interest yourself. Could this locked hut be where the book is hidden? Do I need to go on a quest for this key? My hunch tells me no, and I instead walk up to the central keep’s big front doors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once inside, I find a few more druids to club, but no sign of the book. I hunt around its dank hallways, finding nothing but cloth and alcohol to craft healing bandages with. I spend a good ten minutes searching every corner, but no luck. It’s a further example of Atomfall’s obtuse approach to mission design. You won’t have your hand held here, and the book won’t glow gold with a big “pick me up” sign attached. While it can lead to moments of frustration, I find myself ultimately encouraged by Rebellion’s approach to make something that challenges the player and sticks stubbornly to its explorative, almost detective-like vision.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I find myself ultimately encouraged by Rebellion’s approach to make something that challenges the player.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with the book nowhere in sight, I decide to follow the paper trail and head to those map coordinates in search of the keys I previously read about. Perhaps this would unlock my path forward? The coordinates lead me into the den of a poison plant monster… thing that seems to boil my brain if I spend too long near it. Rifle bullets make minimal impact, and there’s little I can do to prevent my quick death. I reload my save and use my Skyrim bunny-hopping muscle memory to bypass the beast, leaping down a rock face to collect the keys from one of the creature’s earlier victims. I head back to the hut, where I find a shiny new perk point and a smattering of ammo. As you’ll no doubt be aware, none of these items resemble the herbalism book that I’m trying to find.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forlorn and slightly lost, I venture under the castle and deep into its bowels, where the druids concoct their rituals and chemical-fuelled practices. I kill the High Priestess and about a dozen of her lackeys, find an SMG, a recipe for crafting poison bombs, and an atomic battery which seemingly opens up a whole new questline that I simply don’t have time to look into before my demo time runs out. Again, the observant among you will notice that none of these items are the book I’m looking for.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After my play session ends, I’m told the book <em>was</em> in the castle, just lying on a table I must have walked past several times. Before that revelation, though, I start to believe the book simply doesn’t exist. That it is a ruse. A lie. I decide to go back to the herbalist and see if she has anything to say for herself. She doesn't, of course, because the book is real and the quest to acquire it is legitimate. But my own confusion manifests as fully buying into my character’s descent into violence, and so I kill her. She becomes one with her plants in the soil. Searching her body for some kind of hidden “truth”, I find a recipe for something that would appear to help combat the poison swamp monster I encountered earlier. It’s too late for that, but I assume this is the valuable information she was going to exchange her book for. We could have saved a lot of time here, it seems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not that you can shave a huge amount of time off Atomfall’s runtime. I’m told by the developers at Rebellion that you’d struggle to finish the story in “less than four or five hours”, and that most players will take around 25 hours. Quite what will happen within those 25 hours could be quite varied, though. I spoke to someone else at the demo session who went on an entirely different adventure to mine during their time playing, one that started with a crashed helicopter I never encountered and led to a whole new region filled with killer robots and mutants. It appears that even by just skimming the surface of Atomfall, there are many depths, secrets, and mysteries to be found.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Atomfall feels like a game that rewards you the more you indulge in its obfuscated quest design.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wonder if some of the objectives may be too obtuse for some, though. The lack of direction could certainly be offputting, but Atomfall feels like a game that rewards you the more you indulge in its obfuscated quest design. The blurred lines between the side and main objectives add a real peril to every action, with its malleable plot design encouraging each player to tell their own tale and find their own ending and explanation for what has happened here in the irradiated English countryside. I’ll still see the end of the story, despite killing off poor old Mother Jago, it may just be wildly different from yours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, that’s all that I have time to see today. For now, my hands bloodied from the undeserved demise of a herbalist and the warpath I’ve left behind, I decide to engage in full-British mode: take my cricket bat, head to the pub, and wait for this all to blow over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

			<p>The Death Stranding 2: On the Beach release date announcement should be imminent, as information about the game's physical editions, including a pricey Collector's Edition, started surfacing online ahead of pre-orders opening.</p>
<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun revealed in a new<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> report</a> that information about the game's physical editions have started surfacing, suggesting that pre-orders are about to begin, and thus a release date announcement is imminent. Besides a standard edition, which will launch for €79.99 and $69.99, a Collector's Edition will also launch in North America and Europe for the price of $299.99 in the United States. The contents of the Collector's Edition are still unknown at the time.</p>
<p>As the insider estimates pre-orders for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will begin before the end of the month, there's a very good chance that the game's release date will be revealed during this week's special panel at SXSW 2025, which will feature not only Hideo Kojima but also Norman Reedus and Troy Baker who play main character Sam Porter Bridges and villain Higgs, respectively.</p>
<p>Likely being a few months away from the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on PlayStation 5, this would be the perfect time to revisit the first entry in the series and get reacquainted with the series' universe. You can learn more about the game's Director's Cut version, now available on PC and PlayStation 5, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">review.</a></p>

<p>2K has a habit of rewarding its player base for simply playing. WWE 2K25 follows suit and provides regular Locker Codes to enter. If you do so, you get bonuses ranging from in-game currency to gameplay modifiers. Let’s see what March 2025 Codes we can dig up for WWE 2K25.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> lets you be whatever you want: The Face That Runs The Place, The American Nightmare, The Apex Predator, or any other gimmick-infringement-worthy monikers. It has as much content as a WWE game has ever had—plus the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest roster to date</a>!</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter which feature pulls you in providing it gets the job done. To ensure you don’t become a jobber though, keep up with the latest Locker Codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-active-wwe-2k25-locker-code-amp-reward-march-2025">Every Active WWE 2K25 Locker Code &amp; Reward (March 2025)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How much longer will the American Nightmare rule? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Below are the current Active Locker Codes for WWE 2K25 in March 2025. We’ve also been kind enough to provide the exact characters you need to enter as well. </strong></p>



<p>Double-check what you’ve typed if you get an error, these systems can be finicky. If you get it right, you get a nice <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a> reward.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Locker Code</th><th data-align="center">Reward</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">ELITEROCK2K25</td><td data-align="center">Unlocks Mattel “Elite” The Rock</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-wwe-2k25-locker-codes">How to Redeem WWE 2K25 Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>You must venture into the WWE 2K25 Settings screen to find the Locker Codes option. Here, input the codes and redeem your free content.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s some more precise instructions if you’re unsure of what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up WWE 2K25.</li>



<li>Go to <strong>MyFaction</strong>.</li>



<li>Head to the <strong>Live </strong>option on the left when the game mode has loaded up.</li>



<li>Go to the bottom and press on <strong>Locker Codes</strong>.</li>



<li>Enter an Active Locker Code.</li>



<li>If entered correctly, a prompt appears confirming it’s worked and you receive the item!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-expired-locker-codes">WWE 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are no expired WWE 2K25 Locker Codes at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>The above statement is true for now, but the ever-changing nature of Locker Codes ensures it won’t be accurate forever. If you try an Active Code and it doesn’t work, there’s every chance 2K has decided to take it offline.</p>



<p>Remember to always be quick and stay on top of the newest Locker Codes!</p>



<hr>



<p>2K’s Locker Codes scheme is a great incentive for keeping on top of WWE 2K social media. Goodies and boosts at no extra cost are always welcome. If you think we’ve missed any codes, be sure to post them below.</p>
