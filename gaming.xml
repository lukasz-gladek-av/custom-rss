            <p>Borderlands 4 will dial down the toilet humour compared to the previous game, so don't expect any "skibidi" quotes.</p>
<p>Narrative director Sam Winkler described Borderlands 4 as Gearbox's "most ambitious game yet" and said he's happy to "work with some of the funniest people I know".</p>
<p>A response to Winkler's post asked if, judging by trailers, the game will have darker humour, to which he replied: "Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3's overabundance of toilet humor."</p>
<p>He added, in a further response: "I'm not gonna say there's no toilets but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder."</p>

<p>The Borderlands series isn't exactly serious in its tone, but the third game was criticised for its humour. For some, though, this didn't detract from its shooting mechanics.</p>
<p>Reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Eurogamer Borderlands 3 review</a>: "No, it's not a particularly cerebral experience, but nor is it trying to be; while stuffed with gore and violence and frankly infantile humour, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> is a solid shooter with a meaty 30-ish hour campaign, plentiful - if repetitive - busywork, and a colourful cast of hard-to-forget characters."</p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">new trailer for Borderlands 4 was shown</a>, which revealed its new planet and four playable vault hunters.</p>
<p>It's looking plenty outlandish, but the lack of poop and fart jokes will make for a more satisfying release once the game launches in 2024.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">Skibidi Toilet</a> (lucky you), it's a very silly internet animation made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off game Nightreign will feature enemies from Dark Souls, its director has confirmed.</p>
<p>Souls fans certainly spotted some familiar enemies in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Nightreign's reveal trailer</a> at last week's The Game Awards, most notably The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> who rides atop a dragon firing lightning bolts.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477">Famitsu</a>, director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed that a "small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign thanks to the "influence of the Night King".</p>

<p>He added this is to add to the sense of "chaos" that the night brings. It's all part of the parallel universe of Nightreign, which is clearly allowing FromSoftware to nod to its past.</p>
<p>As the Dark Souls social media account teased: "In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>And while Ishizaki specifically mentioned only the Dark Souls series, perhaps Bloodborne and Sekiro enemies could make an appearance too.</p>
<p>Indeed, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">IGN</a> spotted, the trailer includes player characters battling a three-headed creature with an exposed ribcage that appears to be the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls. Further, an official screenshot released by the developer includes a giant spider who could well be The Duke's Dear Freja from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ss_7a6e385e299b4848943daf2c6bc8218c16cd9497.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Is this Freja? | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further, fans have likened the playable character the Duchess to Bloodborne's Lady Maria thanks to her quickstep ability, while Wylder's claw shot resembles the grappling hook of Sekiro. This is certainly more speculative, but judging by the increased mobility of the playable characters in Nightreign, there does seem to be some influence from across FromSoftware's previous games.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also described Nightreign to Famitsu as a dense but short game that condenses RPG fundamentals into a single mission.</p>
<p>Communication with others, meanwhile, will be with pins and gestures to continue the "loose connection" with fellow players established in previous Souls games. There won't be PvP this time, though, and there's no invasion method.</p>
<p>Lastly, within the roguelite structure, if players successfully pass all three days of the game's day and night cycle, they will obtain relics for various boosting effects.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">new sales total for Elden Ring</a>, which has now sold more copies than the entire Dark Souls series had prior to its release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mistwalker's FANTASIAN Neo Dimension JRPG can now be checked out prior to purchase, thanks to a new free demo released by publisher Square Enix on all platforms.</p>
<p>The demo lets gamers experience the game's first few hours and test the multi-dimensional battle mechanics. Moreover, as is customary with post-launch free demos, players will be able to continue their journey as Leo by carrying over their progress to the full game if they purchase it afterward.</p>
<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension initially launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive. However, it has recently debuted on PC and all main consoles (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch), with great overall reception. The game designed by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi scored a nine out of ten in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Instead of attempting to do away with the tropes that have dominated the genre for a very long time, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension fully embraces them to deliver a compelling experience that feels markedly "Final Fantasy" without being an actual part of the series. The story, as a whole, may not be anything special, but the little interactions between the characters, some emotional moments, and the solid combat system, which only improves as the adventure proceeds and the challenge level increases, make for one of the best JRPGs released in the past few years.</em></p>

            <p>A new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has been released to finally tackle issues with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> performance.</p>
<p>A new Balanced graphics mode has been added to combine Quality mode settings (and raytracing) with Performance mode resolution, targeting 40fps. It requires a display capable of achieving 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>The Performance mode has been adjusted for a more consistent framerate, while raytracing in Quality and Balanced modes will have a less noisy image. Perhaps more damning is the ability to switch off the PS5 Pro's PSSR entirely.</p>

<p>PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, is Sony's AI upscaling technology, but it appears to be causing issues for some developers - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/improvements-to-alan-wake-2s-ps5-pro-patch-still-not-ready">Remedy included</a>. Bloober also appeared to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">issues with it for its Silent Hill 2 remake</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">latest patch</a> is available on PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S and PC. On those other platforms, a couple of minor fixes have been implemented as well as other optimisations.</p>

			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently participated in the virtual <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/2024-annual-shareholder-meeting?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annual Shareholders Meeting</a>, answering questions on a variety of topics that involve the corporation's activities. Usually, on these occasions, gaming is largely ignored, being a relatively minor portion of Microsoft's revenues.</p>
<p>However, this time around, Nadella was actually asked about the early ROI (return on investment) on the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and about progress made in 2024 on the overarching gaming strategy outlined by Microsoft. Nadella was very positive in his reply, and he also touched upon some of the brand's changes related to multiplatform releases.</p>
<p><em>I’m feeling very, very good about where we are in gaming. In fact, right now, this is like the peak season for gaming, obviously with Black Ops and the new Call of Duty, and it’s just been fantastic to see the launch and the marketing around it, the buzz around it and the love for gaming.</em></p>
<p><em>If I think about it, right, we chose the secular growth category in entertainment, which we think is gaming, and said, let’s double down on it, let’s – and it’s been a passion for Microsoft ever since.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, I think Flight Simulator launched before Windows or Office even, and so it’s like one of the longest franchises in this company. And so we said, let’s take that joy of gaming everywhere. And that’s why even these ads with Xbox now, where we are redefining what it means to be an Xbox fan, it’s about being able to enjoy Xbox on all your devices.</em></p>
<p><em>So our strategy with Activision content now is in full force. We feel fantastic about the progress we’ve made. And more importantly, I think, long term, as a company, we can bring the best of AI innovation, cloud innovation, console innovation, PC innovation to build the best games that can be enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards 2024, Xbox fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that another of the former exclusives, The Outer Worlds 2, would launch day and date on PlayStation 5, too, after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/outer-worlds-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> only for PC and Xbox Series S|X back in 2021. It's another hint that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusives-are-gone-for-good-says-jez-corden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> about Microsoft abandoning exclusives for good might be true. While fans may riot at the idea, it certainly makes financial sense, at least on paper.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has stated the company's belief that unique creativity is more important than development costs.</p>
<p>Discussing the rising cost of game development in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">investor Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto admitted the company's development expenses have increased each year. "Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable," he said.</p>
<p>However, creative and intriguing ideas are most important, a view shared by other members of the Nintendo board.</p>

<p>"We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with," said Miyamoto. "With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</p>
<p>As a result, Nintendo aims to nurture developers who "take this unique concept to heart", allocate funds as necessary, and release games "only after we are confident in the product".</p>
<p>Miyamoto added it's "possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs".</p>
<p>"We believe that not all products require large costs," he continued. "Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."</p><p>Senior managing executive officer and corporate director Shinya Takahashi commented: "I believe unique titles that are small in scale, but worth polishing can be created by expanding on the ideas of a small number of developers, rather than spending large sums of money on every game. While overall research and development costs are rising, there are certain products for which expenses remain relatively stable, depending on our approach."</p>
<p>Ko Shiota, senior executive officer and corporate director, added the merging of home console and handheld console for the Switch allowed Nintendo to integrate its development environments, which will continue with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Because we are already familiar with Nintendo Switch, maintaining a similar basis for development environments in the future will allow us to carry over the experience we have already built, which should lead to a reduction in research and development costs over time," he said.</p>
<p>The investor question follows high profile and expensive flops from the past year, including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> from Warner Bros. and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-initial-development-deal-was-reportedly-200m-though-its-financial-and-human-cost-was-far-higher">cancelled Concord</a> from Sony.</p>
<p>Nintendo, meanwhile, is gearing up for its Switch 2 launch. While reports have suggested its graphics could be comparable to the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the ability to run Unreal Engine 5, its specs are likely to be less powerful.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In this modern world of £700 consoles and iterative updates it’s easy to forget the extra expenses involved in gaming – especially when it comes to controllers. When even basic controllers cost upwards of £50 apiece, any kind of local multiplayer becomes extra expensive. Multiply those costs by the various competing consoles and you have a wallet-busting experience. Gamesir have become increasingly engaged in the console and PC accessory space in recent years and their latest controller promises to solve the dilemma of multiple expensive controllers by offering one that works across PC, Switch, and mobile gaming, at an accessible pricepoint.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir Tarantula Pro - Pro by Name, Pro by Nature | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20y-q2OJBag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Multi-format controllers are not a new idea. My 8Bit-Do Pro is my go-to for Switch and emulation but the Tarantula offers a few new tricks and has swiftly become my main choice for PC gaming. Opting for a Playstation layout with two parallel analogue sticks at the bottom of the controller, the Tarantula feels immediately familiar and comfortable in the hand. The sticks themselves are TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) – an even more precise magnetic system than Hall Effect – rather than the more widely used potentiometer system and feel far smoother and more responsive than the main console competitors. The huge advantage TMR has over traditional controllers is the lack of moving parts subject to drift – a factor that is a real blight on both Xbox and Playstation pads. Alongside the sticks we have a mechanical D-pad that feels satisfying to use.</p>


<p>The default button layout for the Tarantula echoes the Xbox standard and even shares the colour coding system. However, one of the coolest options here is the ability to switch between controller profiles and adjust the button layout accordingly. Holding the mode button and the requisite face button operates the mechanism that changes the button layout to the alternative Switch standard. This mechanism is visible through a transparent section and is the kind of satisfying design that would have Alan Partridge purring.</p>


<p>Other than the transparent window revealing the gears that work the switch mechanism the controller has a dark camouflage pattern that is unobtrusive if a little underwhelming. There are RGB effects across the pad as well as the illuminated button layout but the colours and brightness of these are easily adjustable if you want a plainer controller. Aside from the main face buttons there are multiple programmable buttons that by default act as Start and Select (or the system equivalent). The increased options available through these buttons are an interesting addition but I didn’t really find myself using them that much.</p>
<p>More useful are the programmable back buttons that are becoming a more popular choice on controllers. Even better here is the fact that you can lock them using a physical switch and prevent them from being pressed accidentally. The increased functionality on the back of the pad continues with more physical switches that can adjust the triggers to be either analogue or microswitched. This is a really nice addition as it enables the controller to be quickly altered to suit different genres with the microswitches being perfect for shooters and action games whilst analogue better suited to driving games.</p>

<p>The Pro version that I’ve been using also comes complete with a nifty charging stand that sits nicely on my gaming desk and keeps the pad ready for action. It can be connected via USB-C if preferred as well as offering both Bluetooth and dedicated dongle connection. I opted for the latter and have had no issues with latency or lag throughout my time using it.</p>
<p>So far so positive, and as mentioned earlier the Gamesir Tarantula is my new main PC controller but I did encounter some odd problems when trying it out on Switch. Initially connecting the controller didn’t work unless the Switch was in handheld mode – a weird glitch as that is not really the ideal use case for a pad. Once the connection was made however it remained connected on the Switch mode and could be used without issue. I’ve decided to carry on using my 8Bit-Do pad for Nintendo gaming but that’s more to do with my own addiction to multiple controllers than anything being particularly wrong with the Gamesir pad. The instructions link to a Gamesir app but this appeared to only be in Chinese and didn’t seem to include the pad under review at time of testing.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gamesir Tarantula Pro is a fantastic pad that can work across multiple devices and offers a comfortable and responsive option. The Playstation layout may prove to be a divisive choice but for those that prefer parallel controls this represents a perfect solution for PC, Switch and mobile gaming. Even without the many hidden tricks and programmable buttons, this pad comes highly recommended.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Game Science’s CEO and founder, Yocar-Feng Ji, recently discussed Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Yocar-Feng Ji took to the Chinese social media platform, <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his dissatisfaction with Black Myth Wukong losing out on GOTY at TGA 2024. Feng Ji first spoke about how the award ceremony came along simultaneously with their ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatively large update</a>‘ for the title and how this project has spanned 7 years. He then talks about how the game was nominated across four categories and won the Best Action Game and Players’ Voice award, with the latter being more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji reveals that he had “a sense of loss and regret” (as translated by ChatGPT on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PS5</a>) with Wukong not winning GOTY and states that the games nominated “were all exceptional”. However, he “can’t determine the criteria” for GOTY this year. Feng Ji said that he feels he came all the way to Los Angeles “for nothing”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji added that he was very confident about Black Myth Wukong winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024, so sure that he had written his acceptance speech “two years ago”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Black Myth Wukong has been a massive success for Game Science, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a> and breaking several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player records on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Black Myth Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed China’s gaming industry to new heights in 2024</a>. Also, check out the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boss Rush update</a> for the game.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-unlock-kappa-dark-times/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tarkov-event-rewards-players-with-the-game%E2%80%99s-most-coveted-item.1063113/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has started a new pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov, and it rewards players with one of the most coveted, cherished items in the game’s ecosystem: Kappa.</p>



<p>The Kappa secure container is one of the items that the game’s most die-hard fans aspire to unlock after every wipe (read: game reset). It takes a huge amount of effort to grab one, but after completing this relatively simple quest from Battlestate Games, you can get your hands on one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-temporary-greatness">Temporary Greatness</h2>



<p>The only drawback to this event is that you’ll lose Kappa when the game wipes in the coming weeks – but for those weeks, you’ll feel like a legend. Typically, each new wipe brings around a ‘race to Kappa’, with many streamers participating to see who can unlock the aspirational item the fastest.</p>



<p>It’s a beast of a task that requires collecting several rare items and completing dozens of in-game quests. The average player will never get within sniffing distance of Kappa before the game wipes, which is an event that takes place around once every six months.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-kappa-in-tarkov">How to Unlock Kappa in Tarkov</h3>



<p>To get Kappa, you’ll need to complete the new ‘Dark Times’ quest, given to you by Fence, one of Escape from Tarkov’s traders.</p>



<p>Dark Times requires players to venture into Factory at night and kill 30 targets using nothing but a TOZ-16, one of the game’s most cumbersome and pointless weapons. That being said, if you put the right ammunition into it, there’s no reason why you couldn’t get this task done in just a few raids.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you need to eliminate 30 <strong>targets</strong>, and not just PMCs. That means you can run in, blitz through fields of Scav enemies, and then hey presto, you’ve unlocked Kappa for the remainder of the wipe.</p>



<p>Have fun while the secure container is in your possession – it’ll be gone soon. Perhaps the added stash space will motivate you to chase Kappa next wipe, who knows?</p>

<p>In a blog post on the Call of Duty site, Activision has expressed what’s next for Team RICOCHET, the providers of COD’s anti-cheat mechanics. The post addressed the launch of Black Ops 6 and the subsequent release of Ranked Play, which was marred by an influx of cheaters that made grinding a miserable, impossible experience.</p>



<p>In a line, the team admitted that the anti-cheat systems used in Black Ops 6 simply weren’t good enough.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-missing-the-mark">Missing the Mark</h2>



<p>In the blog post on the COD site, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, <strong>we did not hit the mark</strong> for the integration of RICOCHET Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 – particularly for Ranked Play.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On social media, pro players worldwide were lamenting the state of Ranked Play, revealing clips showing them constantly brushing up against cheaters and malicious operators.</p>



<p>Further to the statement above, Activision went on to mention the obvious:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, several key changes are now being implemented. In addition to the 19,000 accounts already banned, the team is promising ‘increased velocity’ on suspensions, to kick cheaters from the game much faster. Team RICOCHET has also started to provide ‘further training’ for AI-based detection systems.</p>



<p>RICOCHET’s kernel-level driver and server-side protections are set to receive some serious upgrades that’ll be deployed alongside Season 02 and Season 03 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december#:~:text=After%20a%20series%20of%20updates,01%20%E2%80%93%20particularly%20for%20Ranked%20Play." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post was closed</a> out with a request to keep reporting cheaters whenever you see them because, after all, there’s only so much these automated systems can do.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Balatro Dev Takes To Social Media To Reflect on 18+ PEGI Rating]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-dev-takes-to-social-media-to-reflect-on-18-pegi-rating.1063104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro secured the award for the Best Indie Game of 2024 at The Game Awards, a success that came just after the game shipped more than 3.5 million units. It has been a great year for Balatro, which was pieced together by a solo developer by the name of ‘LocalThunk’.</p>



<p>Recently, LocalThunk took to social media to rue the PEGI ratings change that was applied mere weeks after the game hit the market in February 2024. On Twitter, he compared Balatro to games like EA Sports FC, suggesting that he could drop his 18+ rated game to a 3+ rating if he added loot boxes and microtransactions to his game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-red-logo-looks-kinda-dope">‘The Red Logo Looks Kinda Dope’</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that LocalThunk doesn’t disagree with the 18+ PEGI rating that was given to his game in March 2024. He’s more ‘irked’ by the games that are given a lower rating despite having similar – or ‘worse’ – mechanics.</p>



<p>He uses EA Sports FC as an example, pointing out that they feature real gambling in the form of loot boxes and other, similar microtransactions. For the longest time, courts worldwide have debated the existence and purpose of loot boxes, and some territories have banned them entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since PEGI gave us an 18+ rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC</span></p></article></div>







<p>After posting this message on Twitter (now ‘X’), LocalThunk wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just to clear it up – I’m way more irked at the 3+ for these games with actual gambling mechanics for children than I am about Balatro having an 18+ rating</p>



<p>If these other games were rated properly I’d happily accept the weirdo 18+. </p>



<p>The red logo looks kinda dope</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=balatro&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-HRGPPBlRm8v8y6E9psaIxVdwU7I9vn_KrpZcbPWoxww&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PEGI platform</a>, the strong rating is justified by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game teaches – by way of images, information and gameplay – skills and knowledge that are used in poker. During gameplay, the player is rewarded with ‘chips’ for playing certain hands. </p>



<p>The player is able to access a list of poker hand names. As the player hovers over these poker hands, the game explains what types of cards the player would need in order to play certain hands. As the game goes on, the player becomes increasingly familiar with which hands would earn more points. </p>



<p>Because these are hands that exist in the real world, this knowledge and skill could be transferred to a real-life game of poker.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Balatro is one of 2024’s strongest games, and it has pulled in remarkable reviews throughout the year.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s an inherent issue with games like EA Sports FC receiving such low ratings despite featuring loot box-like mechanics? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 reached its highest ever concurrent player peak this past Sunday, confirming to all that the iconic first-person shooter from Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very much not dead</a>. This peak came less than 24 hours after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trophy was lifted at the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>.</p>



<p>While this latest peak isn’t the highest in the history of Counter-Strike itself, it’s an incredible accomplishment for CS2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upward-trajectory">Upward trajectory</h2>



<p>The Counter-Strike 2 player peak reached 1,740,261 concurrent players this past Sunday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. This is the highest number of concurrent players on CS2 ever, roughly 180,000 more than the peak that was set when the sequel officially launched in September 2023. With the exception of June and July, the concurrent player peak has gone up every single month of 2024. Both monthly concurrent player peaks and player averages are up now compared to where they were when the year began.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new CS2 player peak did fall a few hundred thousand players short of the all-time peak set in May 2023. The all-time CS2 player peak of 1,818,773 concurrent players was brought on by both the release of the BLAST Paris Major viewer pass and the ongoing CS2 limited test. CS:GO player numbers jumped following the CS2 limited test announcement as players tried to increase their hours in hopes of getting access.</p>



<p>The Major typically brings in more players throughout its duration, as players make Pick ‘Ems selections, redeem souvenir packages, and open sticker capsules. Following Team Spirit’s victory, the players’ championship autographs will become available for purchase soon.</p>



<p>Despite widespread player concerns about the amount of content and the state of anti-cheat, among other issues, CS2 is showing no signs of slowing down or a diminished player count. It still remains the most actively played game on all of Valve by a considerable margin, and that likely isn’t changing anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/recent-magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-one-ring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has updated its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> ban list. The tabletop publisher routinely updates this list, affecting many different play formats for the popular card game, to help maintain a healthy competitive community. But the newest ban includes an iconic item from Middle-earth: The One Ring.</p>



<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast informed players about the upcoming <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list update. For those that play Standard, Vintage, Alchemy, Historic, Timeless, and Brawl format, no changes have happened.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-split-twin-artwork.jpg?itok=PbNyOwD1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-split-twin-artwork.jpg?itok=PSx8eSau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for Modern players, a number of cards have been added and removed from the ban list. Wizards of the Coast state that Modern needs the most help. This is fair considering the last major shake-up happened in August with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-nadu-from-modern" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the banning</a> of <em>Nadu, Winged Wisdom</em>.</p>

<p>This latest <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list includes the popular card, The One Ring from the Universes Beyond set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-revealed-for-lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth</em></a>.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the precious card has been used in a wide number of deck strategies in the competitive scene. It's a colorless artifact, allowing to work with any color deck, provides creature protection and the ability to draw cards, providing a card advantage. Finally, it synergizes well with the current dominant strategy of Modern: Boros Energy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-armed-raptor-artwork.jpg?itok=BHRiyjMT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-armed-raptor-artwork.jpg?itok=VmooHq-Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition to one of fantasy's most iconic artifacts hitting the ban list, <em>Amped Raptor</em> and <em>Jegantha, The Wellspring</em> are banned from Modern play. The reason for these bans all relate to making Boros Energy strategies less viable in the current meta.</p>

<p>But some cards are coming off the ban list with this decision. Four cards will return to Modern: <em>Mox Opal</em>, <em>Green Sun's Zenith</em>, <em>Faithless Footing</em>, and <em>Splinter Twin</em>.</p>

<p>According to Wizards of the Coast, the competitive scene of the game has changed so much, the strategies leading to these cards bans aren't as viable anymore. Hopefully, this leads to continued health in the current meta.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of recently-announced virtual pet simulator game Catly has responded to allegations that the game's trailer and marketing was produced using generative AI, saying that no such technology was used in its announcement at The Game Awards, nor in the game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement shared with IGN, a PR representative authorized to speak on behalf of developer SuperAuthenti said that generative AI was not used to produce the trailer, nor the game. Furthermore, the representative said the developer was "very surprised by such speculations," adding that "We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PR representative also showed IGN a version of the trailer from The Game Awards that showed in-progress shots interspersed alongside the final version, which did seem to confirm the lack of AI use in the actual trailer production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the PR representative said that other allegations suggesting that Catly was a blockchain game were similarly unfounded. They said that there has been "zero blockchain technology" involved in Catly or the company behind it, SuperAuthenti, and similarly there are no NFTs. "Our company/project has never issued any blockchain currency and any NFTs. Our company does not and has never owned any blockchain currency and NFTs."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Catly Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The spokesperson confirmed to IGN that Catly is being made in Unreal Engine 5, and said the developer uses "various software" to produce hyperrealistic fur and hair. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assertions that Catly was using generative AI technology began to circulate almost immediately after its trailer debuted at The Game Awards last week. The trailer itself featured hyperrealistic cats with brightly colored fur and features bounding around a fantasy playspace and interacting with a human wearing various detailed, high fashion outfits. The art style present was flagged by many critics as reminiscent of the hyperrealistic style often produced by generative AI. That said, Catly's statement is consistent with the current reality that game trailers of this quality are not within the reach of current generative AI technology without significant, obvious artifacting and other issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, others pointed out that while the trailer may be legit, the other aspects of Catly's promotion are still giving some off vibes. For instance, the game's Steam description awkwardly reads, "A Cat Open World, with Beautiful Cats. Hyperrealism, Actions, Cuddle, Speed, Islands, Fashion, Dreams, Snow, Robots, Plants -- all with and via Cats."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a few of the game's promotional art pieces had odd details similar to AI artifacting, such as the odd paws and nose of this cat:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/catly-tga-poster-1734378475267.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And the text on the wall inside the right-hand side of the building in this image:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/catly-scenery-poster-1-1-1734378505910.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/comment/m1zej2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unearthed more images</a> from the official Catly website that have since been removed, but which appear to raise even more questions about their veracity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 5:57pm: </strong>A previous version of this story claimed the website had been down all weekend, but the URL for the official website provided to IGN was incorrect, and the website has remained live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While SuperAuthenti confirmed to me that it did not use generative AI in either the trailer or the game itself, it did not respond to my question about its promotional images on Steam or on its website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for web3, speculation of the game's ties to the technology surfaced as individuals unearthed the studio co-founder, Kevin Yeung's, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/catly_has_direct_ties_to_ainftblockchain_gaming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ties to other blockchain games</a>. Additionally, the game's Steam page features a glowing quote from League of Legends and Arcane producer Thomas Vu, who himself is a prominent web3 investor. However, it also contained a quote from Hearthstone and Marvel Snap creator Ben Brode, who has taken to Bluesky to say that he's heard nothing about either AI generation or web3 involved in Catly, and that his interest is sincere. "I saw 20 [minutes] or so of gameplay footage a few months back and thought it looked cool so they asked me for a quote," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3ldbyrd72z22h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it does seem that SuperAuthenti is telling the truth about the Catly trailer at The Game Awards, though the question of whether or not, or how much, generative AI has been used in Catly's overall development and promotion remains to be seen. Generative AI is becoming an increasingly popular tool for game companies, too. Call of Duty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">reportedly sold an "AI-generated cosmetic"</a> for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in late 2023, and fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">accused Activision of using generative AI again for a loading screen this year</a>. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">AI was "the very core" of its business</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, as the technology becomes both more prevalent and more complex, it seems likely it will become increasingly difficult to tell the difference between AI-generated and human-crafted work. In Catly's case, we'll have to wait for 2025 to find out more about what exactly is behind those hauntingly rainbow cat eyes from the trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>A crossover between Helldivers 2 and the Killzone franchise has seemingly been leaked, potentially featuring new armor and weapons.</p><p>According to Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1867412305195282746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1867412305195282746%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iron_S1ghts</a>, the crossover is reportedly called Righteous Revenants Warbond. The user has been datamining the game for months on end, and has previously leaked the designs of the new enemy faction, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellDiversLeaks/comments/1c7cyq1/illuminate_adept_mage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Illuminate</a>. There are <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1867659467573412075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1867659467573412075%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two screenshots</a> floating around showing some of the alleged armors. They have Killzone's iconic gas masks and red eyes that give them their signature sinister look.</p><p>One of them is called AC-1 Dutiful and its passive ability provides 50% resistance to fire, gas, acid, and electrical damage. The other one is called AC-2 Obedient, which has the same passive ability, but offers less protectional in exchange for more speed and stamina recovery. Sony has not made any official announcement yet.</p><p>Arrowhead Studios said earlier this year that it'd be open to crossovers but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devs-are-open-to-crossovers-but-only-if-they-make-sense/1100-6522756/" data-ref-id="1100-6522756">"only if they make sense."</a> Given that Helldivers 2 and Killzone both have fascist themes, this particular crossover seems like a great match. Another potential match could be between Helldivers 2 and Halo, but Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-x-helldivers-crossover-probably-never-happening-arrowhead-ceo-says/1100-6523285/" data-ref-id="1100-6523285">that it would probably never happen.</a></p><p>Helldivers 2 recently added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-major-update-goes-live-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528445/" data-ref-id="1100-6528445">new faction called the Illuminate</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-crush-illuminate-invaders-in-under-a-week/1100-6528505/" data-ref-id="1100-6528505">players have crushed them in under a week.</a> A limited-edition <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-limited-edition-dualsense-controller-revealed-preorders-live-december-20/1100-6528458/" data-ref-id="1100-6528458">Helldivers 2 DualSense controller</a> will also be available for preorder starting December 20.
