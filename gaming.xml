			<p>One of the most surprising announcements of Gamescom 2024's Opening Night Live is the announcement of Mafia: The Old Country. While a new Mafia game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/">been rumored</a> for quite a while, it wasn't officially announced what it could be. Today, 2K and Hanger 13 officially revealed the new title that will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crDUx5suLm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additional details about this upcoming game will be unveiled in December 2024, potentially when they release news on the official release date in 2025 or show off the game play.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country was announced with the game set in a stunning vista of 1900s Sicily. In this game, you will uncover the origins of organized crime as you uncover a gritty mob story about the brutal underworld in Sicily. You have to fight for survival in a perilous and punishing era, with action brought to life with authentic realism and detailed storytelling.</p>
<p>This takes the Mafia franchise to a completely different part of the world, with the previous Mafia games being set in various periods throughout America.</p>
<p>"Across the first three entries in the Mafia franchise, we introduced players to the world of the Mafia through brutal stories set in different eras. In Mafia: The Old Country, we're going back to the roots of what fans love about the franchise, crafting a deep, linear narrative with that classic mob movie feeling, visiting a stunning new setting, and delivering it all in a tight, focused package perfect for fans of immersive experiences," says Nick Baynes, President of Hangar 13.</p>
<p>Mafia was first initialized as a franchise, with the landmark game released in 2002. Since then, the Mafia franchise has taken off, selling more than 34 million copies across console and PC. The games are highly rated by both critics and fans, with specific praise for the rich narrative development, performances from the actors, and great attention to detail to ensure the game is period-appropriate.</p>
<p>If this game has sparked your interest and you want to explore the Mafia franchise, now is the perfect time. All released games in the Mafia franchise are on Steam until September 2.</p>
<p>So far, Gamescom 2024 has shaped up to be a big event for 2K. Tonight, on the first big day at the Gamescom convention in Germany, they announced Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 and gave fans a release date for Civilization 7.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has been delayed yet again, pushing the troubled RPG into the first half of 2025. Publishers Paradox Interactive and developers The Chinese Room say the delay will allow them to continue to polish the game, respond to feedback, and expand on its story.

<p>Paradox announced the news with a video featuring Alex Skidmore, creative director at The Chinese Room, and Mattias Lilja, deputy CEO at Paradox.

<p>"Earlier this year, Paradox reaffirmed our commitment to delivering high-quality games to our players, and the launch update is a proactive decision derived from this commitment," said <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/whats-next-for-bloodlines-2">a statement accompanying the delay</a>. "Though the game is in a good enough place that we could have maintained our planned release window, Paradox and The Chinese Room collaboratively decided to prioritize polish."
</p>
<p>The announcement seems designed to reassure the waiting public that the game is on the home stretch, with only "polish" to be done, but in this case polish isn't limited to bug fixes but also seems to include additional content, more story, more endings, diversified clan combat, and more. 
</p>
<p>Paradox have had a rough year, stretching from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">$22 million flop of Lamplighters League</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">buggy launch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">rushed DLC</a> of Cities Skylines 2, the last-minute <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">cancellation of Life By You</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">indefinite delay of Prison Architect 2</a>.
</p>
<p>Those stumbles led to Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester to admit the company had made the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-ceo-admits-company-made-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-in-wake-of-life-by-yous-cancellation">"wrong calls" in several major projects</a>, while reporting falling profits.
</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2's history isn't any happier. Originally aiming for release in 2020, its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">creative lead was fired</a>, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">was taken off its developers</a>, and it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">resurfaced only last year at The Chinese Room</a> after a supposed period of secret development. It continues to look barebones in every trailer in such a way that any delay seems inevitable.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/they-don%E2%80%99t-make-anime-like-they-used-to.959082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I, like many of you, grew up watching anime. I'm old enough that we didn't even call it “anime” at the time--the term didn't really start to take hold until the late 80's--but my childhood was defined by <em>Macross</em> and <em>Transformers</em>, my teens by <em>Akira</em> and <em>Patlabor</em>, <em>Neon Genesis</em> and <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, <em>Royal Space Force</em> and OK you get the idea.</p><p>From my earliest TV-watching memories through my teens, I could not get enough of that shit. I once dragged my parents around Melbourne's Chinatown on a holiday just to get a <em>Neon Genesis</em> poster. I paid an <em>embarrassing </em>amount of money to import a <em>Macross Plus </em>soundtrack from Japan on CD. I wore home-made t-shirts with iron-on anime transfers and had an extensive collection of bootleg tapes (and later DVDs). I was in deep, but like I said, I was far from alone: many of you reading will probably have similar origin stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Memories (1995) || Cannon Fodder - Blasting The Cannon Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-OQFslDKiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Where my story might differ from some of yours, though, is that once I hit my 20s my love for anime fell off a cliff. Not because I'd got older or somehow outgrown it; I still wanted to love anime, but as the 90's rolled into the 2000's I started finding less and less of it that really got its hooks into me. The stuff I'd been into when I was younger just didn't seem to be getting made anymore.</p><p>Which is fine– that's culture, baby. Nothing stands still, everything is always in motion. Generations ebb and flow like the tides and, like movies and music, anime was no different. I knew this, and I accepted it, but also...a part of me wishes it wasn't the case. Not for nostalgia's sake, I am not a classical statue profile pic fascist who wants to <em>go back</em>, I just think a lot of the stuff I watched as a kid was excellent in ways that a lot of modern anime could be, but simply doesn’t want to be, for whatever reason.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RoyalSpaceForce - Invasion Scene HD (Spoiler)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3l3yEGblTj8?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I could have simply left this blog here: An old man yelling at the clouds, pining for the Good Old Days. But that would be boring. Also, as you can probably tell by now, while I was an anime enthusiast, I am not an anime <em>expert</em>, so what the fuck do I even know about what trends are, what shapes them and what everyone is watching today as a result. So instead of settling into middle age and saying goodbye to anime forever, I decided to speak with a bunch of people who <em>are</em> experts, first to try to find out why they don't make the stuff I like anymore (or if that's even true), and then while I was at it, see if there is anything around today that I <em>would </em>like, and which I might have missed given my relative distance from the medium.</p><p>(I should say here that in more recent years I've watched and loved <em>Cyberpunk</em>, <em>Yakitori</em>, <em>Knights of Sidonia</em>, <em>Blame</em>, <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> and most of <em>Attack on Titan</em>, so it's not like I've simply gone cold turkey).</p><p>First up is<strong> Austin Walker</strong>, formerly of Waypoint and Giant Bomb and a ton of other stuff, who I basically asked: why don't we get anime with cool machines and sinister Cold War politics anymore?</p><p>"You've already ID'd half of why they don't make things like this anymore", Walker says. "We aren't in the late Cold War/early neoliberal malaise anymore, we're in something else, with its own aesthetic register. That register is (in part) less mechanical and more digital, less clicky buttons and switches, more touchscreens and voice-commands.</p><p>"And, wouldn't you know it, that shift happens right around when cel animation is replaced by 'digipaint' style anime in the 2000s. It took artists a lot of time to adjust to this new technique, and I think the mood and aesthetic you're talking about here were <em>harder </em>to achieve early on in this shift (though there are definitely examples of it now). You can literally see it happen in, for instance, the shift from <em>Big O</em> season 1 to season 2. Both happen to be late instances of the aesthetic you're talking about, but so much of what makes the show visually spectacular is lost in the transition to digital. <em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em>, similarly, is an early digipaint show and despite it being excellent (especially in the first season), it leans into a brighter, 'post-cyberpunk' aesthetic space that fits the strengths of that technology and what artists in that era were able to do with it."</p><p>Basically, Walker says, the world went from one using hardware to one using software, and anime's aesthetic inspiration followed. "And then, as CG has filtered in to supplement and then replace that tech, it's happened again."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Macross Plus Anime Aesthetic //  Vestron Vulture - Hair on Fire" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkUVkuRFGPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I asked a similar question of <strong>Toussaint Egan</strong>, curation editor at Polygon. Just what was going on in Japanese politics and society in the 80's and 90's that influenced anime so much, and did that play a part in my favourite examples of the medium--most of which he sums up as part of a genre called "Real Robot"--drying up as times and politics changed?</p><p>"You mentioned a prevalent tone in anime productions during the late 70s-mid 90s", Egan says. "I personally believe this is attributable to a combination of factors, among them the rise of the Real Robot aesthetic, and with it an emphasis on more 'gritty,' grounded human stories during the late 70's, the uncertainty in the wake of the bursting of the bubble economy in the late 80's, and a general sense of existential apprehension regarding the impending end of the 20th century."</p><p>Take <em>Patlabor </em>(1989), for example, one of my favourites. Egan says the film's underlying inspiration was anxiety about land developers and corporations "mowing down old neighborhoods in a race to create new commercial spaces and housing for wealthy clientele", while <em>Patlabor 2</em> (1993) was influenced instead by global politics, in particular "existential questions concerning Japan’s sovereignty, especially regarding Article 9 of Japan's post-WWII constitution, the nature of the JSDF, and its then-recent deployment in international UN operations in Cambodia."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【机动警察PATLABOR 2】自卫队政变（JSDF Coup d'état）" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_Bg4SQvhXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Those were poignant issues for the time, but times change. "A lot of folks point to 1995’s <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> as the inflection point at which Real Robot aesthetics peaked, and I happen to agree", Egan says. "Regardless of whether or not someone wants to argue if <em>Evangelion </em>was necessarily a 'deconstruction' of mecha anime tropes, it is a series that took the Real Robot concept to its ultimate conclusion: by taking the concept of mecha as non-biological apparatuses that augment and extend biological human capabilities and went so far as to depict the mecha themselves as living, bio-mechanical hybrid entities. <em>Evangelion </em>took the aesthetic touchpoints and philosophical foundations of Real Robot mecha and pushed them until they broke."</p><p>Which more than answers my questions about the underlying politics of that time period, but as Austin mentioned, that big cultural shift in anime coincided with a technological revolution as well. The anime from my childhood had a feel, but it also had a <em>look</em>, so what effect did the advent of digipaint have on anime from the 2000's onwards?</p><p>"The majority of anime doesn’t look the same way that it did before the turn of the century because of the industry-wide transition from traditional cel animation to digital paint and ink, or digipaint", Egan explains. "The amount of anime produced yearly now eclipses what was produced in previous decades before the turn of the century, and that’s attributable in no small part to the transition to digipaint.</p><p>"However, that efficiency comes at the cost of what many anime viewers would describe as the 'vibe' of pre-2000s anime; the particular color palette and hues, background art designs, and subtle character acting details that were attributable to the physical hand drawn and painted process behind cel animation."</p><figure></figure><p>To help explain how these seismic shifts took place on a <em>personal</em> level, how there were changes in the people making popular anime and their own experiences, I turned to <strong>Isaiah Colbert</strong>, my former colleague at Kotaku who is now an anime freelancer for places like IGN.</p><p>"Ultimately, it boils down to a sign of the times", Colbert says. "Modern-day animators are not wholly concerned with the existential in terms of tech and war. They are more concerned with the personal, i.e., mental health and interpersonal relationships with anime like <em>A Silent Voice</em>, <em>Your Name</em>, and <em>Belle</em>. Creators and anime creators are kind of in a period where flashy animation and compositing in shows like <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> and <em>Demon Slayer</em> are the de jour."</p><p>Those are prominent examples, but they're not the rule. There have and always will be weightier anime, with <em>Pluto</em> being a recent example, though even that has caveats. Colbert says, "<em>Pluto</em>, like works from auteurs like Hayao Miyazaki, has the distinction of being helmed by an animation veteran like producer Masao Maruyama. Having a stalwart vet like Mappa, Studio M2, and Madhouse founder Maruyama---who has been in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pluto-netflx-anime-astro-boy-anime-expo-2023-interview-1850600279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business for 60+ years</a>---gives shows like <em>Pluto </em>the sensibilities to create a show that wrestles with politics, war, machines, and apocalyptic affairs from his lived experience."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="PLUTO | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ez8lm9I26Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Colbert points out that Tatsuki Fujimoto, creator of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, has recently lamented figures like Hayao Miyazaki becoming a dying breed in Japanese animation.<a href="https://shueisha.online/articles/-/146972?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> In a 2023 interview</a>, Fujimoto said many modern creators, brought up as "otaku", are only interested in making derivative works of Japanese media that already exists, while veterans like Miyazaki were able to draw on a more varied, lived experience.</p><p>"This isn't to say that detailed and atmospheric art is hard to come by in anime", Colbert adds. "But anime probably won't ever have that same kind of panache as a <em>Patlabor </em>or OG <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, unless it has someone from that era on its production committee to have enough sway to let those projects harken back to that era. Otherwise, those visual motifs and ideals will probably be dictated as an homage or reference in a more future-focused project more concerned with digital futurism than analog artifacts. This is a nicer way of saying an iPad baby can't be expected to see a world bigger than what's in their immediate surroundings."</p><p>Egan believes this generational shift isn't just a result of what's happened with creators and studios from inside Japan, but has been impacted by an increasing foreign influence on the medium as well.</p><p>"American-Japanese co-productions of anime are becoming more prevalent, and this is having a marked effect on what kinds of anime are greenlit", Egan says. "Anime creators aren’t just creating anime for domestic audiences anymore, but international audiences. That’s not to say that they didn’t consider them before — but now, it’s not just a matter of guesswork. They’re getting clear feedback and direct responses from broadcasters and streaming services who aren’t just competing for broadcasting rights from pre-existing projects, but actively commissioning projects themselves. They’re following international trends, which currently favor adaptations of serialized manga that have already proven to have an established readership and pre-existing fanbase. Those manga happen to skew within genres like supernatural shonen, isekai, romance, or sci-fi action. Mecha just isn’t one of those genres right now."</p><p>OK, so that mostly answers my query as to why I have trouble finding anime that I like in 2024. But like I've said, I'm no expert, and as I've drifted away from the medium there's a very good chance I've missed out on stuff I might otherwise have been into. Series like <em>Cyberpunk </em>and <em>Yakitori</em>, for example, might not be <em>exactly </em>my thing, but there's enough overlap on their venn diagram for me to enjoy them.</p><p>For help here I asked <strong>Kate Sanchez</strong>, EiC of But Why Tho?, anime writer for places like Paste<em> </em>and Polygon<em> </em>and a Crunchyroll anime awards judge, for some recommendations based on the stuff I used to be into.</p><p>"I think when it comes to finding new anime, there are so many new ones that it makes it hard to find the genre or type that you're looking for", she says. "Additionally, robotics, cyberpunk, and mechanical anime have become less of the focus unless it's mecha. Oftentimes, it's all held in a general sci-fi category, which sometimes makes it hard to figure out if it has what you're looking for.</p><p>"We're in a resurgence of original mech anime right now, but I would say the 90's and 2000's were probably when it was at a peak moment. But it is still here, the love of machinery isn't gone yet. I think science-heavy and technical anime is an important element that you could explore when looking at all of the intersections. I think the realm of cyberpunk anime may have more detailed machinery that you're looking for. Not to plug my own site, but we did a <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2020/10/looking-for-more-cyberpunk-check-out-these-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyberpunk manga list</a> a while ago, and that was actually the first time looking at the art that I thought about the high focus on mechanical details."</p><p>Kate's recommendations included:</p><p>Ergo Proxy:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ergo Proxy Trailer HD &quot;Pulse of the awakening&quot;" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWI97Kg8ur8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>No Guns Life:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="No Guns Life | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQyWoG43kRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Kuromukuro:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【KUROMUKURO】Promotion Video [Official English Sub.]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIOgBRsCsUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Fafner:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fafner - The Complete Series - Available on BD/DVD Combo 9.18.12 - Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yqsbemrzlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And, for a steampunk twist, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQ9VjFBqfH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>OK, so that's a lot to get through! I'm going to be spending months doing so, and all the while I'll probably be kicking myself for limiting my scope so narrowly all this time, clinging so tightly to one era's anime while largely ignoring what came after. But I'm also extremely grateful for the advice and assistance given by all these experts, down to some parting perspective on the whole thing from Austin.</p><p>"We're older, and we've already experienced decades of first time exposure to these things", Walker says. "When we saw all those things--the androids' hands opening up to speedtype in the first <em>GitS</em>; the truth of what was hidden below Nerv HQ; Tetsuo giving way to a bulging mass of flesh and rage--they were groundbreaking, fresh ideas. Today we live in a world made by those images. And I have to imagine that younger viewers are having similar experiences with things that land flatter for us. In fact, I know they are, because I see them posting about it.</p><p>"I don't know that these two big ideas are in direct conflict. I think being a media consumer in 2024 is exactly about being stuck between these two pressures: Overwhelmed and disoriented by what's on offer. Sure that something has changed, though unclear on what specifically did. But able to, if we're lucky and persistent, dig through the chaff to find exactly the thing we're looking for."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new co-op combat spectacle-style game has been revealed at Gamescom 2024. This game is being developed by Glowmade and published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-shown-in-the-not-too-distant-future-says-amazon-games-boss/">Amazon Games</a>, titled King of Meat. It's a chaotic, hack-and-slash online co-op for up to four players, where you must become a fearless contender as you battle through high-intensity dungeons with ridiculous traps.</p>
<p><iframe title="King of Meat – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CICrUbma4o0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game takes place in Loregok, where players are taken to a place where they will encounter dragons, trolls, skeletons, and corporate commercialism. High fantasy meets glitz, glamor, and media infatuation with modern-day celebrity in this wacky game. If it isn't apparent by now, the obsession is the survival game show that you participate in, named King of Meat.</p>
<p>All of the dungeons you run through take place in the Komstruct Koliseum, where you entertain the local people. You play a character desperate to seek glory, gold, and fame. Not only do you have to fight for your life against the traps and obstacles that block your path, but there is also every kind of monster imaginable to try and stop you in your tracks.</p>
<p>While you're fighting for your life, you must try and impress the obsessive crowd by using flourish in your combat skills and showmanship as you traverse tricky dungeons filled with lava, spinning blades, rotating spikes, and much more. While that may sound over the top already, there are also inter-dimensional black holes, exploding ducks, and giant horse hooves designed to stop you in your tracks.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you want to get stuck into, you can check out the new trailer for King of Meat that premiered during Gamescom Opening Night Live below. King of Meat will feature a UGC dungeon building and will be available for digital purchase, with the game launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1926980/King_of_Meat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>At the moment, King of Meat has no planned release date, with the Steam page saying "coming soon." However, we will surely hear more about this wacky party game in the future. If you don't like being the contender yourself, you also have the option to torture other people by creating your Dungeons for people to play through and try to survive against the vicious traps and intuitive tools you have utilized.</p>
<p>In addition, you can customize your character however you like and choose your outfits, accessories, and emotes to show off your confidence as a contender in King of Meat.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Techland revealed a new instalment of the Dying Light series at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase. It’s called ‘Dying Light: The Beast, and it’ll see the first game’s protagonist, Kyle Crane, make a return to the franchise. It’s a standalone title with around 20 hours of gameplay in an all-new setting, and it’ll feature cooperative gameplay and vehicular elements, much like the first game’s ‘The Following’ expansion.</p>



<p>However, it was subsequently revealed in a press release that The Beast will replace the long-awaited second DLC for Dying Light 2, which was released in February 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-and-better">Bigger and Better</h2>



<p>Per the press release issued by Techland:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Development of Dying Light: The Beast originally started as a story DLC for Dying Light 2 Stay Human. But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that in mind, Techland will make The Beast available to owners of the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2 free of charge. It’ll be a standalone purchase for anyone else, though.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known when Dying Light: The Beast will be released, but Techland’s brief <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story trailer released earlier</a> today revealed something worth waiting for. It’s not a <strong>full game</strong> in the series, but it’s a handsome expansion that’ll bring back a fan-favourite character.</p>



<p>In Dying Light: The Beast, players can lean on Kyle Crane’s previous infection, using the ‘powers of the undead’ to their advantage. It takes place in a more rural region than players are used to, but in the tight-knit map, there are still some urban patches to explore, and once again, parkour mechanics are front and centre. </p>



<p>Are you excited to see Kyle Crane again? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Sound familiar? Anyone who’s played Fable, one of the many games from Molyneux’s much-loved back catalog, will know Albion well.</p><p>Albion is the setting for the Fable series, originally developed by legendary UK studio Lionhead before Microsoft shut it down in 2016. Microsoft is currently working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-fable-reboot-shown-off-with-new-trailer-and-a-2025-release-window-xbox-games-showcase-2024">a brand new Fable game</a>, in development at Forza Horizon maker Playground. So, is Masters of Albion a Fable game?</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-a-new-spin-on-fables-world-from-its-original-creator-gamescom-2024">a new interview with IGN</a>, Molyneux explained his thought process:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“So Albion is the old English name for England and Wales and Cornwall. And I think it's a really interesting world. It's an interesting universe that Fable touched upon and really I think Albion in Masters of Albion, it extends and expands that, but it's not actually Fable 5 or anything like that.</p><p>“But if you've played Fable, then definitely Masters of Albion will be familiar to you. One of the things that we have got and we absolutely wanted a nail was the humor and a lot of what the humor is. I think in the Fable games, it's not so much about telling jokes, it's more about giving you the ability, the player, to do ridiculous and funny things. And we've got that in Masters of Albion in absolute spades really. I think we're really nail that.</p><p>“So there's a lot you can do with your hero, which is very funny. Some of it can be very cruel, some of it can be very kind. There's a lot you can do with your hand that can be kind and cruel. And I really love the detail that we can go into.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Albion can't be copyrighted. It's the name for England and Wales and that's how we get away with it.</p></div><p>IGN followed up to ask, directly, whether the Albion in Masters of Albion is the Albion players have explored in the Fable games.</p><p>Molyneux replied:</p><p>“Yes, yes. Fable was set in Albion, Masters of Albion is set in Albion.”</p><p>But how? Surely Microsoft might have something to say if Masters of Albion is set in the Albion from Fable?</p><p>Molyneux said Albion as a setting doesn’t belong to anyone.</p><p>“Albion is like saying if you set a game in America, you can't set any other game in America,” he said. “So Albion can't be copyrighted. It's the name for England and Wales and that's how we get away with it.”</p><p>It sounds like the Albion in Masters of Albion isn’t exactly the Albion in Fable, then, rather yet another humor-filled fantasy take on old England.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking of Fable, we asked Molyneux how it feels to see another company make a Fable game, following Lionhead’s demise.</p><p>“I'm fascinated to see what Playground does with Fable,” he replied. “I'm absolutely delighted that the franchise is continuing to grow. I mean, that makes me so proud, to be involved with the brilliant people that made Fable and we made something that was worthy for someone as brilliant as Playground to make it.</p><p>“I hope they make it their Fable. I hope they keep the humor, the trailers that I've seen so far look stunning. But I'm curious about the gameplay and I'm curious about what their Fable looks like and plays like and feels like, as opposed to what Lionhead would look like and feel like. What an incredibly diplomatic answer that was!”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/20/screenshot-2024-08-20-123711-1724153853177.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Peter Molyneux. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Peter Molyneux is one of the most controversial video game designers around, with a reputation for over-promising and under-delivering across his career. He created the seminal god games Populous, as well as the likes of Dungeon Keeper and Theme Park while at Bullfrog.</p><p>After founding Lionhead, Molyneux worked on Black &amp; White, the Fable games, and The Movies, as well as a number of canceled projects. Molyneux left Lionhead in 2012, following the completion of Fable: The Journey, to work at new studio 22cans.</p><p>22cans itself is a highly controversial studio, with god game Godus failing to leave early access on Steam. Molyneux was also heavily criticized for failing to make good on a promise to change the life of the winner of experimental mobile game Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube?</p><p>Now, after something of a hiatus, Molyneux is speaking to the press once again to talk about his new game.

It's still a bit abstract and removed, but they have more vibrancy, detail, and movement than before.</p><p>2K Games</p></figcaption>  </figure>

  



      <p>2K Games provided a flight from Chicago to Baltimore and accommodation for two nights so that Ars could participate in the preview opportunity for Civilization VII. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</p>
    
<!-- cache hit 37:single/related:3112d6a26bbfea4ba545a5a8b2b4fce9 --><!-- empty -->
<p>From squares to hexes, from tech trees to civic trees, over its more than 30 years across seven mainline entries, the Civilization franchise continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Firaxis, the studio that has developed the Civilization games for many years, has a mantra when making a sequel: 33 percent of the game stays the same, 33 percent gets updated, and 33 percent is brand new.</p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to play <em>Civilization VII</em>, the next entry, which is due to launch in February 2025. The build I played was an early alpha build, but the bones of the game it will become were there, and it’s interesting to see which third Firaxis kept the same and which third it has reimagined.
</p><p>It turns out that the core of the game that its developers won’t much want to change is the turn-to-turn experience. But in the case of <em>Civilization VII</em>, all bets are off when it comes to the overall arc of the journey from sticks and stones to space travel.</p>
<h2>Rethinking the structure of a Civilization game</h2>
<p>Most of the time, playing <em>Civilization VII</em> feels a lot like playing <em>Civilization VI</em>—but there’s one big change that spans the whole game that seems to be this sequel’s tentpole feature.</p>
<p>That’s the new Ages system. The long game is now broken into three segments: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Each Age has some unique systems and gameplay, though most systems span all three.</p>
<p>Within each age, you’re given a handful of “Legacy Paths” to choose from. These map closely to the franchise’s long-standing victory conditions: Science, Economic, Cultural, and Military. The idea is that you pick the Legacy Path you want to pursue, and each Legacy Path has different success conditions that change across each of the three Ages.
</p><p>These conditions are big and broad, and Firaxis thankfully hasn’t gotten too jazzy with them. For example, I played in the Age of Antiquity and pursued the Cultural path, so my goal was to build a certain number of Wonders before the end of the Age.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>In some ways, this is similar to the boom-and-bust cycle of Dark and Golden Ages in <em>Civilization VI</em>, but I found it much more natural in <em>VII</em>. In <em>VI</em>, I often found myself making arbitrary-seeming choices I didn’t think made sense for my long-term strategy just to game the system and get the Age transition I wanted. In this new game, the Legacy Path objectives are likely to always be completely in line with the overall victory strategy you’re pursuing.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of this new structure is support for shorter games that aren’t just hyper-compressed versions of a larger game. Previously, the only way to play a game of Civilization that wasn’t a dozen or more hours long was to pick one of the faster game speeds, but that fundamentally changed how the game felt to play.</p>

<p>Now, <em>Civilization VII</em> gives you the ability to play a match that’s just one Age, if you choose to.</p>
<p>The new Ages system is integrated with another big change: your choice of leader and civilization are no longer tied together when you start a new game, and they’re not set in stone, either.</p>
<p>Now you pick both a civilization and a leader separately at the start—and you can do some weird, ahistorical combinations, like Greece’s Alexander as the leader of China. Each leader and civilization offers specific bonuses, so this gives more customization of your playstyle at the start.
</p><p>It doesn’t end there, though. At the end of each Age, you can essentially change civilizations (though as far as I could tell, you stick with the leader). Firaxis says it took inspiration for this feature from history—like the fact that London was a Roman city before it became an English one in the Medieval era.</p>
<p>Which civilization you can transition to is dictated by what you did within the Legacy Path system, among other things.</p>
<p>The amount of time I had to play the game was just enough to <em>almost</em> finish the Antiquity Age, so I didn’t get to see this in action, but it sounds like an interesting new system.</p>

GeForce Now subscribers have been able to sync their accounts to use PC Game Pass and Microsoft Store titles on the service, but this new connection will apparently allow you to set a login that works for supported games.</p><p>This feature is part of a collaboration between Nvidia and Microsoft to try to boost cloud gaming and streaming in a big way. Cloud gaming was also a major sticking point in Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of Activision Blizzard, with the console giant telling regulators that it would allow players to stream games through Microsoft's own streaming service as well as third-party providers like Nvidia. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-stream-xbox-games-in-a-new-way-today/1100-6525093/">recent update</a> let users launch Xbox games directly from Xbox.com via cloud streaming through Nvidia GeForce Now.</p>

			<p>Dune: Awakening was one of the major games showcased at Gamescom 2024, where they announced the plans to release the game in Early 2025. Additionally, during Gamescom, 30 minutes of Dune: Awakening gameplay will be showcased later in the week. Those excited about the game managed to get an exclusive look at the game during Gamescom Opening Night Live, where they got to see a 5-minute exclusive gameplay reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening – Exclusive Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ud3EW5aAUZ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The reveal for <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/">Dune: Awakening</a> shows the player's rise from scavenging and survival to mobilizing an entire guild hunting for spice. Players will explore the scorching desert full of colossal sandworms while trying their hardest to survive the harsh heat. To make their journey more tolerable, players will have to learn the survival instincts of the Fremen.</p>
<p>To also aid your survival, you can expand your influence in many ways throughout Dune: Awakening, including combat, spice flow, and upgrading your bases. You can choose which path to take and develop your character by walking the path of the Mentat, Trooper, Planetologist, Swordmaster, or Bene Gesserit.</p>
<p>You have to try and control the spice to cling to power while warfare rages on around you. You can join a guild and align with either House Harkonnen or Atreides, where you'll then battle each other for spice in dynamic guild battles involving various vehicles, tech, and specialized combatants.</p>
<p>For those who got to experience the showcase of Dune: Awakening at Gamescom in person, you may have seen the towering Sandworm sculpture that led you to their booth, where you can watch the extended 30-minute gameplay presentation. You'll also get to leave with your own Fremkit goodie bag. In addition, journalists and creators at Gamescom will also get the chance to try a demo of Dune: Awakening, where they can then share their impressions with the wider public.</p>
<p>Multiple content creators will also showcase Dune: Awakening's 30-minute presentation over the next few days, with content creators such as Sacriel, Alphacast, and Mowky showing off the gameplay.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening will launch in early 2025 on PC, with the game arriving on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later. To list the game on PC and console, visit the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and sign up. You can enter the closed Beta when it happens.</p>
<p>In addition to the 30-minute showcase of Dune: Awakening, Funcom has announced that a third Dune: Awakening Direct will air on August 29. The direct will showcase more game play footage and some of the game's features, with Soe Gschwind hosting.</p>

The series, <em>Secret Level</em>, is an adult-animated anthology series.

<p>At Gamescom, Tim Miller took the stage to promote Secret Level. Miller was noticeably emotional, stating that the show was a love letter to videogames and to the unique characters and settings to which they belong.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//gLihxsmI_OU"></iframe></p>
<p>The teaser trailer shown at the event contained short snippets of different videogame characters. Notable standouts were a squad of Space Marines from <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>God of War's</em></a> Kratos, the protagonist from the martial arts action game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sifu-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sifu</em></a>, and the five-headed dragon Tiamat from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.
</p>
<p>Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

<p>In Arc Raiders - or ARC Raiders, if I'm feeling generous - you're a survivor in an underground colony. The ARC are deadly machines who rule the surface. As a scavenger, you go on sorties in search of supplies at the behest of traders and quest givers back home, working with or against other players to make it back home with the goods.
</p>
<p>It's now a "$40 premium title", according to Embark. "There are many reasons for this change, and they all boil down to our conviction that a premium business model is a better fit for the type of game we’re building. A premium model allows us to create a more focused, balanced, and engaging action-survival experience."
</p>
<p>Embark are also planning on running a couple of beta tests in the near future, beginning with a tech test between October 24th and 27th. You can sign up for that now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">via its Steam page</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm glad of the change away from free-to-play. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-finals-review">truly love The Finals</a>, but its business model makes its continued existence feel perilous given its inevitably dwindling player numbers.

However, Amazon is the lone retailer that still regularly offers Game Pass Ultimate codes for the price <em>before </em>the last price hike.
