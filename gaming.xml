As the <em>Kotaku </em>staff rolled into Slack, we shared our respective results, and the stark difference between how some of us consume music got two of our writers reflecting on their music-listening habits. They are both wondering if they just listen to music in bizarre ways, or if it’s everyone else who is wrong, actually. You be the judge. But also be nice.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-recommend-id="image://4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Spotify</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-recommend-id="image://4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-minutes-listened-top-artists-1851059532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-minutes-listened-top-artists-1851059532">Spotify Wrapped</a></span>. At least, I do the moment I boot up the music-streaming app and see all the statistics and rankings encompassing a year of listening habits. It’s only when I start seeing other people’s Wrappeds that I feel like I might be slightly insane. I spend every 12 months wondering what I’m going to see in the mirror Spotify holds up at the end of the year, and my 2024 wasn’t particularly surprising in a vacuum. My most played song was Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” because I’m gay and have immaculate taste. Just how much have I listened to the tune since the <em>Short n’ Sweet </em>singer released it in April? 1582 times.</p><p>Friends, I realize that probably sounds excessive. Literally seconds after I posted about my Spotify Wrapped on social media, I was met with reactions from people gobsmacked by how many times I’d heard Carpenter singing about the Nintendo Switch (but not actually). Then, as I scrolled through other people’s Wrapped, I saw the majority of people’s most-played songs had only been played a couple dozen times over the course of 12 months. On top of that, my overall Spotify usage was in the six figures. I spent 129,053 minutes listening to music on Spotify, about three months of non-stop music in my ears. Once again, this dwarfed most people’s average play time, which landed around five figures or less.</p><p>These ridiculous statistics require some context. For one, I always have music playing if I’m not talking to someone, and even then, it’s probably playing in the background. That means while I’m writing for this here website, playing non-narrative games like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, or commuting through New York City, my Spotify is blasting something into my ears. Again, Spotify Wrapped reminds me not many people operate this way, and I simply don’t know how the rest of y’all are white-knuckling life without music. What am I supposed to do, listen to the sounds of NYC traffic jams?</p><p>But my total playtime is probably less surprising than the 1500 listens to “Espresso.” That can be explained by me listening to songs on repeat for hours on end. Sometimes I’ll listen to a song nonstop for a day or two, then move on to something else, then come back to that song for another stretch of relentless listening. The song of the moment is Coheed &amp; Cambria’s “Searching For Tomorrow,” which has had a few of these dedicated windows of repeat listening in the time since the prog rock band released it last month. Is there <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://medium.com/illumination/autism-music-on-repeat-1ac474e184f5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://medium.com/illumination/autism-music-on-repeat-1ac474e184f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possibly something undiagnosed</a></span> underneath there? Could be. But my music-listening habits have always been this way. When I was young, if I didn’t like a full album I’d spent money on, I’d probably have the songs I did like on a loop, and the rise of digital music and streaming services has only exacerbated this approach.</p><p>To be clear, this isn’t exclusively how I listen to music. But over the years, I’ve always sought out ways to listen to songs on repeat. When I used YouTube as a primary music source, I had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://listenonrepeat.com/?v=Y5WQ6gF-8vA#Wel_e_to_ListenOnRepeat_-_World_s_%231_YouTube_Looper&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://listenonrepeat.com/?v=Y5WQ6gF-8vA#Wel_e_to_ListenOnRepeat_-_World_s_%231_YouTube_Looper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external websites open to play songs I was really vibing with on a loop</a></span>. I remember I stopped using Soundcloud as often when they made it impossible to find their repeat button for a brief window of time. Part of it is just my personality. I tend to hyperfixate. Growing up, I used to go see a movie that I enjoyed multiple times in theaters and replay games multiple times without getting tired of them. So it’s natural that tendency would bleed into how I listen to music as well. But part of it is this job. I start to attach certain feelings or games to specific songs or artists, and will listen to them on repeat so it keeps me in the right headspace. Music is so often an extension of my mood that a song landing in my most-listened-to playlist is as much a statement about how I felt that year as it is about the quality of the song.</p><p>“Espresso” was my go-to gym song for much of the year. Since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">moving to NYC</a></span>, I finally made the jump to becoming a gym rat, and I tend to listen to a lot of pop girlies during my workouts because half the reason you go to the gym is to get more confident in how you look. So yeah, I listened to a sexy little pop song half the time because it got me in my groove. Couple that with the song being relatively short (just under three minutes) and it naturally ends up getting a couple dozen plays by the end of the workout. The same goes for Charli XCX and Billie Eilish’s “Guess” Remix. Nothing gets me more pumped for cable flys than a bumpin’ pop song. It’s the same effect metal or hip-hop has on the average straight dude.</p><p>But my top-played artists aren’t all pop girlies, though Sabrina, Charli, and Chappell Roan all ended up in my top five. Yes, yes, I know I’m gay, Spotify. Chill. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/coheed-and-cambria-deranged-joke-single-batman-arkham-1851463330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/coheed-and-cambria-deranged-joke-single-batman-arkham-1851463330">Coheed &amp; Cambria’s “The Joke”</a></span> was my second-most-played song, though Spotify won’t give me a number on how many times it was played. It was the return of my favorite band, and the fact that they managed to end up in my top five artists this year on the back of three singles leading up to their new album next year is a testament to how many times those songs were spun. Jon Bellion, probably my favorite pop artist right now, hasn’t put out an album for six years, so his new, melancholy single about rediscovering his inner child, “Kid Again,” was on loop for several days as I wrung his soulful vocals out for every last drop.</p><p>Eventually, these songs do make their way out of the rotation, but I have been blessed with the uncanny ability to never truly tire of these songs. I remember friends in high school being frankly kind of shitty to me for being able to listen to songs on a loop in my headphones, as if that had any bearing on their lives. Looking back, it was probably less about them being subjected to a song non-stop than it was the idea that someone listened to music differently. I had earbuds in, what did it matter to them what they were playing?</p><p>Without context, my Spotify Wrapped usually looks insane every year. But looking back at the way I listen to music, I try not to read into it too much. I just know everyone who sees it in passing probably wonders how the hell someone can listen to a funky pop song about Not Coffee hundreds of times without wanting to tear their ears out. And to that I say: If you can’t still love a song after hearing it dozens, hundreds, or apparently thousands of times, that’s a skill issue. Sorry. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go put “Espresso” on for the 1583rd time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-recommend-id="image://49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Spotify</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-recommend-id="image://49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Looking at everyone else’s Spotify Wrapped makes me feel like I’m doing it wrong. (If I were being more honest, I’d say that it makes me feel like everyone else but me is doing it wrong, but I won’t admit to that.) As <em>Kotaku</em> writers shared their summaries of their most-listened-to songs from 2024 in our Slack, Kenneth reported that he’d listened to Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” some 1,582 times. My most played song—“Young Fathers” by Typhoon—had been streamed by me 17 times.</p><p>If you asked me to sing “Young Fathers” by Typhoon, I’d have genuinely replied, “Who?” I absolutely wouldn’t have known that was the name of the band, nor even the name of the track, but playing it back, I’m like, “Oh yeah, I really like how this sounds!” I’d added it to my Liked Songs playlist (currently 1,622 songs long) and I guess it came up 17 times over the year. I’ve no idea who Typhoon are, if they’re wonderful progressives championed by the youth, or some problematic bunch of old bastards only liked by actual Nazis. It’s just a song that made a nice noise, so I listened to it. (I’ve got it on right now, and it’s a great pop track, with a whole host of catchy riffs, but I’ve never paid attention to the lyrics.)</p><p>According to Spotify, I’ve listened to a total of 5,232 songs this year, by 1,992 different artists. And, apparently, this isn’t very normal? It kept telling me I was in the top 0.5 percent of various bands’ listenerships, which feels incredibly stalkerish, and confuses me even further given how infrequently I’d apparently streamed any single track. But it’s likely because of this width instead of depth that my top five artists included, in fifth place, Eels.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong—I love Eels. I loved them in 1996 with Beautiful Freak, a CD I recorded to cassette and then listened to on a loop on my Walkman during a summer spent mowing fields in a Scottish outdoor activity center. I loved Electro-Shock Blues (well, as much as that gut-punch of an album can be loved), and the incredible Daisies of the Galaxy in 2000, and Souljacker in 2002, and then…I drifted off. I hadn’t listened to them in 20 years! I spent a couple of days listening to a bunch of their more recent albums, stuck a few of the tracks on my Liked Songs list, and that was that. And apparently that made the band my fifth highest choice!</p><p>The rest of the top five isn’t as surprising to me, even if it reveals that I still just listen to what comic writer and former colleague Kieron Gillen always describes as “John Walker music.” (It’s a derogatory term.) In first place is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marblesounds.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marblesounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marble Sounds</a></span>, and that makes perfect sense. The Belgian singer’s music is my “happy” place, something I put on when I need to feel the perpetual ennui of life reflected back to me in beautiful sounds. Second place is The Mountain Goats, and again, the only surprise is that it’s not first place. Alongside Nick Cave, John Darnielle is my favorite singer, and The Mountain Goats is the band I’ve seen live the most times. If I had to pick only one artist I was allowed to listen to, it’d be him or Cave, depending on the day. Third is Radical Face, and again, that’s a go-to artist for me (alongside another Ben Cooper vehicle, Electric President, with Alex Kane), since I discovered him in 2017 via the extraordinary video-EP, “SunnMoonnEclippse.”</p><p>But from then on, it’s a free-for-all. There are tracks I am convinced I listened to vastly more often than those listed in my top five songs, including whoever Typhoon are. Like French “electro-swing band” Caravan Palace’s incredible ditty “Miracle,” that despite being five years old I only heard for the first time this year via some TV show.</p><p>Also, I’m convinced I listened to A House’s 1994 track “Why Me” more than 17 times on the same day a couple of weeks ago. Although, at least the appearance of “A Wave Across A Bay” in second place for songs represents just how much I’ve listened to Frank Turner this year. If I’d had to guess, I’d have assumed it’d have been the deeply moving song about anxiety, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwxy-JT7Pw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwxy-JT7Pw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Haven’t Been Doing So Well,”</a></span> or his wonderful song “Miranda,” about restoring his broken relationship with his dad (the agreed term between them) after she came out as trans.</p><p>Also, where’s Busdriver? Where’s Aesop Rock? Where’s Nick Cave? Where’s Noname? And the rest of the artists I feel like I put on more often than others?</p><p>OK, I’m done just crowbarring in favorite songs to make you listen to them—I’ll get back to the point…</p><p>As tempting as it is to crown myself as Captain Iconoclastic, having found my own niche of middle-of-the-road middle-aged men to listen to, it leaves me feeling a bit alienated. My wife and son sing along to any song they hear in public, but they’re all new to me. When Kenneth shared his top five, I genuinely asked who Sabrina Carpenter is. It turns out I know the track “Espresso,” and have deliberately listened to it a few times as it’s a great piece of pop, but I had no idea who sang it—even though I remember her lackluster performance of it on SNL.</p><p>When I was younger, I’d have taken dumb pride in this. Ooh, look at me, I don’t even know the big pop hits, aren’t I so <em>very interesting</em>. But as I get dangerously close to 50, I realize that, no, I’m just missing out. Admittedly, this is in large part driven by my wife and son endlessly repeating the same bloody Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan songs, which might be perfectly fantastic, but I’ve involuntarily heard them so many times they’ve become like sandpaper on my brain.</p><p>And I guess it’s that last part that traps me in my weird situation: I don’t want to hear the same song a billion times. Kenneth listened to “Espresso” 1,500 times in a year. That sounds like a punishment to me, and as I already said, I think it’s a great track! But damn, 30 times and I’d not want to listen to it again for a good few years. I want something brand new more than I want an old familiar. As soon as something is broadly popular, I hear it even when I don’t want to, and I begin to resent it. It’s <em>imposed</em> on me. It’s fair to say that with 272 monthly listeners on Spotify, another regular favorite, Trouble Books, aren’t going to be played when I go into the department store. (Listen to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58RFslkOLjQ&amp;pp=ygUYdHJvdWJsZSBib29rcyBncmF2ZWwgcGl0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58RFslkOLjQ&amp;pp=ygUYdHJvdWJsZSBib29rcyBncmF2ZWwgcGl0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Gravel Pit”</a></span> right now, you bastards.)</p><p>So am I the weirdo? Or is it Kenneth? I like to assume that it’s probably both of us, given we felt so compelled to worry about it that we wrote this article.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-the-hero-building-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible is a comic famed for its unusually high levels of gore and character mortality. Back in 2021 it got an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/invincible">animated TV treatment</a>, expanding its fan base considerably and opening the door to other spin off products such as this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>. In the show, the protagonists are teenagers, struggling to learn how to use their powers to defend the world after a massacre of older, more experienced superheros. So here, you get to create them from the ground up in Invincible: The Hero-Building Game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><div catalogid="cf173c02-dce9-4297-8045-212cb71eef3c" id="209856"><div id="209856" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s very much a board game, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game doesn’t have much of a board. Instead of anything fold-out, there are three separate boards that sit next to one another, representing three different areas of wherever the scenario you’re playing takes place. Each has spaces for heroes, villains, minions and civilians. They’re very basic, presumably so that they work as whatever location you’re supposed to be in, but they’re perfectly functional.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assuming you like the style of the original Invincible comic, the remainder of the components are much more engaging. There are standees for the four playable heroes, plus Omni-man, lots of civilian and minion tokens, and multiple decks of cards for things like events, villains and hero powers, all resplendent with licensed comic art from Invincible, although the typography on the cards is a little gauche.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from various cardboard and wooden markers, the other components are related directly to the playable heroes and scenarios, with a tracking board for each of these, again festooned in relevant comic art. With all those panels assembled together on the tabletop, your play area begins to look like a comic book in and of itself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than a point-by-point rulebook, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game walks you through the introductory scenario step by step, and then has an addendum for more advanced rules. This is a divisive approach, but it works well here, allowing you to get into the basics of the game with a minimum of fuss. Everyone picks a hero from the available roster of Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode and Robot, seeds a bag with a variety of colored cubes, and dives in, working together to save the globe from an alien invasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three board areas, each one of which has spaces for heroes, villains and a mass of innocent bystanders, who fluctuate between safe and dangerous zones. On your turn you’ll start by drawing three cubes from your bag and assigning them to your hero powers, allowing you to do things like move, attack, or rescue civilians. Colored cubes have to be assigned to matching color powers: yellow is fighting, for instance, while blue tends to be more about rescue and recovery. Black cubes are wild and can be assigned anywhere, but there’s a catch: you can keep drawing and assigning cubes as long as you like, but if you get more than four black cubes, you’re exhausted and out of the round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve seen this kind of push-your-luck bag-drawing before in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide">Quacks of Quedlinburg</a>, and it’s really fun. By allowing players to control their own risk, it offers a neat balance of excitement and strategy. But it’s particularly good here because most hero powers require more than one cube to activate, meaning you’ve got to be incredibly careful about your priorities. If you really, really want to attack this round, it’s tempting to throw black cubes into your yellow powers, but then yellow cubes drawn are less useful. And on the flip side, if you haven’t quite filled and activated a power when you close in on that five-cube limit, those you’ve assigned will be wasted unless you risk another draw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s superpowered swings and roundabouts and the right choice is situational, depending on whether you’re on the verge of taking out an enemy, or suffering a catastrophic number of civilian deaths. Running it close to the line when there’s a critical outcome on the line is hugely exciting and, as a bonus, it alleviates the common pitfall of cooperative play where the most experienced player directs the others. It’s your turn, it’s your bag, and it’s up to you how risky you want to play it, then down to fate whether you’ll live up to your character’s heroics or blow it for the whole team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After all the players have finished drawing cubes and taking actions, it’s on to the training phase. You’ll each have a hand of five cards representing potential superpowers your teenage hero might learn to manifest. Orange cubes drawn during your turn can be assigned to confidence, which is essentially a currency you can use to buy these cards. This adds a whole new layer of strategy to proceedings as you look for combos between your starting powers, those in your hand and the cubes in your bag, a multi-way mash-up of bag-building and tableau building from an enormous deck of powers, for a colossal amount of variety and strategic flex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fun as this is, it does leave some thematic question marks hanging over the game. While the heroes do grapple with learning their powers in the comic, the idea that it’s a revolving door of different abilities they can try on for size and discard feels like a stretch too far. Similarly, while each hero starts with a signature purple power keyed to their abilities – Rex Splode can damage all enemies in the vicinity with an explosion, for example – there’s nothing to stop you choosing a roster of entirely unrelated powers to go along with it. You could make Rex, who is selfish and reckless in the source material, a caring, sharing support character with lots of healing and buff powers if you so wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible: The Hero Building Game earns back some thematic brownie points in the villain phase. Here, you draw an event card that has different instructions for villains and their minions, which will see them damaging heroes, killing civilians and using special powers, at least until such time as you do enough damage to them to get them off the board. You may also get a boost from some outside help, or include optional challenges like having to zap back and meet shifts at work to make things even tougher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each scenario has a selection of randomly drawn and scenario-specific enemies that enter play as the game progresses, as well as some thematic special rules. The whole package gives each scenario plenty of thematic heft as well as variety for replay value. In the second scenario, for instance, you’ll face the annoying Doc Seismic, who won’t enter play until the final round, giving you limited time to defeat him. And in the meantime, you’ll have to watch out for him accumulating damage to Mount Rushmore, which will lose you the game if it takes too much. Other ways you can lose include an excessive civilian death toll, or too many hero knock-outs from enemy damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To try and avoid this fate, you’ve always got the option to fly back to HQ and rest up, recovering some health and your defiance token, a handy option that lets you re-draw cubes if you don’t like what you pulled. However, doing so takes you away from the frontline, so this is very much robbing Peter to pay Paul, as while you’re away, your team-mates and civilians will be left to face the punishment. But this is typical of the game, which does a great job of keeping the tension high and making you feel like you’re stretched too thin, walking a strategic knife-edge between victory and defeat. And this matches the tone of the comic, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XGoe?object_uuid=b8a983c9-a9b2-4db4-b179-108341944395&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVpj4?object_uuid=b8a983c9-a9b2-4db4-b179-108341944395&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Dire Wolf</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 5, 2024 3:51 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Whatever your feelings on the source material, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game is a cut above its cooperative peers in the board gaming world. Despite a few thematic and presentational miss-steps, it generates a fitting emergent narrative for the comics that it’s based on. Perhaps more importantly, it’s a compelling challenge, with lots of cool combos to dig for in your quest to save the world again and again, thanks to plenty of variety and optional difficulty tweaks. It even manages to encourage genuine cooperation as you work through tactical plans and bring them to the table, leaving the final risk up to the individual. It's an impressive package, which deserves to build its own heroic niche in the wider world of comic book board games.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-reveals-foamstars-next-season-will-be-its-last-but-the-game-will-remain-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix has announced the next season of its live service shooter Foamstars will be the last, though the game will remain online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> revealed the Party Goes On season, which begins December 13 and runs until January 17, will be the final season of Foamstars but Square Enix will continue to support the game in a handful of other ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix will introduce "expansions" that will "enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customise shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Foamstars Cup will also be hosted across a series of events named after each character, which presumably means eight separate events since there are eight player characters in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Foamstars Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy Foamstars, previous Season Passes will be made available again," Square Enix said. "Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this isn't as disastrous a move as a full shutdown which other triple-A live service games have suffered recently, the removal of seasons certainly doesn't bode well for the future of Foamstars. Square Enix only released the game in February, meaning the dedicated live service support that was seasons will come to end less than one year after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foamstars debuted to a middling reception and Square Enix seemingly hasn't been able to turn interest around. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/foamstars-review">It earned a 6/10 in IGN's review</a>, in which we said: "Foamstars' combat mechanics are unexpectedly engaging, but confounding time-gated modes and aggressive monetization make them harder to enjoy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live service games such as Foamstars have had a rough year, with many falling to reach high levels of engagement. The model is so attractive to publishers as, instead of just making a single payment to buy a game, players are given a continuous stream of purchasing options such as battle passes, season passes, and other microtransactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A live service boom of sorts has occurred in the video game industry as a result of incredibly successful games such as Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys, but many publishers have seemingly fallen short by looking to capitalize immediately instead of building up a dedicated audience first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foamstars may be included in this list, though others such as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have also fallen flat. The most infamous live service game of the year, however, and perhaps ever, is in PlayStation hero shooter Concord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It debuted to a tragic 697 peak concurrent players on Steam, a number that made the 12,786 players of the aforementioned Suicide Squad, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">was dubbed a disappointment by Warner Bros. Discovery</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">caused a $200 million hit to revenue</a>, look like a titan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Sony then made the decision to shut down the game less than two weeks after launch</a>, and while some debated a potential return, all hopes were dashed when developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">Firewalk Studios was shut down a few weeks later</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Far from simply updating the game's visuals and adding some modern quality-of-life features, Blizzard is also taking a look at gameplay balance.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZ2jiW95qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Most of the changes in the new <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/warcraft-ii-remastered-patch-notes-101/52999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warcraft 2: Remastered patch 1.0.1</a> are related to resource costs and ability durations for various units. Archers and Axe Throwers have received some significant changes to their upgrades, which are now faster to research, deal more damage, and cost less gold and (in most cases) lumber to learn. Paladins have received some slight buffs, as have Death Knights.</p><p dir="ltr">One huge change players seem happy with is a nerf to the Ogre Mage's Bloodlust ability, long regarded as overpowered for those playing as the Horde and an ability without a good Alliance alternative. The ability doubles the damage and piercing damage of a selected unit for a set duration, allowing Bloodlusted units to cut through even heavily armored foes with ease.</p><p dir="ltr">Post-patch 1.0.1, Bloodlust has had its duration decreased, its mana cost increased, and had its double-damage buff applied after armor reduction instead of before. The ability will still be extremely valuable, but it's at least not quite as omnipotent as before.</p><p dir="ltr">These balance changes are the first major gameplay updates to the beloved RTS since the arrival of patch 2.02 for the 1999 Battle.net version of Warcraft 2. I wasn't able to find an exact date for when 2.02 released, but given the Battle.net version of Warcraft 2's October 1999 release, it likely came a few months later or sometime in 2000. That makes the Warcraft 2: Remastered balance changes the first for the RTS in roughly 24 or 25 years.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the balance changes, the update additionally re-adds the game's classic Victory/Defeat screens and animations, adds an Alliance menu for online multiplayer, introduces countdowns to matches when waiting in a multiplayer lobby, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Classic game storefront GOG recently announced Blizzard would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-delisted-on-gog-december-13-folllowing-blizzard-remasters/1100-6528156/" data-ref-id="1100-6528156">pulling the non-remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2 from sale on December 13</a>. Despite the fact they will soon be delisted, GOG said it would continue to provide tech support for both games to ensure compatibility for future versions of Windows.</p>

For those who already own Caves of Qud, the soundtrack and the DLC pack can be purchased separately.</p><p>Unfortunately, save files prior to 1.0 will not be compatible with the full version of the game.

Leaked gameplay first appeared on YouTube on Thursday, showing the game’s first three hours.</p><p>Even though the video, posted by YouTuber Lone Viking, was eventually taken down by ZeniMax, some of the game's plot points were revealed. Lone Viking said that he purchased the game from a local store, where he paid $80-$100 to get it three days early for the game's basic release on December 8. Official review embargos are expected to lift later today at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET, the same time as the early access.</p><p>What we do know from the game is that Indy has split from his on-and-off-again companion, Marion Ravenwood, and finds himself on the trail of a great conspiracy that leads him through the Vatican, the Sukhothai temples in Thailand, the Egyptian pyramids, Shanghai, and the icy Himalayas.</p><p>Game Pass users can upgrade to the Premium Edition for $35 (or $100 for those buying the full game without Game Pass) to play early and score a few bonuses like a Temple of Doom outfit and a future story DLC, the Order of the Giants. PlayStation owners will have to wait a bit longer to punch Nazis and seek treasure as the game isn't headed to the console until Spring 2025.

And over time, we improve our skills! I don’t think there’s anything wrong with toiling away in quiet obscurity for a time. In fact, it might be beneficial: you can best hear your own voice in the silence, after all.

But throughout the last 2 years, I lost my way. I don’t know what it is (sunk cost fallacy?), but the longer you work on a skill (and the better you get at it), you really start to hope that you can make some money off your passion, turning it into a “side-hustle”. I started measuring my success based on my quantity of Steam “Wishlists” and how much money I might make from the eventual release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My first game, Bass Monkey, was totally free, but I’m still selling Humble Bee for a few bucks. I think I’ve got my head back on straight, but it’s important for me to remind myself that the joy is in the work, NOT THE RESULTS. I mean, recall a time when you had a dream (eg, making your first video game, graduating from school, etc.) that you FINALLY achieved after years of toil. Remember how amazing that achievement felt, FOR ALL OF 5 SECONDS? Humans are wired to WORK. We reach the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/#:~:text=Mihaly%20Csikszentmihalyi%20discovered%20that%20people,which%20involves%20their%20creative%20abilities.">flow state (ie, have fun),</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while concentrating on a task at just the right balance between frustration and boredom.

I don’t know, but 2 years is a long time to work on a project alone (I don’t know how some solo developers go for longer in isolation…) Even though in my last post-mortem I proposed that you should TRIPLE your original timeline estimate. I didn’t heed my own advice. I got “scope-creep”. And indeed, a 9-month project once again ended up taking three times longer than expected (27 months!) It’s hard, and after many “dark nights of the soul” and working on Game Dev every single day (for 10 min to 2 hours per day), eventually the game gets done.

I talked about this in my last postmortem, and I do think that it’s a solid language/engine to start making games quickly. But for this largish-scope 2.5D game (where I had to learn to program all of the jumping physics, collisions, and rendering pipeline to achieve the 3D-ish effect), making the thing just got super unwieldy. Further, since there’s no real official “asset store” to help save time, I can’t seem to find a way around re-inventing the wheel with each game. Next time I’ll be using Unity to make a full-blown 3D game (I’ve tried Godot, Unreal, and Unity over the last several months as a learning experience, which is maybe a post for another time), because I think the unity asset store is an unparalleled time-saver. But any of the options I listed above have much more “built-in” functionality right out of the box for games with more than 2 dimensions. I will probably still come back to Gamemaker for pure 2D games, but I’ll be trying something new with the next game.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Art: Most of the art in The Last Humble Bee came from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://itch.io/">io</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, purchasing and altering asset packs with a CC0 license from talented pixel artists.

One of my favourite anime shows is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlrPO6dBaxw">Sakura Quest</a>. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

Hoshino needs to persuade 100 residents to attend the festival by gathering clues about their "quirks and desires". Some of these clues are found online, care of a gorgeous Y2K web browser that harbours a few minigames. Others must be uncovered using Hoshino's low-key Sherlockian capabilities. "A tossed-aside cigarette butt tells a story, and the fragrant scent of trees hides the sneaky presence of a mosquito," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3107530/Danchi_Days/">the Steam page comments</a>. Confound you, trees! When the day of the festival comes, we will chop you down for firewood. Providing we get permission from the council.
</p><p>
Danchi Days takes inspiration from auld Japanese console delights like Earthbound and Moon Remix RPG, but it's also semi-autobiographical - based on developers sandy powder and Melos Han-Tani's experience of living in a real-life danchi, with art from illustrator mogumu. It's being published by Analgesic Productions, whose other works include the amazing and perpetually overlooked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> games. I'm hoping the new game's apartment block doesn't harbour anything like Anodyne 2's desertNPC.

Keen? It's not out for a while - sometime in 2026. In the meantime, you can catch up on Sakura Quest. Don't miss the multiple episode arc about the fight to extend the local bus route.

<p>Jake Paul is joining the Undisputed boxing roster. Developer Steel City Interactive announced on Thursday that Paul will be joining the game as part of The Problem Child DLC pack on December 12.</p>



<p>“Jake’s influence on modern boxing is undeniable. His meteoric rise has introduced a whole new generation to the sport, especially those who have followed him from a YouTube phenomenon to a legitimate boxing contender,” Founder and CEO of Steel City Interactive Ash Habib said via release.</p>







<p>“I’ve been breaking barriers and making history in real life, so it’s only fitting that I bring the same energy to Undisputed. This isn’t just about being in a video game; it’s about inspiring a new generation of fans to step into the ring—virtually and in real life,” Paul said.</p>



<p>To get Paul into Undisputed, the developers at Steel City Interactive did full motion capture at their UK-based studio. </p>



<p>“The Steel City team nailed every detail, from my moves to my swag, and I can’t wait for players to test their skills,” Paul said.</p>



<p>In addition to Paul, The Problem Child DLC pack will feature six more fighters, including: Zhilei Zhang, James ‘Buster’ Douglas, Otto Wallin, Erik Morales, Marco Antonio Barrera, &amp; Juan Manuel Marquez.</p>



<p>As of writing, no price for the DLC pack has been announced. As far as future additions go, Insider Gaming has heard of a few names the studio has had talks with that were either close to a deal or have signed a deal that hasn’t been announced yet. Paul was one of those names, and there are others that, while can’t be said yet, are pretty obvious fighters to be added in future DLC.</p>

He was hit by a truck and ultimately pulled under it as the driver kept going. "The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. I wasn't gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck," Brandon wrote.</p><p>"At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards."</p><p>After this, Brandon said he felt the full weight of the front end of the truck begin to roll onto his ribs, going on to say he was dragged for about 12 feet. He was taken to the hospital and miraculously only had a single broken bone in his left foot, in addition to some road rash. Not only was Brandon mostly OK from the experience, but his Xbox didn't break either. He said it booted up normally and runs games despite the toll it took and the damage it sustained.</p><p>"If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…" he wrote. Brandon also shared a number of images to demonstrate the damage.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Jonzey8828/status/1864267929463988625" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>This Console Saved My Life Guys… <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxSeriesS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxSeriesS</a></p><p> I was on my way home from my local GameStop with the Xbox in my backpack when I was struck by a truck while riding my bicycle.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> - the cute and colourful dress up game with gacha elements - released earlier today, but was quickly hacked, with reports of players being met with a distressing and distasteful message.</p>
<p>Please note, there may be some upsetting content below. <strong>Please read on at your own discretion.</strong></p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1h73ssp/infinity_nikki_site_got_hacked/">reddit</a> and social media platform X, the Infinity Nikki website briefly displayed an abusive message earlier this morning, which was being used to promote fellow gacha game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> (there is no evidence this message was posted by a member of the Genshin Impact community). </p><p>A QR was also displayed under the message, but for obvious reasons, Eurogamer has not tested to see where it leads. However, it appears the hacked page was for the official celebration event, which asks players to use a QR code to open a page on their phone.</p>

<p>A reddit moderator suggested the Infinity Nikki website was "compromised for roughly 30-40 minutes", but advises players proceed with caution until developer Infold makes an announcement regarding the site's status.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it appears that the Infinity Nikki servers are down for some. Our Zoe was looking to stream the game this afternoon, however she has been met with a maintenance notice.</p>
<p>"The server is not open yet," the message on Zoe's screen reads, stating maintenance will conclude in 2029 (which we hope is an error). Additionally, Infinity Nikki's announcement page isn't working for Zoe.</p>
<p>It is unclear if these server issues are related to this morning's hack. Eurogamer has reached out to the Infinity Nikki team for comment.</p>
<p>We recently awarded Infinity Nikki four out of five stars, with our Jessica saying it has the potential to give Genshin Impact a run for its money.</p>
<p>"It sure is nice see miHoYo have some proper competition for once, and I know I'll still be returning to Miraland whenever I'm in need of a mood boost, whether that be in the form of humming along to catchy tunes while Whimcycling my way towards hot air balloons, or laughing at the melodrama in future story updates," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/openai-future-chatgpt-pc-gamer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last time I wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-california-conde-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad AI deals</a>, I wrote that I was “running out of things to yell,” but I guess I wasn’t: Future, publisher of games and tech sites such as PC Gamer, GamesRadar, Tom’s Guide, and Edge magazine, has made a deal with OpenAI.</p><p>According to an <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-future-partner-on-specialist-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI blog post</a>, “The initiative brings Future’s journalism to new audiences while also enhancing the ChatGPT experience. ChatGPT users will be able to access content from across Future’s portfolio, with attribution and links to the full original articles for transparency and further information.”</p><p>The post notes that this “partnership builds on Future’s existing deployment of OpenAI’s technology,” with chatbots currently on Tom’s Hardware and fashion site Who What Wear. I messed around with the Tom’s bot this morning, which does in fact cite the guides its information comes from. (For what it’s worth, asking the same question of ChatGPT itself did not return any sources.) This stands in some contrast to the experience<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/06/insider-union-chatgpt-hallucinating-links-business-insider-articles-openai-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Business Insider</a> had with its own OpenAI partnership, which failed to properly credit BI’s scoops.</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you that no good comes from feeding the work of writers into the ravenous maw of the plagiarism machine. This is yet another deal that serves OpenAI and the publishing companies it gets in bed with, while hurting the staffers and freelancers who actually <em>write</em> the words these companies need more and more of. While I can only hope <a href="https://aftermath.site/pc-gamer-games-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer’s headlines</a> confuse ChatGPT into some kind of meltdown, the more likely scenario is that we continue plodding along in this incredibly stupid and short-sighted way until the AI bubble bursts like so many tech bubbles before it. As AI’s capabilities <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/godot-isnt-making-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plateau</a>, even as OpenAI needs more and more <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-closes-66-billion-funding-haul-valuation-157-billion-with-investment-2024-10-02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money</a> and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/series/49/microsoft-three-mile-island-ai-nuclear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power</a>, it leaves time for more outlets desperate for cash to make these deals, which will either fizzle out (the best-case scenario) or ultimately let companies replace actual writers and actual stories with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slop</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, OpenAI is facing a lawsuit from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/29/canada-openai-lawsuit-cbc-postmedia-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian news publishers</a> in addition to the one it’s already facing from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments</a> this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seemed to walk back some of his grandest AI pronouncements, saying he “expect[s] the economic disruption to take a little longer than people think” and that “the world mostly goes on in mostly the same way.” This is a bit of an about face from his <a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declaration in September</a> that AI “may turn out to be the most consequential fact about all of history so far… AI is going to get better with scale, and that will lead to meaningful improvements to the lives of people around the world.”</p><p>While the <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dire</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">situation</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalism</a> these days is definitely due an improvement, this is badly not it. Here’s hoping Future’s writers see some of the money their work is earning their parent company, though somehow I doubt it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mr. Robot has been cheating death for a decade now, ever since Don’t Die, Mr. Robot first launched on PS Vita, but now it’s time for his greatest challenge yet: not dying in three whole dimensions. Kind of. 3D Don’t Die Mr. Robot spruces up the 2014 indie classic with new visuals, but even with the change of perspective, it’s the same core gameplay that makes it as addictive as ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="3D Don't Die, Mr. Robot!  *Wishlist Trailer 2*" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8mDp4fUDbw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mr Robot is stuck in the dimension of Neon Dunjun, tasked with collecting all sorts of fruit while avoiding enemies that pass across the stage in an attempt to destroy him. Mr Robot has no attacks of his own, but thankfully the fruit he’s collecting is actually explosive, blowing up and taking out any nearby enemies –&nbsp;he’s equally fortunate to personally be immune to these explosions, though just one touch from an enemy and it is lights out for him.</p>


<p>Different enemies have different movements that you need to work out. Some will fly in a straight line, while others come in a group and spread out across the level so you need to guide Mr Robot to stand in a gap between their paths, and yet more will home in on Mr. Robot, or pop in as a pair and fire a laser beam across the level. You need keep moving and adjusting your position, but will often find yourself getting cornered.</p>


<p>The main mode in 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is Remix, giving you a sequence of levels to work through. Every level has a ranking system from bronze to platinum trophies, and once you unlock the platinum trophy the level ends. Getting that platinum at the start of Remix is easy enough, because the game is still introducing you to the different elements of it. The further you get, the tougher things become. There are levels where the platform is tiny and enemies are popping up with no way to close the gap on them with Mr Robot, so you must instead wait for fruits to appear and line up to create a chain of explosions to save him. Linking these chains together rewards you with lots of points, though points don’t always mean prizes. In some missions, you have to destroy a set number of enemies while in others you have to collect coins. As you meet each trophy tier in missions the number of enemies increases, as does their speed, testing your reactions as you go.</p>
<p>Outside of Remix mode, there is Arcade mode which is essentially a score mode where you try to survive as long as you possibly can to rack up those points. And with online leaderboards, you will want to keep chasing those scores. My personal favourite named mode is Lime Attack, which is a time attack mode which is green and the only fruit that appears is limes. Chill Out mode brings some coolness to 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot too, and rounds out the modes available. &nbsp;Collecting the coins in missions is not a pointless endeavour if you love accessorising. You can use the coins to unlock all sorts of accessories for Mr Robot, including hats, glasses, shoes and body colours.</p>

<p>What Infinite State Games has nailed with 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is that feeling of chasing a high score, and doing better each time you go in. Every time I failed to hit Platinum in Remix mode, I would immediately replay that level over and over until I did get it… or the mission proved too tough for me, and I lowered my target to the Gold trophy.</p>
<p>One niggle I did find with the game was Mr Robot kind of getting stuck on corners in missions where the layout had some sharp corners or turns, which led to some runs ending quickly.</p>

Unexpected Games' latest premium expansion, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will add new game elements to the base game based on Season 2 of the popular streaming series.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to learn more about <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-mandalorian-adventures-review-is-this-way" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures </em>you can check out our review </a>where we praised the thematic decks and new player experience</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> was designed by Unexpected Games' studio head Corey Konieczka, the same mind behind the original release. The expansion introduces four new characters, four locations, and a brand new mission book. The expansion is not a standalone experience and requires the base game.</p>

This season involves the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin attempting to reunite his companion Grogu with the nomadic Jedi Order, all while avoiding attacks and plots by the Imperial Moff Gideon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Season 2 of <em>The Mandalorian</em> included some of my favorite Star Wars™&nbsp;scenes in the last decade. It was a blast recreating these moments for the board game, and this expansion includes so much more. From Boba Fett and Ahsoka Tano to duels and dangerous cards, I can't wait for you to see all the new content.” said Konieczka.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to new characters and missions, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> introduces new enemy types, ongoing events, and a duel deck. These elements can be integrated into the base game, adding more replayability to the experience.</p>

In addition to this board game about helmeted bounty hunters there is the collectible card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em></a> and the skirmish miniatures game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/star-wars-shatterpoint-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will be available in Summer 2025. It will be sold at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

The expansion more than doubles the total number of patents that EA has opened up since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system">launching the pledge in 2021</a>, and includes generation and recognition tools for speech and audio.</p><p>“We believe that games should be accessible to everyone and our industry-leading teams are always looking for new ways to make this a reality,” Kerry Hopkins, SVP of Global Affairs at EA, said in a press release. “By making this technology available to others, we continue to work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for players around the world by removing unintended barriers to access.”</p><p>Some examples of open tech patents include systems that can improve speech recognition, generate expressive speech audio from text data, and generate speech that mimics a player’s voice based on minimal sample speech data. One system uses machine learning to make a player’s voice sound older, while another “infers a player’s emotion while playing a video game” and automatically adjusts the game’s background music to best suit their emotional state.</p><p>EA says these patents could be used to improve gaming experiences for players with speech disorders or who struggle with verbally expressing themselves, helping them to communicate in a way that better represents their age, emotion, language, and speaking style. Alongside this announcement, EA is also releasing a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/">Unreal Engine 5 plugin that enables in-engine use of IRIS</a> — EA’s photosensitivity analysis tech — to help game developers identify frames that could impact photosensitive players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals is just an Overwatch clone. That’s what former Blizzard President Mike Ybarra seemed to suggest in a post on social media on Wednesday (December 4).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1864450732054675950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Ybarra called the game “Overwatch Marvel Rivals” while making comparisons to a recently announced game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks similar to Horizon Zero Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>“Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow,” Ybarra said. “Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of HZD) out of China. I mean even the character name – Widowmaker in OW vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol. NetEase/TenCent – all the same.”</p>







<p>Of course, one part of his comment that stood out was comparing Overwatch’s Widowmaker to Marvel’s Black Widow. It’s unclear to tell through text whether that was a legitimate criticism, but users on Twitter were quick to use the community note feature on the post.</p>



<p>Black Widow, for those that don’t know, first debuted in 1964. That puts the character 52 years older than Widowmaker. Again, however, it’s hard to tell if that comparison was serious or made in jest. That said, he has made other posts in relation to the game without addressing the comparison.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It might not be arriving anytime soon, but Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has made clear that work is resuming on Haunted Chocolatier.

The main reason for that has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">the developer's commitment to Stardew Valley 1.6</a>. Even since launching the considerable patch, bug fixes and console porting have been a priority. But now, Haunted Chocolatier should get the spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">"My next task will be to tweak the existing bones [of Haunted Chocolatier] until I'm happy with them, add all the rest of the bones, and then flesh it all out with all the content that will need to be in the game," wrote Barone.

"I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," wrote the developer. "Why? It's what I'm comfortable with, it's what I enjoy, and it worked well for Stardew Valley." Barone adds that help technically might be needed down the road, but Haunted Chocolatier would basically be complete before that.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/" data-ref-id="1100-6526220">Returning to Haunted Chocolatier after Stardew Valley 1.6 has always been the plan</a> for Barone, acknowledging the situation throughout this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/" data-ref-id="1100-6497292">Haunted Chocolatier was originally unveiled</a> over three years ago.

Despite debuting as a free PS Plus game, the otherwise $30 live-service shooter missed the two-week honeymoon period multiplayer games tend to get on console, and never managed to recover. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/foamstars-free-to-play-square-enix-october-ps5-ps4-pc-1851632964#:~:text=On%20August%2027%2C%20Square%20Enix,be%20free%20later%20this%20year.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-free-to-play-square-enix-october-ps5-ps4-pc-1851632964#:~:text=On%20August%2027%2C%20Square%20Enix,be%20free%20later%20this%20year."><em>Foamstars</em> went free-to-play</a></span> in October, but that doesn’t seem to have moved the needle much. </p><p>It probably didn’t help that the game was a PS4 and PS5 exclusive and unavailable on Xbox and PC.

Sony had intended to team up with Nintendo on a disc-based, next-gen successor to the SNES. Then the Mario maker decided to stick with cartridges at the last minute, completely changing the console gaming timeline in the process. A new machine was born, one that gave us some of our favorite games ever made. That was thirty years ago, and now it’s clear that it changed video game history forever.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc70fb42d8aaa4a4cc6aabb08f523b66" data-recommend-id="image://cc70fb42d8aaa4a4cc6aabb08f523b66" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Crash appears in his first game.

Thankfully, his game was a fantastic platformer that mixed up the camera angle and pace to deliver bite-sized levels that were distinct, memorable, and fun to replay over and over again.

This single disc was bursting with arcade action, containing fully realized video game adaptations of all three (at the time, the only three) <em>Die Hard </em>movies, each one completely different from the others. The first is a third-person shooter that has you gunning down hordes of terrorists as you navigate Nakitomi Plaza, while the second is an on-rails, first-person shooter that sees you blast your way through Dulles Airport and beyond before a ludicrous final sequence takes you to the skies in a helicopter, from which you shoot terrorists off the wings of an in-flight 747 before bringing the whole evil airplane down. It’s surprising, stupendous, and so uniquely <em>video games</em>.</p><p>The one I remember the most, though, is <em>Die Hard With a Vengeance</em>, an absolutely crazed driving game in which you barrel down the streets and around the parks of New York City. Drawn into a terrorist’s twisted game, you must intercept cars that have been rigged with bombs and prevent them from exploding, which, of course, you do by crashing into them repeatedly, <em>Chase HQ</em>-style. You get an assortment of camera options here, one of which is a first-person, in-the-car view. Hit pedestrians in this perspective and your windshield might get momentarily splattered with blood, quickly washed away by your windshield wipers. It’s all very ‘90s edgy and extreme. <em>With a Vengeance</em>, while pretty simple and limited, is possessed of the kind of kinetic energy that would later make games like <em>Burnout 3 </em>so exhilarating, and <em>Die Hard Trilogy </em>as a whole crackles with a balls-to-the-wall enthusiasm that made it a defining release of the early PlayStation era.—Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-recommend-id="image://4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man with giant wheels for hands battles in Paris.

Blow up the Eiffel Tower! Send your opponents plummeting from precarious New York City rooftops!

Instead, I’ll relay a memory. During my senior year of college, some friends and I had a borrowed PlayStation in the apartment we were sharing, much to the detriment of our studies, and the discovery of that game’s world, the struggles of its characters, and the monumental achievement of its design became part of the fabric of that year for us.</p><p>I’d been playing games my whole life, but in so many ways, <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>was like nothing I’d ever played before–so grandiose, so thematically complex, so audacious and spectacular. I’ll never forget one of my roommates coming back from class one afternoon, tossing his backpack down on the ground and shouting, “Gold chocobo!” before recommitting himself to the grind for the precious bird. We knew the world of <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>still held secrets we hadn’t yet attained, and we wanted to explore it for all its mysteries before venturing to that fateful final confrontation with Sephiroth. In the decades since, so many games have given us worlds that are more vast, more graphically detailed, more packed with time-wasting “content,” but I don’t know that there’s ever been a world that was more memorable and astounding, or that has served as the setting for a more epic and unforgettable tale. – Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-recommend-id="image://3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-format="png" data-width="1266" data-height="712" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mega Man and Roll run away from sky pirates.

It ditched 2D levels for an expansive, Saturday-morning-cartoon-esque world full of sprawling underground dungeons hiding powerful gear and dark secrets. I still remember the first time I went down a hatch, creeped around a corner, and immediately got skewered by a dual-drill-armed Sharukurusu. It was my first taste of open-world exploration and massive sandbox battles. Everything in this game was firing on all cylinders and it’s a travesty we never got <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-recommend-id="image://9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-format="png" data-width="1109" data-height="623" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abe walks along industrial scaffolding.

I wasn’t even 10 years old when I first saw Abe get gunned down outside a totalitarian industrial complex for getting on the wrong side of management and messing up a puzzle. The 2D adventure game had immaculately grim vibes with just enough cheeky, gallows humor to keep it from feeling entirely overbearing. The sequel spin-off had more depth and polish, but it still didn’t come close to the visceral gut punch of the first game. The opening FMV remains seared into my memory, and the late-game mechanical twist is an all-time great one. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-recommend-id="image://7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-format="png" data-width="986" data-height="555" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Parappa raps.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Parappa the Rapper </em>is not only one of the best PlayStation games; it’s also one of the <em>most </em>PlayStation games. By that, I mean it’s emblematic of the spirit of the original PlayStation, a spirit of playful innovation and experimentation that sought to produce new kinds of home console games and to create new kinds of fun and memorable experiences. <em>Parappa </em>proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that tapping buttons on a controller in rhythm with a song could be great fun, and that concept would go on to power some of the biggest games of the decade to come. And yet, it all could have failed if <em>Parappa </em>itself hadn’t been so great–so creatively distinctive, so vibrant, so packed with unforgettable songs. Thankfully, however, within a few minutes of starting the game, an anthropomorphic onion is teaching you to rap and do martial arts with the words, “Kick, punch, it’s all in the mind!” and it’s all so wild and surreal and committed to its own vision that you know, immediately, you are never gonna forget it. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-recommend-id="image://6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-format="png" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dracula and other characters from Symphony of the Night appear in official art work.

When <em>Symphony of the Night </em>arrived on the scene in 1997, however, it made a very strong impression, in some ways redefining our collective notions of what was possible in the genre of 2D action games. Going in without pre-defined expectations, many players of the time–myself included–found ourselves absolutely astounded by the game’s richness and depth. Just when we thought the castle couldn’t possibly have more to give, we’d find our exploration rewarded yet again with still more areas, secrets, and bosses. For my money, the game’s second half may represent the single biggest surprise in all of gaming, a secret the likes of which may never be topped. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-recommend-id="image://1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1065" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lara Croft shoots a Gatling gun.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The follow-up to Lara Croft’s inaugural adventure is, in some ways, a diabolical and infuriating game–I think part of me will be forever trapped in its notorious Venetian opera house level. The incredible intricacy of its environments, however, is also part of what makes it so memorable. <em>Tomb Raider 2 </em>proved that Lara Croft was no mere one-hit wonder, no fleeting sensation rocketed to short-lived stardom merely because of her sex appeal. With the success of this game, her status as an icon was cemented, and at the time, no other figure represented the new, PlayStation-powered era that video games were entering quite like she did. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-recommend-id="image://da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-format="png" data-width="1064" data-height="599" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites appear on a bridge in battle.

The sprite art was excellent, the class upgrades looked really cool, and the music was exceptional. I can still see the glowing blue oceans and molten lava battlefield squares pulsating in my sleep. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e8ca7195a05835e8e8caf5d7b7106023" data-recommend-id="image://e8ca7195a05835e8e8caf5d7b7106023" data-format="png" data-width="1430" data-height="805" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A brother and sister ride chocobos.

Not only did the hero not live to tell the tale, the true history of what happened was ultimately buried with him. While <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>examined corporate exploitation and militarism, <em>Tactics</em> interrogated political power and religious dogma. Even optimizing the job system to create a teleporting, dual-wielding ninja of death wasn’t enough to come out the other side alive. History only remembers the victors. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="634edc186a00f239b50c318635216d1c" data-recommend-id="image://634edc186a00f239b50c318635216d1c" data-format="png" data-width="1199" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A skeleton trips out while playing PS1.

A Tim Burton-esque marriage of horror and whimsy, <em>MediEvil </em>is bursting with grody imagery, and though it’s all cartoonish and goofy, that didn’t stop me from fixating on the scary shit when I played it in Kindergarten. <em>MediEvil</em> is clunky to play by modern standards, but its charm and humor are pretty timeless. Maybe that’s why Sony keeps remaking it. The PS4 version is a solid way to play it. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ed090741e86e9f40203e55ce5e24362" data-recommend-id="image://7ed090741e86e9f40203e55ce5e24362" data-format="jpg" data-width="947" data-height="532" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Snake hides from a guard.

Not only did the developer usher <em>Final Fantasy </em>into a bold new era, but it did so while also producing numerous other incredible works that pushed the role-playing genre forward. <em>Parasite Eve </em>is remarkable for many reasons, not the least of which is its fantastic use of a real-world setting, a real rarity for an RPG at the time of its release. Taking place in New York City in the final days of 1997, the game whisks you from elegant operas to hushed museums to grimy city streets while you–as NYPD officer Aya Brea–work to thwart a horrifying threat to the Big Apple’s population. To this day, Christmastime in New York City still makes me think of <em>Parasite Eve</em>, a game that manages to feel wintry, melancholy, thrilling, and unsettling all at once. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d5953be9d060a929a912684df9b6d30" data-recommend-id="image://3d5953be9d060a929a912684df9b6d30" data-format="png" data-width="1109" data-height="624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman is cornered by two zombies.

Still, I think plenty of PlayStation owners were keenly aware, by 1999, that the system didn’t really have anything that could compete with <em>Mario Kart</em>. That all changed with the arrival of <em>Crash Team Racing</em>, a kart racer so good, some justifiably felt it beat Nintendo’s series<em> </em>at its own game. <em>CTR</em>’s visuals were vibrant and appealing, the racing was thrilling, the tracks were brilliantly designed and had terrific shortcuts–it had all the pick-up-and-play fun of a kart racer along with the high skill ceiling genre enthusiasts crave. To top it all off, its Adventure Mode, which has you racing against bosses, unlocking new stages and making story progress, was the most elaborate and exciting single-player mode ever offered in a kart racer at the time. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-recommend-id="image://18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-format="png" data-width="892" data-height="501" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rinoa, Squall, and Seifer stand in a field of flowers.

And I don’t think any conversation about the impact of the original PlayStation is complete without it.</p><p><em>FFVIII</em> arguably endures in the hearts of its fans for many reasons: It’s a moving coming-of-age story set in a strange, hard-to-comprehend world. Its off-beat RPG mechanics are capable of being entertainingly exploited and utterly broken. The game features a rich, hybrid sci-fi/fantasy world with numerous cities and settlements to explore as you piece together its strange, time-bending narratives about moody teenagers shouldered with the burdens of protecting the world and each other. It didn’t land with everyone. But those of us for whom it did are still thinking about it nearly 30 years later.</p><p>I would argue that <em>FFVIII</em>’s dark horse status, however, is part of its character. While other <em>FF</em> games receive endless celebration and expensive remakes, the joy of <em>FFVIII</em>’s greatness is a sort of “if you know, you know” status for fans. In the last 30 years, I’d argue that the PlayStation brand has been home to many such experiences (fans of lesser-celebrated PlayStation titles like <em>Heavenly Sword</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, and <em>SOCOM</em> know what I’m talking about). <em>FFVIII</em>, to me, is one of the best early examples of that: Owning a PlayStation meant you could enjoy landmark titles while also finding some genuine hidden gems in its vast library. — Claire Jackson </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-recommend-id="image://7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-format="png" data-width="1028" data-height="577" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A car races down a track.

But I still stand by the belief that <em>Gran Turismo</em>, the first entry in Sony’s long-running racing sim series, looks good. It might not look realistic, but <em>GT’</em>s polygonal cars and wobbly roads still get the job done and remind me of a time when racing games weren’t live-service monsters. Plus, <em>Gran Turismo</em>’s chill jazz vibes make it easy to just relax and sink a few hours into racing around its various tracks in cool cars.

I spent what was probably hours playing around with the monster fusion mechanic that let me mix the creatures I captured into something that took on their physical traits, which was mind-blowing to me back in the 90s. But even setting that aside, I was enthralled at a young age by its melodrama. Walking through the village I’d been running around all game after its citizens had been turned to stone was terrifying and has been etched in my brain for decades.

The first was more evocative of <em>Digimon</em>’s digital pet roots, weaving raising a ‘mon from its baby form into a powerful monster capable of taking on some of the bigger threats you have to face. But it could also be frustratingly tedious, as your partner would go through multiple cycles of life, dying and being reborn as a baby you had to once again raise to the point of usefulness before moving forward.

If you ask me, the lineage of great 3D Spider-games that’s still going today all started right here with this incredible achievement. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-recommend-id="image://c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-format="png" data-width="845" data-height="475" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tony Hawk appears beside his avatar.

But <em>THPS2</em> is the better game, boasting the same snappy and responsive 3D skateboarding as its predecessor, but with new features and tricks. <em>THPS2</em> added manuals, letting you combo more tricks together to reach higher scores. It also included create-a-skater and create-a-park, letting younger me spend way too many hours tinkering with the game. Really, the only reason I stopped playing <em>THPS2</em> was to play <em>THPS3</em> on PS2. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-recommend-id="image://4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="621" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashely faces down a wyvern.

If I’d wanted that I would have played <em>Resident Evil</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and I very much did not. But I stuck with it and quickly realized I’d actually discovered one of the best games—still to this day—ever made. The writing is brilliant, the atmospheric dungeon crawling is clever and elegant, and the hybrid turn-based action combat is surprising and satisfying. It only had one problem, and that was the awful damage formulas that rendered all attacks useless unless you spent a ton of time grinding against particular enemy types or mastering its baroque blacksmithing system. But I persevered through the single-digit strikes against enemies and one-hit spells from bosses because the medieval noir thriller at <em>Vagrant Story</em>’s core is second to none.—Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

cars armed with chainsaw arms, and other forms of weirdness plaguing Nova City. You'll be able to get around the metropolis in a variety of vehicles, and judging by the trailer, it looks like the characters can also swing into action or sneak around enemies in a manner that looks heavily inspired by Insomniac's recent Spider-Man games.</p><p>When it comes to combat, Naked Science added that you can use your surroundings to defeat enemies, and between patrols, you'll also be able to take a break with various activities ranging from pub crawls to pumping some iron in a local gym. Ananta is in development for PC, PS5, and iOS, but it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is pulling the metaphorical season plug on its soapy shooter Foamstars next month, less than a year after its release.</p>
<p>In a blog post, the company announced its next season - known somewhat ironically as Party Goes On - will be its last, though it will remain online and isn't shutting down completely.</p>
<p>Foamstars' Party Goes On season will kick off on 13th December, and run until 17th January. After that, season updates for Foamstars will come to an end, and no new content will be added to the game.</p>

<p>"In this concluding update, expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customise shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future," Square Enix wrote.</p><p>Foamstars' previous season passes will be made available once again, for those players who may have missed them previously. Square Enix noted there will be the option for players to switch between passes and choose the season pass track of their choice. "This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season," it explained.</p>
<p>Those who want to go for the Premium Pass will need to pay, as before. The basic pass is free.</p>

<p>In a letter from producer <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/foamstars-letter-producer-5-dec-2024">Kosuke Okatani</a>, the developer thanked those who have played and will continue to play Foamstars.</p>
<p>"I don't want this to sound like a final message since you will be able to continue playing the game. However I wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to you all once again, so I've taken up my pen to write this producer's letter," Okatani wrote.</p>
<p>"Since the game's release on February 6, 2024, the development team has been working tirelessly to add new content and features, striving to bring the game as close as possible to that goal.</p>
<p>"Throughout both the development and operational phases, we have faced many challenges. However, the support of all of you who play the game, along with the incredible fan art, has been a constant source of encouragement for the team. It's because of this support that we've been able to overcome these difficulties, always with the goal of responding to your feedback.</p>
<p>"If Foamstars has become a game that you can enjoy with others, then we couldn't be happier."</p>

<p>Foamstars initially started life as a paid for release, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-a-like-foamstars-is-going-free-to-play-in-october-eight-months-after-release">becoming free-to-play a few short months ago</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin called Foamstars a "serviceable paintballer... lathered with some wild lore and underwhelming hero shooter elements" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-review">review</a>, asking: "What does it say about this shooter if the... character details are more entertaining than the 10-minute shooting galleries that precede them?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA Game Ready version 566.36 driver is now available for download, introducing support for this month's biggest games, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>Besides featuring optimizations for the highly anticipated game developed by MachineGames, which launches in a few hours for owners of either the Premium Edition or the Collector's Edition, the new Game Ready driver brings support for Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-path-of-exile-2-to-the-list-premium-monthly-subscription-is-50-off-until-december-30/">Path of Exile 2</a>, as well as support for the next Forza Motorsport update, which introduces ray-traced global illumination, and for the next Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 update which brings NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS 3, both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Marvel Rivals will release with support for NVIDIA's tech which boosts performance considerably at all resolutions and on all RTX 4000 series GPU. In MachineGames' title, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 3 can double performance on an RTX 4090 at 4K resolution, Supreme preset, and ray tracing. In Marvel Rivals, using NVIDIA DLSS 3 can boost performance by 2.8 times on average at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080.</p>
