The company quietly listed the $60 gamepad <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-HORIPAD-Steam-Midnight-Black-Deck/dp/B0DLLKRFG8/?tag=theverge02-20">for preorder on Amazon</a>, with availability starting December 16th.</p></div><p>Hori originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186645/valve-steam-controller-officially-licensed-wireless-horipad-announcement-specs">released its Wireless Horipad for Steam in October</a> — but only in Japan. The controller features dedicated buttons you can use to pull up menus in Steam, whether you’re playing in Big Picture Mode, or on the company’s handheld. Just like on the Steam Deck, the gamepad comes with touch sensors on its joysticks for motion controls and mappable back buttons.</p><p>The controller can connect to your computer or Steam Deck with Bluetooth or the included USB-A Bluetooth receiver. Hori says the wireless gamepad will last up to 12 hours on a full charge, but you can plug in its USB cable in case it runs out of juice in the middle of your game. Additionally, you can remap buttons and adjust the gamepad’s stick sensitivity, gyro controls, and turbo settings from the controller menu in Steam.</p><p>Hori’s controller lacks a few features you might expect to see on a Steam-specific controller, though, including rumble packs, a headset jack, and a trackpad. Still, it seems like a decent choice if you want a controller that’s sort of like an extension of your Steam Deck. It’s just too bad Valve hasn’t revived the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">ultra-customizable Steam controller</a> it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">discontinued in 2019</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

People complained about bugs, broken servers, and other serious issues across console and PC. Things have improved a bit since then, but the game is still in a rough place. As an apology for all this, players are being given a single free car. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,195189,196358" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em>, which had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,to%20seven%20days.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,to%20seven%20days.">three different release dates</a></span> depending on how much money you spent on it, arrived in September to negative reviews from critics and players. For some who forked over nearly $100, for the fanciest version that provided the earliest access, the game was basically unplayable due to server issues for days. Other players shared videos of physics and graphical bugs. In other words, <em>Solar Crown’</em>s launch was a big mess, and now, for those early players, the developers are offering a free (digital) Porsche as an apology, alongside a large update. </p><p>On November 4, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test Drive</em> publisher Nacon and developer KT Racing posted an update to Steam</a></span> thanking players for their “patience and support.” And to help win people back, those who logged into <em>Solar Crown </em>before October 12 will automatically receive the “Adventurer” edition of the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe after Season 2 launches. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nacon and KT Racing announced that on Tuesday the second major patch for <em>TDU Solar Crown </em>will be available on all platforms. This patch is focused on improving stability and performance on Xbox, PS5, and PC. The patch also promises to fix many of the server login issues players have been encountering since September. </p><p>“Over the past few weeks, we’ve worked hard to roll out multiple maintenance phases and hotfixes aimed at enhancing the game,” explained Nacon. “We know there’s still work to be done, and we hear you. Please know that your feedback is invaluable, and our development team is fully dedicated to addressing the issues you’re encountering as quickly as possible, while also refining features to ensure a smoother, more enjoyable gaming experience for everyone.”<br></p><p>Will a free car and the promise of more fixes be enough to win players over? I’m not sure. So far, the game’s Steam review rating is still standing at Mostly Negative. So there’s still a lot of work to be done if Nacon and KT Racing want to turn this car around.</p><hr><p>Here are the full patch notes for <em>Test Drive Unlimted Solar Crown’</em>s new major update:</p><h2 id="h148597"><a id=""></a>Servers/Network</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed various login issues</li></ul><h2 id="h148598"><a id=""></a>Performance/Stability</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reduced shadow cost in performance<br></li><li>Added various optimizations to improve memory consumption and overall stability<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen when entering a spot<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen when traffic spawned<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen while buying car parts<br></li><li>PC: Fixed a crash that could occur when playing with certain AMD GPUs<br></li><li>PS5: Reduced frame drops in performance mode<br></li></ul><h2 id="h148599"><a id=""></a>Graphics</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Improved global illumination performance<br></li><li>Improved octree tracing performance<br></li><li>Improved shadow quality created by headlights<br></li><li>Improved SSR upscaling<br></li><li>PC: Use DLAA instead of FSR TAA by default when available<br></li><li>PS5: Improved quality mode resolution from 1080p to 1440p<br></li></ul><h2 id="h148600"><a id=""></a>Compatibility</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>PC: Fixed binding and default preset on Thrustmaster TMX wheel<br></li><li>PC: Fixed Logitech G923 default binding<br></li><li>PC: Fixed Moza devices default preset<br></li><li>PC: Fixed issue where FFB was lost when the mouse was moved<br></li><li>PC: Fixed issue where FFB could still be present when navigating menus<br></li><li>PS5 &amp;

<p>Halloween is over, and Christmas is just around the corner. With Black Friday giving gamers quite a few options of titles to buy for the Holiday season, which games are the best to play for Christmas fans?</p>



<p>Here are the best Christmas video games to play.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-christmas-games-to-play">Best Christmas Games to Play</h2>



<p>Looking for the best Christmas games to play? Luckily, there are quite a few. However, many of these games are not necessarily Christmas-themed from the get-go. Many popular titles have Holiday updates during the season, giving gamers a break from the usual worlds they love to explore. </p>



<p>So, which video games are the best for players to jump into during Christmas?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been a leader in Christmas updates. The game adds quite a few new changes to its maps that go alongside the Holiday season. A personal favorite is the Christmas lights that can be seen hung up throughout different maps.</p>



<p>The game has many other additions, though, including new game modes and more. Last year during the Modern Warfare III Christmas update, we saw a mode called “Snowfight” introduced, which allowed players to kill each other using snowballs.</p>



<p>Sounds like a blast, right? With Christmas-themed rewards and more, the Call of Duty Christmas update is a must for gamers to play and will be introduced once again this December.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite">Fortnite</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite is another game that always has an update to go along with whatever big Holiday is around the corner. With Fortnitemares, the game’s Halloween update, just ending, gamers are preparing for a unique Christmas update. </p>



<p>The game even has a “12-days-of-Christmas” event, where players can head to a log cabin where a plethora of presents will be sitting around an open fire. Every day you open up the game during the event, you will be able to open up one present. These gifts range from skins to gliders to weapon wraps and more. </p>



<p>The game usually adds quite a few Christmas-themed features onto the map, too. Snow will cover a large portion of the island, giving players the proper Christmas feel.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go">Pokemon GO</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Expect to see Pokemon GO on this list? While many have thought to believe this game is dead, the popular mobile game by Niantic is still thriving and even has a Christmas update. </p>



<p>So, what’s all included in the Holiday update? Well, last year, during the Pokemon GO Christmas event, there plenty of players playing the video game were able to capture new Pokemon that had yet to be introduced to the game. There are still a few hundred names that have yet to join the game, so we could easily see more added during Christmas this year.</p>



<p>But new Pokemon is not the only feature that comes with the game’s Christmas update. Many new variations of Pokemon will begin to appear, all wearing Christmas or Holiday-themed clothing. For instance, in the past, Pikachu wearing a Santa hat could be seen and catchable throughout the streets.</p>



<p>The game also features special raids, rewards and more during the Christmas season, so get prepared.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Want a break from shooters or walking around your city in the cold trying to catch Pokemon? Well, the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft, has a yearly Christmas event called “The Feast of Winter Veil.”</p>



<p>This event has been happening for years now and is a staple within the Warcraft community. It will even translate over to Hearthstone and other WoW-themed titles.</p>



<p>Players who jump in during the season will get various rewards from gifts under the tree. There will even be reindeer seen that players can attempt to free. </p>



<p>Not only that but there will be plenty of rewards and items to collect, including Christmas-themed cosmetics and more. And yes, you can even pick up snow and throw it as snowballs. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft is by far one of the best Christmas games to play, if you want to pay for the monthly subscription, that is.</p>

<p>Nintendo modified its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025 after Switch hardware and software sales dropped significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, Nintendo’s net sales decreased by 34.3% for the first half of the fiscal year. Operating profit dropped by 56.6%, ordinary profit decreased by 61%, and profit attributable to parent company owners decreased by 59.9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s dedicated video game platform sales dropped by 34.1 per cent year over year, and “a decline in unit sales for both Nintendo Switch hardware and software” was attributed as the cause for this fall. Mobile and IP-related businesses also saw sales decrease by 43% year over year, as income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie decreased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s gross profit declined 32.6% year-on-year. However, the gross profit margin increased by “1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 60.8%.” Additionally, SG&amp;A expenses increased by 2.2% year-on-year, and the ratio of SG&amp;A expenses to sales increased by 13.4 percentage points to 37.5% year-on-year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the fall, Nintendo has decided to revise its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025. The new estimates are 1,280.0 billion yen in net sales and 360.0 billion yen in operating profit. The ordinary and net profit forecast will not change, staying at 420.0 billion yen and 300.0 billion yen, respectively. Hence, the forecasted annual dividend will remain at 129 yen per share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo has also modified the unit sales forecast for Nintendo Switch hardware and software. The forecasted unit sales for Switch hardware have been decreased by 1 million units and software by 5 million units, with the new numbers being 12.50 million and 160.00 million units, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 146 million units</a>. However, it suffered from a 31.0% drop year-on-year in hardware (4.72 million units) and a 27.6% drop year-on-year in software (70.28 million units). Also, Nintendo stated that the plan for Switch 2’s announcement before April 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unchanged</a>. What are your thoughts on Nintendo lowering its annual forecast?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has a ton of cards to collect from common collectibles to Ultra-Rare, Full art designs. Opening packs is one of the main ways to pull cards, and a long-standing rumor suggests certain boosters—”Bent Packs”—give you better luck.</p>



<p>It’s hard to quantify how much money I’ve spent on real-life Pokémon packs at this point. The buzz of opening a pack and not knowing what’s inside never gets old. Pokémon TCG Pocket digitizes the age-old hobby and converts the TCG into an easy-to-digest mobile phone format.</p>



<p>You still get to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open Pokémon packs</a> and experience the unbridled disappointment when you get a duplicate for the ninth time. A certain Bent Pack suggests you can boost your odds of getting super-rare cards from packs. Let’s see what all the fuss is about.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-do-the-corner-pack-trick-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to do the Corner Pack Trick in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Every trick in the book. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Corner Pack Trick—otherwise known as the Bent Pack—in Pokémon TCG Pocket, is looking through the carousel of packs, and when you come to make your choice, <strong>you turn the pack to its side</strong> and identify a certain shape of pack <strong>noticeably bent in one (if not both) of the corners.</strong></p>



<p>To be honest, I don’t where this theory started, I don’t know who came up with it, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless. I use my own superstitions when opening packs from spinning the packs around in a full circle to opening the pack from the right-hand side instead of the left side.</p>



<p>But if you look closely at the carousel and thoroughly investigate each pack, I can confirm you can see one of these bent packs from time to time. But does it actually mean anything?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-corner-pack-trick-work-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Does the Corner Pack Trick work in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>No science or logic proves the bent pack works in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong>, and after checking this out myself, I would conclusively say the <strong>corner pack is nothing but a myth</strong>—albeit a fun one to distract yourself!</p>



<p>Firstly, if you go onto the packs section of Pokémon TCG Pocket, the game has a button in the bottom-left corner saying “Offering Rates.” This is in line with <strong>regulations concerning loot boxes and gambling</strong> to protect you, and let you know the odds of getting each card, the rarity of a pack, and what you can pull—especially if you’re spending real money.</p>



<p>A bent pack might sound cool on paper, but it would be deceitful; players in the know would automatically gain an advantage over other players, and it would be a legal issue. Furthermore, I’ve tried these corner-trick packs, and there’s no obvious difference between them and opening a regular pack.</p>



<p>You can check out YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@spragelsPocket" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spragels Pocket</a> if you need a visual clue for the bent pack.</p>

<p>If you need a fresh way of opening packs, knock yourself out and hoard all the bent packs you can get your hands on.</p>

This year's N7 Day - the annual celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> held on 7th November - will be a "quieter" one than usual, developer BioWare has said. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on X, BioWare has told fans that N7 Day 2024 will still host "a little fun", but its attention was currently still focused on last week's big launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

<p>
Past years have seen BioWare release a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">trailer</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-teaser-image-revealed-and-analysed">concept art</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">audio snippets</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">logos</a> for the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> - now the studio's next project.

Details of Mass Effect 5 remain thin on the ground, though we know it will see a return to the series' home turf of the Milky Way galaxy, and pick up the action several hundred years after the conclusion of the original trilogy.

Unfortunately, there was a bug that made their custom appearance revert back to one of the default settings found in the character creator when starting the game. Folks, it was a massive bummer to get to some of those big story moments and not see my old hero as he should look. But hopefully this patch will rectify that issue so no one else has to deal with that when they reach the ending. The short list of some of the patch notes includes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>- Fixed an issue where some customizations were not applied to the Inquisitor correctly in one scene.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>- Fixed an issue where DLSS options could end up “grayed-out” on a 40-series Nvidia GPU.

By the time I got to the ending and saw some stranger posing as my Inquisitor, I was taken aback by such a cataclysmic bug rearing its head after nearly 60 hours. So I’m happy to see the team get this fix out so quickly.

Isn’t it just for kids? Aren’t you supposed to be playing <em>PUGB</em> instead? No! Because as nauseating as the infinite merch and all-pervading presence of the game may seem, it’s actually a <em>really </em>fun multiplayer shooter. And given it’s free, it’s still worth a look. But ho boy, seven years of development has piled up into one ridiculous mess of a lobby screen, making even just finding the core game a bemusing exercise. So, let us guide you through the madness.</p><p>Starting <em>Fornite</em> is, in itself, deeply confusing. Once you’ve created an account, you’ll be faced with a ludicrous wall of game modes before realizing there are multiple tabs to look through, piles upon piles of quest types, ongoing storylines, and a Battle Pas–and that’s all before you’ve figured out how to just start a game of vanilla <em>Fortnite</em>. On top of that, if you want to unlock a skin, you’ll either need to complete a quest or purchase them. That’s not even mentioning the game’s weapon color system. But don’t worry because this guide will break down everything you need to know about playing <em>Fortnite</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-recommend-id="image://96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-recommend-id="image://96f585dbc9478725a4cdfaed9cf23b29" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite game modes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When loading into <em>Fortnite</em>, you’ll automatically be in the “<strong>Play</strong>” section. This is where you can select various game modes to play. The majority of the modes are fan-made and can be played with friends. But if you want to play the vanilla <em>Fortnite</em> or other official Epic modes, you’ll need to scroll down until you see “<strong>By Epic</strong>.” From there, you should see all of the official Epic Game game modes that <em>Fortnite </em>is known for alongside the studio’s logo on the thumbnail.</p><p>Once you’re here, you’ll see modes such as “Ranked Reloaded, Ranked X Trials,” and much more. The Ranked modes are lobbies usually meant for people looking for more of a challenge. Most of these people are looking for other high-skill players to improve their rank on the <em>Fortnite</em> leaderboards.<br></p><p>If you’re looking for a more casual game, keep scrolling until you land on the Battle Royale mode, AKA vanilla <em>Fortnite</em>. This is the type of game that <em>Fortnite </em>is mainly known for. The rules for this mode are simple: The last one standing wins. From here, you can pick between two types of Battle Royale: Build and Zero Build.<br></p><p>If you’re looking for a faster Battle Royale, you can always play Reloaded. Like the normal mode, this can also be played in Build or Zero Build. However, it’s worth pointing out that this mode significantly differs from the normal BR mode. The map is much smaller and takes inspiration from OG <em>Fortnite</em>. When players die, they can respawn as long as the feature is enabled and their teammates are still alive. If this sounds a bit familiar to you, it’s because this is Epic’s version of <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> Rebirth Island mode. The games usually play a lot quicker and can be more intense. So, don’t jump in expecting a slow game.<br></p><p>To change lanes a bit, there’s <em>Lego Fortnite</em>, which is like an entirely different game. In a nutshell, this is Epic’s version of <em>Minecraft</em> and other survival games. There is a bit of a story to it, but the main goal is to build a base and survive for as long as possible. This is a third-person mode in which you’ll go toe-to-toe with various fantasy beasts and monsters.<br></p><p>In the vein of shaking things up, there’s also a mode called Rocket Racing. As the name suggests, this is a mode in which you and other players race against one another. The rules are fairly simple: be the first one to cross the finish line, and you’ll win. Think of this mode as Fortnite Mario Kart, if that helps.<br></p><p>The last big mode is Fortnite Festival. This mode allows you and other players to play licensed music from artists such as Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, and even Fortnite original songs. This is a rhythm-based mode in which you’ll be tasked with pressing the right buttons as they appear. There are two types of Festival modes you can play. The first is the Main Stage. This is where you all work together and jam out to get the highest score. The other is Battle Stage, where you’ll compete against one another to see who gets the highest score.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-recommend-id="image://f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-recommend-id="image://f63041ccf924925a393b27e888df554f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Build mode in Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Build and Zero Build play similarly, but each mode has a few significant differences. Players must destroy structures around the island in Build to get building supplies. They can farm and build from three different structures: wood, brick, and metal.</p><p>Wood structures build the fastest but have the least health. Brick takes a bit longer to build and has a decent amount of HP. Metal takes the longest to build but it has the most HP out of all three materials.<br></p><p>When playing Zero Build, you won’t have the option to do that. To combat this, players have an additional 50 overshield that automatically refills itself up. So, players can potentially have up to 150 shields throughout the match.<br></p><p>Other than that, both Build and Zero Build play the same.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-recommend-id="image://154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-recommend-id="image://154b70b4e0cde0ce8ec8e427f689d3b4" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite locker screen for equipping cosmetics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you play the game, you’ll unlock various items such as Back Bling, Gliders, and sometimes Skins. To equip these, you’ll need to be in the main menu once more and scroll over to the “<strong>Locker</strong>” section.</p><p>You can change various aspects of your character. So, if you unlocked a Back Bling and think it’ll be nice on Peely, you can mix and match it all you want. On top of that, you’ll be able to change up the Glider, which you use at the beginning of the game, to land. You can also change your contrail, which is the ora you see as you descend from the bus.<br></p><p>That’s not the only thing you can switch up. On top of unlocking cosmetic items, you can do the same with emotes. To do this, scroll down one tab in the Locker section, and you’ll be able to equip up to <strong>seven </strong>at a time.<br></p><p>If you want to change the skin of your gun, you can change it by looking at the “<strong>Wrap</strong>” section. Just like character skins, these vary from wrap to wrap. Some are more colorful and dynamic than others. These don’t give you any special edge, as they just personalize your current gun.<br></p><p>The last main thing you can personalize is how your car looks in-game. Like everything else mentioned in this section, they don’t give you any kind of edge. They just make you look cool.<br></p><p>Occasionally, Epic will allow players to unlock free car skins, but most of the time, they’ll have to purchase them with real-world money using V-Bucks. The car skins can range from cool-looking generic ones to real-world cars such as the BMW. You’ll also be able to change how the car rims look, smoke, and even boost.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-recommend-id="image://225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-recommend-id="image://225aab3be72e630e325a1d34ebc1b697" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fortnite quests screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s always good to go into a game to complete a quest. These quests vary based on which game mode you’re playing. So, make sure the quests are compatible with the standard BR mode if you’re jumping into a BR game. Most of the time, these quests will reward you with XP, and you’ll unlock more cosmetic items on special occasions.</p><p>It’s also worth pointing out that there are story-based quests players can complete. As the name suggests, these tell the story of what’s happening in the current BR season. These are worth doing because they trigger audio clips and reward you with many XP.<br></p><p>If you have a particular quest you want to complete before jumping into a game, you can track it. To do this, go to the specific quest you want to do and press “<strong>Track Quest.</strong>” When you load into a game, it’ll be highlighted for you and guide you through what you must do.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-recommend-id="image://01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-recommend-id="image://01ccd8bbecd8f5a528f484fe15f5b9e5" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An interaction between Iron Man and Doctor Doom during Fortnite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While playing <em>Fortnite</em>, you’ll notice that guns and items will have a specific color to them. This is extremely important because the color tells you much about the weapon at face value. For instance, whenever you’re rebooted back into a lobby, you’ll spawn in with a grey pistol, which isn’t the best because grey is the lowest-ranking color. </p><p>Below is a list of every weapon color, alongside its rank.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Grey - Common</li><li>Green - Uncommon</li><li>Blue - Rare</li><li>Purple - Epic</li><li>Orange - Legendary </li><li>Gold - Mythic</li><li>Cyan - Exotic</li></ul><p>One thing worth mentioning is that Epic often changes its mind about adding exotic weapons. Sometimes, they replace Mythic guns with Exotic ones, and other times, both are available in a single season. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A zoomed out Fortnite map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A zoomed out Fortnite map" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9c7b6e9e3457cf901bd60c48d766e7f3" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A zoomed out Fortnite map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The key to not dying immediately is to land where others are not. For example, if the bus is flying from Sandy Steppes to Castle Doom, you’ll want to avoid places like The Raft, Reckless Railways, and Restored Reels because they’re all within the immediate area.</p><p>Instead, you’ll want to land at places like Brawler’s Battleground or Rebel’s Roost. The further, the better. Because more often than not, most players won’t bother to land that far off from the bus route. Since you’ll be landing at a named land, the odds of finding good gear are incredibly high, and if you’re one of a handful of people there, you could loot up the entire area before anyone else.<br></p><p>If you do this, you should be able to at least survive the initial drop and get some good items along the way. It’ll also give you some time to experiment with guns so you can decide which ones you like.<br></p><p>We recommend always having at least one to two healing items at all times. Because you never want to be in a situation where you’re low on HP and die immediately in a fight.<br></p></div></div><div><p>Now that you have a solid load out, you’ll need to keep things going. There’s nothing worse than getting a bunch of kills just to die immediately. Finding a car is a good rule of thumb for long-term survival. These offer protection and allow you to travel across the map with ease. Plus, there are plenty of gas stations across the island. These let you refill your tank and recover from whatever damage it took.</p><p>You’ll also want to keep an ear out for other players fighting. The second you hear shots, get there as quickly as you can. More often than not, both players will be on the verge of death, and this is a fast way to earn an easy double kill or single kill. But be warned, you’re probably not the only person doing that. (This is also great if you’re in the final circle, too)<br></p><p>In <em>Fortnite</em>’s current season (Chapter 5 Season 4), vaults will open as the storm closes. These vaults will always have good loot, and on top of that, each one has a workbench that allows you to modify your gun. Those mods will make all the difference in a fight and can carry you to a victory royale. The catch is that the lobby will be notified when a vault opens up, so it’s a high-risk reward.<br></p><p>We also suggest you avoid Loot Island. It’ll always spawn mid to late-game. If you capture it, you’ll be rewarded with top-notch items. But the thing is, most of the lobby will be going there, and more often than not, the best players in the lobby would like to capture it. We don’t recommend going to the island unless you’re willing to risk it for the biscuit.<br></p><p>There you have it! Our ultimate guide on how to play Fortnite. Hopefully, this made things a bit more digestible for you to understand and made it easier to survive until the late stages of a Battle Royale match.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>N7 Day 2024, the annual celebration of the Mass Effect franchise, is just days away. And while fans are usually excited about any potential announcements from BioWare, the studio is warning people to keep their expectations low this year.</p>



<p>“We hope everyone is enjoying their time in Dragon Age: The Veilguard,” the studio wrote on <a href="https://x.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920">social media</a>. “It’s only a few days until N7 Day and this year will be quieter because of launch. Be sure to check back then for a little fun, though!”</p>







<p>N7 Day 2024 will be the 13th held by the studio. It began in 2012 and is named based on the N7 designation held by Commander Shepard.</p>



<p>As far as the future of Mass Effect, the next game in the franchise is currently in development at BioWare. The game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-5-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly being worked on</a> by “trilogy vets”. It’s unknown, however, where development sits and when a release date could come. If you need a Mass Effect fix in the mean time, a board game based on the franchise was recently released.</p>



<p>What do you think will be revealed, if anything, at N7 Day 2024? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

For just one energy, Moltres ex lets the player flip three coins and add a fire energy to a bench Pokémon for every heads, and its 140 hit points as a basic Pokémon allows it to stick around for a long time while charging up a Charmander, Charmeleon, and eventually Charizard on the bench.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that, by the time the opposing player forces Moltres ex out of the active Pokémon slot, there is often a Charizard ready to go with upwards of six energy attached, allowing it to essentially wipe out whatever is put across from it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo works in a similar way, though as a basic Pokémon itself, players will often put it directly into the active Pokémon slot. It also has a two energy, 50 damage attack and 150 hit points to keep it around and doing damage, meaning players have enough time to set up a Gardevoir on the bench.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Stage 2 Pokémon takes some time to set up, with Ralts and Kirlia coming before it, but once it's on the bench, players can use its Psy Shadow ability to add one energy to the active Pokémon. This again counters the discard two energy cost of Mewtwo's 150 damage attack, as the standard energy joins the Gardevoir energy each turn to add two at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's rare to see a deck that isn't one of these two in the more competitive battle mode, though one led by Pikachu ex and another led by Starmie ex appear to be just a tier below these two. Both present quick ex Pokémon with high damage, low cost attacks, meaning if players can deploy them quick enough it's hard for opponents to build a strong board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game. It lets players open packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collect cards</a>, build decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battle others</a>, a simple formula that has already proved popular given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">it made $12 million in just four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also hitting fast and hard with events, and players can perhaps test out these two heavy hitting decks in its latest. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">The Lapras ex Drop Event adds a new category in the Solo Battle menu</a> that lets players take on four increasingly difficult Lapras decks with a chance of winning a special booster pack after each, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">which can include the brand new Lapras ex</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-series-reaches-23-5-million-copies-sold-worldwide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the previous sales milestone for Persona in March 2024, the series has gone on to sell a whopping 23.5 million copies across the globe, with the sales including both physical and digital. In March, it was reported that the Persona series had sold 22.6 million copies. This was announced shortly after the release of Persona 3 Reload, which sold more than one million copies in less than a week. The Persona series is continuing to expand and become more popular, as it was once considered a niche series. However, as announced in <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/library/printing_annual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sega's Annual Integrated Report</a> for 2024, the report now includes the updated cumulative sales for the most notable IPs for Sega. This, of course, included Persona.</p>
<p>In this report, Sega says that the fast sales growth for both the Persona and Like a Dragon franchise can be attributed to the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-annual-franchise/">the games</a> were released on multiple platforms, as well as simultaneous worldwide releases. Not only that but remasters and spin-off titles have helped the franchises exponentially. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, as for most gamers, Persona 5 and the other Persona 5 spin-offs really helped bring the franchise to the forefront and introduced people to the series as a whole.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Persona 5 series alone sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Again, this is a statement that doesn't come as much of a surprise, especially considering how many games are in the Persona 5 series alone. In total, there are five titles in the Persona 5 series, with another game called Persona 5: The Phantom X due to be released in the near future. The Open Beta for this title began in April 2024, but there haven't been too many updates since then. Compared to the other games in the Persona 5 franchise, this one won't be as much of a mainstay as others, as only some of the original staff from the first Persona 5 game are working on this game, and it's marketed as a gacha game for the most part.</p>
<p>This year also saw the release of Persona 3 Reload, and then ATLUS branched out and created Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a game that has a similar art style to that of Persona and has also done significantly well. Whether we'll see remakes of the original Persona games that started off the franchise remains to be seen, as we've seen some of the older games get ported to other platforms, like Persona 4 Golden, which was released last year.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like this franchise is going to continue to be massively successful for Sega and Atlus.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-generation-zero-update-last</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-generation-zero-update-will-be-its-last.1028046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-generation-zero-update-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Systemic Reaction has announced that the next major&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>update will serve as the game's final major content drop.</p>

<p>The Showdown Update currently doesn't have a release date, but Systemic Reaction describes it as&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s "last hurrah", promising that it will conclude the story arc that's been running throughout the game's "main missions and in-game lore".</p>

<p>The update will take you to "a new area that you haven't been to before", and Systemic Reaction is promising that while it's not quite as big as some of the game's other areas, it will give the studio "the space needed to tell the last part of our story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/generation-zero-update-last-screens.jpg?itok=oz6nXfUl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/generation-zero-update-last-screens.jpg?itok=rqFjR_KA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This mysterious teaser image is pretty much all we know about the Showdown Update right now.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've not yet gathered all of&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s Soviet Nesting Dolls collectibles and you haven't caught up on "the attached lore" yet, Systemic Reaction recommends you do so prior to the Showdown Update's arrival.</p>

<p>As well as the story coming to a head, Systemic Reaction is also promising that the update will add new Experimental weapons, and it'll also remove the skill point cap, allowing you to "unlock all skill upgrades and complete the endgame experience".</p>

<p>New cosmetics are also on the way, as well as a host of quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes that are the bread and butter of any self-respecting game update.</p>

<p>Although you won't need&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s&nbsp;<em>FNIX Rising&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alpine Unrest&nbsp;</em>expansions to enjoy the Showdown Update, Systemic Reaction does recommend them for "more context".</p>

            <p>The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them. </p>

<p>The final 30 seconds of the trailer are an appalling display of sneakers kicking cars to death, flip-flops stamping on defenceless sandcastles, and stilettos flagrantly holding up traffic at zebra crossings. It's just as well the video is only a minute long, because the escalation curve is clear. If this were a four minute gameplay overview, the last third would consist of shoes vindictively toeing the Declaration Of Independence, or nudging lost kittens into jet engines.</p>
<p>Bambas! - yes, the exclamation mark is part of the title - is the work of Villena, Spain-based Devilish Games, who say it isn't just a game but "a tribute to urban culture". You can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274390/Bambas/">Steam</a>. Come release day in 2025, the game will "break stereotypes with its non-linear narrative and environmental storytelling, where stories unfold around every corner". You will "discover hidden spots that hold secrets and characters that will lead you down unexpected paths".</p><p>The game's setting is "a vibrant, detailed Mediterranean coastal city where creativity rules and exploration is your passport to fun", a place of Jet Set Radio-ish abandon where "you'll need to navigate crosswalks, kick cans, balance on curbs, and pull off impossible jumps to complete hundreds of challenges". It all looks and sounds very jolly - far from the Qwoppy puzzler I was half-expecting from the press release, and more in keeping with the mayhem of Untitled Goose Game.</p>
<p>Complete those challenges, and you'll unlock "countless" shoes. I've never been a shoe collector, myself - I've never had the budget for it, but also, I don't have the imagination. Any shoes I own are doomed to be worn everyday from dawn till dusk until they lose all form and colour and become muddy teatowels, wrapped around my feet.</p>
<p>It occurs to me, after watching the trailer for Bambas!, that my shoes might resent this treatment, and wish to be free of me. I am looking at my current trainers as I type this, and wondering what they'd do if I were... out of the picture. Readers, I am telling you this because I fear to utter the words aloud: <em>it is possible that my shoes are conspiring against me</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/binding-of-isaac-online-co-op-mode-10th-anniversary-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to the latest announcement by Binding of Isaac creator <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edmund McMillen</a>, the title will receive a full online co-op mode, including completion markers for its 10th-anniversary update. The online co-op mode is scheduled to arrive on November 18, 2024. The game will also receive a ‘considerable balance update’, which will look towards buffing items the community has found to be “lacklustre/bad”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binding of Isaac is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a massive 50% discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and discounts on all DLCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edmund McMillen and Nicalis, Inc. developed Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which was released in 2014. It is an action RPG shooter with a heavy focus on rogue-like elements. Players follow Isaac’s journey as he battles gangs of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, fears, and eventually his mother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features shooter gameplay in randomly generated environments. As Isaac, players will find mysterious treasures that provide the character with superhuman abilities and other skills to conquer more difficult enemies and explore unreachable areas. Rebirth is a remake of the original title with a new game engine, all-new hand-drawn pixel-style artwork, highly polished visual effects, an all-new soundtrack and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> From the Rift is the upcoming season of the battle-royale and it launches on Tuesday 5th November - yes, you read that right, it's out today! So, you really don't have long to wait to get your hands on the new and revamped Lifeline, Launch Royale, plus all the other goodies being added to round off 2024.</p>
<p>As recently announced on <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1853784986689622333">Apex Legends official X account</a>, this season will be home to Launch Royale - a brand new mode that lets you turn back time and set foot in the very beginning of Apex Legends, with the original Legends and weapons on offer to give you the original Apex experience.</p>
<p>That's just the first of many things to look forward to this season - up next is the remixed and revived Lifeline. The combat medic not only has a very literal new look with a robotic arm (with currently unknown origins), but all of her abilities are now different, too - redesigned to give better reset opportunities for any squad that contains her.</p>
<p>Lifeline's Passive still contains combat revive but it's been expanded, so now she can also grab onto D.O.C and glide mid-air for a short period of time until fuel runs out. You can let go of and grab D.O.C as much as you want during gliding, as long as there's fuel - which replenishes the moment you touch the ground. Weapons cannot be drawn while gliding, however.</p><p>D.O.C is still Lifeline's Tactical but the little drone now has more mobility. Instead of hovering in place, he'll now follow an ally he's assigned to while healing them and any allies in the surrounding area. Lifeline can call him back to her or reassign D.O.C to another teammate at any time.</p>
<p>Now, onto the biggest change, Lifeline's Ultimate says goodbye to the Care Package! In its place will now be D.O.C's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, a ring-shaped shield that's impervious to damage. Lifeline's squad can enter and exit the shield as they like, but there's no strafing if the ring is deployed inside a building or outside - it's the same wherever it's deployed. However, the halo is stationary and without a roof there's a vulnerability to attacks from above so watch your back.</p>

<p>Lifeline isn't the only Legend getting some love in Season 23. Gibraltar is getting a massive cooldown reduction on his dome from 30 seconds to just 17 seconds alongside two other upgrades. Newcastle's mobile shield will no longer take damage and it can now be controlled while downed, as well as Wattson being able to tap into the revive expert perk as a chooseable upgrade. At a recent press event, it was also teased that Loba and Mirage will see big changes this season but, at the time of writing, these are still to be revealed.</p><p>All Support class legends are seeing some boosts this season too, with class perks to help them excel in revival and recovery. Supports won't be slowed down while healing and small meds will heal double the normal amount. Also, this class will be able to revive allies 25 percent faster than before, with health regen granted to revived players and mobile spawn beacons in teammate's death boxes as well as at crafting beacons. To counter all that, Supports no longer have the unique ability to craft squad banners.</p>
<p>On the subject of Legends, the Apex Legends team has made clear it's aware of the issues with Crypto and his Off The Grid ability, but has assured there are changes coming to fix these issues at the start of the season and Off The Grid will be staying for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Now, let's move on to the new loot type being added in From the Rift - Rift Relics. These are new and exceptional pieces of loot - and something to look out for. When lightning strikes the ground from cosmic rifts in the skies above, you should follow the beam of light to find new high-level loot. These loot items are different from anything else found on the ground across the maps in terms of sheer power and functionality, and there's even some items that will be familiar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> fans. One such item is the EPG-1, marked as possibly the biggest and most powerful Rift Relic Weapon.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>There's a new category of item being added as part of this, called Boost Kits. These add passive or active abilities to your Legend when you find them. For example, The Hover Boost Kit will let you hover in the air while aiming.</p><p>We've learned there are more than 25 Rift Reflics available in the loot pool, which will be added gradually across the season. Getting your hands on any of these relics can dramatically turn the tables of who is winning in a match - so it's worth battling it out to find them before someone else does. These new and intriguing loot items will be available across PUBS, as well as the limited-time Trios Revival and Straightshot Revival modes this season.</p>

<p>Weapon update time, and first of all the HAVOC is going into the care package with the Select Fire Beamshot attached. As one goes in, another comes out so the Devotion is returning to the floor without the Turbo Charge but it has received multiple baseline buffs to compensate. The Sentinel and Rampage have had their charge capacity increased, the Longbow and Spitfire have had damage buffs, as well as the L-Star now dealing extra damage with the P2020 Akimbos getting a hip fire accuracy increase.</p>
<p>A new universal melee weapon has been added, the Karambit. Also called Raptor's Claw, its design and animations won't be the same for each Legend. Every character will have their personalities reflected by this weapon if they use it and it will be available at the launch of From the Rift.</p>

</figure>
<p>Ranked has had some tweaks that are said to be laying the foundations for bigger updates coming in the future. A new visualisation tool will be introduced in ranked lobbies so you can see the distribution of ranks in the one you're in. It's a bar at the bottom of the screen that shows you what rank players are in the lobby and how many of that rank are. There is a plan to add this mechanic to other modes in future seasons.</p><p>The entry cost for platinum, diamond and master ranks will be reduced and new ranked rewards are actively being worked on to replace the removed dive trail rewards, but it's worth knowing they're likely coming in the near future instead of this season.</p>
<p>Apex Legends' team told us that working on anti-cheat is its top priority. The developer is working hard behind the scenes to continuously improve anti-cheat and working with more anti-cheat tools to ensure that the matches remain fair in such a competitive game.</p>
<p>Apex Legends From the Rift will launch on Tuesday 5th November 2024 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>With Grand Theft Auto VI, Rockstar Games has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior while offering players more freedom than before, according to a former developer of the game.</p>
<p>Speaking With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GTAVI-oclock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTAVIoclock</a>, former game designer at Rockstar Games, commented on the next entry in the open-world series launching next year, saying that the developer has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior, which will blow everyone away and will be talked about many years after launch. The former developer also talked about mission design, saying that it will be what makes the game good, granting players freedom. As for the current state of the game, Grand Theft Auto VI is in the bug-fixing phase, so hopefully, it won't take much longer to see more of it.</p>

<p>It has been almost a year since we last saw Grand Theft Auto VI, thanks to its official announcement trailer, which provided a very quick look at the two protagonists and the state of Leonida, where Vice City is located. Since then, Rockstar Games has been pretty silent about the game, leaving plenty of room for rumors and speculation regarding its precise release date, which hasn't slipped to 2026 as of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">September</a>, leaving fans plenty of time to put together documents going over everything that is currently known about what will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time, according to analysts.</a></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It will be released sometime next year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-for-future-updates.1027995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-new-creative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that&nbsp;it has appointed a new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>creative director, and he'll be helming what will be the game's biggest update yet.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>website, Drew Rechner will be stepping up to the plate as the game's new creative director. Whether previous directors Julian Gerighty and Mathias Karlson will still be playing a role in the game's ongoing development remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In the blog post, Rechner says he's identified "three key areas" in which he and the team would like to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, namely combat, stealth, and character control.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=G116zB68 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=YZ6CPU3O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft still wants to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>across the board, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to combat, Rechner says the studio is looking to add "more depth and excitement to the experience" in order to further reward players' "tactics and precision".</p>

<p>When it comes to stealth, the plan is to improve the "readability and consistency of enemy detection" and to provide more "choice" in how you want to approach encounters.</p>

<p>Finally, character control improvements will apparently involve "improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls".</p>

<p>These are areas in which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-112">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>updates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-130-stealth-speeder">sought to make improvements</a> as well, particularly in the case of stealth, but Rechner says the forthcoming update 1.4 will be&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' "biggest yet" when it lands on November 21st.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft and set, believe it or not, in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>You play scoundrel Kay Vess, who must wheel and deal her way through the underworld's crime syndicates as she plans the heist of a lifetime. The game mixes shooter-style combat, stealth, and open-world exploration.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of its IP,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">underperformed for Ubisoft financially</a>, leading to the company rethinking some of its strategies; Ubisoft games will be released on Steam on day one from now on, and the company is also dropping the season pass model for future releases.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to Steam on November 21st, the same day the next update arrives.

October was when it announced the original Switch, before launching it the following spring. But with no further news on the next console, despite plenty of other Nintendo announcements, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-mario-screen-specs-features-1851653104&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-mario-screen-specs-features-1851653104">a look at the Switch 2</a></span> before the end of 2024 is looking less likely. </p><p> “Making an announcement this year has gotten quite difficult,” Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Reuters</em></a></span>. “You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season.”</p><p>Indeed, Nintendo is already losing ground on this year’s ambitious sales plan for the nearly eight-year-old Switch. The company previously aimed to sell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">13.5 million consoles in 2024</a></span>. It cut that projection by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 million in today’s earnings report</a></span>, which is still an ambitious goal given the lack of any major first-party blockbusters this holiday. Nintendo’s only sold 4.72 million Switch consoles year-to-date. </p><p>Despite a steady stream of smaller, mid-sized games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and ports like <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, the original Switch is clearly running out of gas. Outside of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, Nintendo seems to be holding the next round of upcoming heavy-hitters until the Switch 2 is out, and who knows when that will be.<br></p><p>At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if the company holds its big reveal showcase until the standard February Nintendo Direct. Diehard fans just need to hang on for a bit longer. A surprise release of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> in January might help with that.  After all, that’s when the first <em>Pokémon Legends</em> game hit. </p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You see, I take them far too seriously and, not to toot my own horn, I’m good. I routinely top the leaderboard for kills and objectives. So, after growing up reading and watching <em>Starship Troopers</em>, the basic concept of slaughtering bugs on xeno planets across the galaxy—specifically in a horde shooter setting—immediately caught my attention the day the Early Access began. Like thousands of players since its EA launch, <em>Starship Troopers: Extermination</em> kept me playing through countless updates until we finally hit 1.0 in October, 2024. With new players refilling the ranks, it’s time to reflect on the experience and see how it fares on Steam.</p><p>While I’m enamored with the game and its genre, not everyone feels the same way. As of writing, despite <em>overall</em> positive reviews, <em>Starship Troopers: Extermination</em> sits at ‘Mixed’ on Steam. Many players take issue with the game’s performance following full release. They say it feels like an Early Access title, full of bugs, glitches, and stuttering performance issues that ruin the experience. That’s not to mention the long queue times and crashes-to-desktop frequently plaguing the matchmaking experience.</p><p>All that said, look at many of the game’s positive reviews. While you’ll find the usual, “The only good bug is a dead bug,” type of reviews, mimicking lines from the film, most come from genuine fans—some of which have hundreds or thousands of hours of game time. They tout the class variety, PvE gameplay, co-op experience within the community, and the hordes of bugs you can slaughter atop the walls of a FOB. It’s an experience unlike most others.</p><p>Whether you’re on the fence, or seeking validation about your current favorite first-person shooter, here’s a look at <em>Starship Troopers: Extermination</em>, as told by Steam reviews.</p><figure id="" data-id="f6ace86d3e595c69b8d525224f141dcb" data-recommend-id="image://f6ace86d3e595c69b8d525224f141dcb" data-format="png"

<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out and it’s been a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17037/dragon-age-the-veilguard">well received game overall</a>. It’s launch 10 years after the last mainline Dragon Age game has had people wondering if the original games could get the remaster treatment. </p>



<p>While Creative Director John Epler would like it to happen, he doesn’t see it likely. In an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> around the game’s launch, Epler was asked about seeing the first three games remastered in some way. </p>



<p>“I think I’m one of about maybe 20 people left at BioWare who’s actually used Eclipse,” Epler told the outlet. “It’s something that’s not going to be as easy as Mass Effect, but we do love the original games. Never say never, I guess that’s what it comes down to.”</p>



<p>While he does say “never say never”, the technology of the original games could prove a sticking point. The first two Dragon Age games from 2009 and 2011 were built with the custom Eclipse engine. The third game, Dragon Age: Inquisition ultimately moved to the Frostbite Engine, making it more likely for a remaster than the others. </p>



<p>Rolling Stone mentioned the Mass Effect games getting remastered. Those games were built on Unreal Engine, making it an easier task to bring forward with newer technology.</p>



<p>If it were to happen, it would almost be a certainty that the first two games would have to be built from scratch in Frostbite, or a different engine.</p>



<p>Do you think the original Dragon Age games get remastered? Let us know below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>If you spend any amount of time online, specifically on X (formerly Twitter), then you know Elon Musk enjoys the sound of his own voice. More specifically, the look of his opinions in text format, as the man tweets constantly. It’s downright amazing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how he has time for anything else besides posting online</a>. Still, in his spare time, he’s quickly risen through the ranks to become a top 20 Diablo 4 player—one of only two in the United States. It’s absolutely shocking and entirely true.</p>



<p>It’s well known that Elon Musk plays video games. It wasn’t long ago that players online tore apart his Elden Ring build, after all, but he appears to favor RPGs with grind involved. In Diablo 4, he’s previously complained about how overpowered Barbarians are, and as a Barb main, please cry about it, Elon. Oh, but he plays a Barbarian primarily. Go figure!</p>



<p>During his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, Musk kickstarted the conversation by bragging about becoming one of the top 20 Diablo 4 players in the world. He’s one of only two Americans currently on the list, with the other topping the leaderboards in the number one spot. Currently, Musk sits in 19th.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, this ranking revolves around Pit runs. He’s achieved the 19th best timed run through Pit 150, which is an absolutely challenging grind and, honestly, a little impressive.</p>



<p>Instead of playing his usual Barbarian, Musk ranked with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-reveals-new-spiritborn-class/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Spiritborn class</a>, part of the Vessel of Hatred expansion. Furthermore, he’s running a Quill build.</p>



<p>Alongside Diablo 4 and Elden Ring, Musk is also a long-time fan of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>Do you think Musk managed to hit the leaderboards in Diablo 4 legitimately or not? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>On the topic of Elon Musk, did you know he’s considered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most successful streamers ever</a>? He broke records in a single hour!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starship-troopers-terminator-warhammer-40000-helldivers-2-creative-director-reveals-his-dream-crossovers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Smash hit co-op shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> seems ripe for a crossover, but which franchises might it partner with? That’s a fun conversation players have been having ever since the game’s explosive launch earlier this year. Now, Helldivers 2’s creative director has had his say, revealing a number of intellectual properties he’d love to work with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793032249765932" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Arrowhead CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt cautioned against doing too many crossovers, saying “it would dilute the IP and make it a ‘not Helldivers’ experience.” However, he also published an extended list of IPs he “really would love to do a take on!”</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Aliens</li><li>Starship Troopers</li><li>Terminator</li><li>Predator</li><li>Star Wars</li><li>Fifth Element</li><li>Blade Runner</li><li>Warhammer 40k</li><li>Trench Crusade</li><li>Mutant Chronicles</li><li>Dropzone Commander</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to see how many of these franchises would work within Helldivers 2. Starship Troopers is the obvious choice, given Helldivers 2 riffs so heavily on the cult classic sci-fi flick. Terminator, too, seems an easy fit, given the Automaton alien enemy are basically Terminators themselves. Aliens, Predator, and Star Wars are fun to think about, but my favorite is Warhammer 40,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It would be amazing to drop down into a planet overrun by Tyranids or Necrons as an Imperial Guard soldier, complete with lore-accurate weapons, vehicles, and, of course, dialogue. Yes, Warhammer 40,000 fans have the wonderful and hugely successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> to play right now, but that's a Space Marine game. Helldivers 2 is near enough an Imperial Guard game already. I’d drop a dollar or 10 on an Imperial Guard crossover in a heartbeat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which brings us on to the next question: how might Helldivers 2 do crossovers if it ever came to it? In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793858959634504" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subsequent tweet</a>, Pilestedt suggested it could come in the form of a Warbond (Helldivers 2’s take on a battle pass) or even individual super store items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having a full Starship Troopers Warbond with mobile infantry armor, voices and weapons would also be cool!” Pilestedt said, before stressing: “Nothing decided yet. Just musings :)”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Can Arrowhead do a deal for a crossover? Helldivers 2 has certainly done well enough to draw out some big hitters. Let’s not forget that Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, selling an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks. And while player numbers on Steam aren’t what they once were, they’re still extremely healthy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, crossover dreams remain just that. In the shorter term, Arrowhead continues to update Helldivers 2 with new Warbonds and patches, with the threat of a new alien faction looming over the galactic horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
