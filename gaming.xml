            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-bucharest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games has announced that it's opening a new studio in Bucharest, Romania, representing the studio's fifth development location and its first in Europe.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/bucharest-studio-announcement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on the official Amazon Games website, the Bucharest studio will "focus on supporting Amazon Games' diverse portfolio of games now and in the future".</p>

<p>According to Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann, Bucharest is "one of the top emerging European cities for game development", and the addition of a studio in the city is Amazon's "natural next step".</p>

<p>He's worked with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Crew</em>, and he says he's excited to join Amazon Games in order to get the chance to work on the company's "exciting roadmap".</p>

<p>As well as announcing Pana's stewardship of Amazon Games Bucharest, Amazon also <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/cristian-pana-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released an interview</a> with its new studio head in which he discusses his career, his achievements, and some of the projects he's overseen.</p>

<p>Pana says that the game of which he's most proud is&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, where he headed up the development of post-launch content.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tom-clancys-the-division-cristian-pana.jpg?itok=e5zY_GEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tom-clancys-the-division-cristian-pana.jpg?itok=gshcnZc7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cristian Pana has worked on Ubisoft games like&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Amazon Games Bucharest's creation and Pana's appointment come after the company's gaming division <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-games-division-hit-by-over-180-layoffs-amid-refocus-on-prime-gaming">laid off around 180 employees</a> back in November last year.</p>

<p>Those layoffs took place against the backdrop of a wider industry trend that has also seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-layoffs-targets-20-of-workforce-resulting-in-1100-jobs-lost">Hasbro</a> letting hundreds of employees go within the last year or so.</p>

<p>Despite that, Amazon still has a pretty stacked slate of upcoming games, with projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-protocol"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, an as-yet untitled&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game, and a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-game-studios-cancels-lord-of-rings-game">no, not that one</a>) currently in the works at the company's gaming division.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where Bucharest slots into Amazon's plans. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24160999/hellblade-2-headphones-audio-engineering<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23992977/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-looks-extremely-intense"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, the first and only instruction the game provides is that the game is <a href="https://youtu.be/nTek6v64bG4?si=bgQ9B4nEIf3SXEYH">best experienced with headphones</a>. Typically, I always ignore that advice. I’m not a “headphones on, lights off” kind of player. I don’t need <em>ambiance. </em>But for <em>Hellblade II</em>, I decided, “Why not?” What followed was an aural <em>experience</em> that thrilled, frightened, and unsettled the Hel(lblade) outta me.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Of course, if, for whatever reason, you can’t play with headphones, the game’s subtitles and closed captioning do good work conveying the game’s unique audio design.</em></p><p>In <em>Hellblade II</em>,<em> </em>the follow-up to 2017’s<em> Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, Senua, a Pict warrior, embarks on another harrowing journey. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">Instead of venturing to the gates of Helheim</a>, she travels north to confront the viking raiders that have been stealing and enslaving her people. On her journey, Senua is accompanied by a Homeric chorus of voices that reflect her struggle with psychosis. The team at Ninja Theory made it a point to explain that they <a href="https://youtu.be/KVBxvlRV0d4?si=-FsKyhWDLqitiAid">consulted with mental health experts</a> — including a professor of psychiatry at Cambridge University and people who live with the disorder — in order to portray psychosis respectfully and accurately. That manifests as hearing voices clip in and out of each side of my headphones. At the beginning of the game, I would whip my head left or right as the voices jumped around before I finally grew used to them. </p><p>There’s a richness to the voice performances that are lost if they’re diffused through open air instead of beamed directly into your ears. They speak in short, staccato sentences, contextualizing Senua’s feelings about a particular encounter. When she meets someone, her voices wonder if they can be trusted. In fights, they shout encouragements and admonitions. “Get up. Get up!” or “They’re so strong!” I like the voices. They remind me of my own rapid-fire internal monologue quipping about the myriad things that flit around in my head.</p><p>Senua’s voices also help with navigation and puzzle solving, but not so much that it becomes obnoxious. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there’s none of that “the dialogue tells you the solution” stuff <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23631177/chatty-video-game-characters-god-of-war-horizon-forbidden-west-high-on-life-forspoken">that happens in other games</a>. For the first puzzle section involving a path blocked by a large symbol, the voices yell “Focus!” prompting you to press the right trigger to engage Senua’s focus ability. When I got lost during a particularly bewildering section in a dark forest, the voices remarked only once that I was lost then shut up, leaving me to figure out the solution in blessed silence.</p><p>In delving into a drained lake, I could hear water dripping all around me as the caverns echoed with the sound of my breathing. The further I traveled, the darker it got, and the more sinister the sounds became. My breathing slowly transformed into the guttural sounds of disquieted spirits. That should have been a problem. I <em>hate</em> the sounds typically associated with horror — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/21/23416630/scorn-h-r-giger-xbox-game-pass-horror-game">that crawling, squelching sound</a> used whenever a game or movie wants to convey that something’s gross and wet. But the scary sounds in <em>Hellblade II</em> never crossed the threshold into repulsive or triggering for me (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/5/14497584/misophonia-eating-sound-brain-scan-fmri">misophonia sufferers</a>, rejoice). Instead, the sounds were soft and quiet but no less sinister, sounding as though they were just over my shoulder in the real world.</p><div><figcaption><em>When audio enhances visual, </em>Hellblade II<em> becomes a harrowing experience.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ninja Theory</cite></p></div><p>My aural journey with <em>Hellblade II </em>wasn’t limited to sound effects and voices. The music also played an integral role in crafting a visceral full-body experience with the game. Early on, there’s an encounter where it all combines — music, sound effects, and voices — to create a goose bump-inducing moment that I won’t spoil. The tempo of the music combined with the on-screen action created a beat that I could physically feel reverberating in my chest as I played. It’s a game-defining moment that really nails the skill and creativity of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s sound team. </p><p>I’m an aural person, someone who places great emphasis on sound, and <em>Hellblade II</em> felt like it was a game made for me. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there is no in-game UI. There are no tutorial pop-ups that pause the action to tell you what buttons do what or how to interact with the environment. A UI adds a layer of artificiality, reminding you that you that this is make-believe. Without it, the game created a level of reality that I’ve never really experienced before, forcing me to fully inhabit Senua as a character. And with headphones in, I heard so much more of the world and got a greater feeling for Senua’s unique experience in it. </p><p><small><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> is out now on Xbox and Game Pass. </small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nintendo has acquired known porting studio Shiver Entertainment from Embracer - the studio behind the recent Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 Switch ports.</p>
<p>The acquisition was <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> through an official press release earlier today. Following the acquisition, Nintendo will obtain 100% of the outstanding shares of Shiver to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese gaming behemoth. As mentioned above, Shiver has been working on the recent Switch versions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-switch-looks-performs-well-caveats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Software's Hogwarts Legacy</a> and NetherRealm's Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>"By welcoming Shiver’s experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles", the press release reads. "Going forward, even after it becomes a part of the Nintendo group, Shiver’s focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1792730561708204474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by Bloomberg journalist Takashi Mochizuki on X, many see the acquisition as a way for Nintendo to strengthen resources available for third-party devs to bring more high-end titles to the recently confirmed Nintendo Switch 2, which is expected to arrive sometime next year.</p>
<p>During Nintendo's most<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recent earnings call</a> with investors, President Shuntaro Furukawa talked about expansion, pointing out that acquisitions might be part of the company's strategy, although the focus is expanding via recruitment of recent graduates and mid-career hires. "Although development resources could be expanded through M&amp;A, first we will work within the company with our developers, who thoroughly understand and have built up the Nintendo brand over the years, to have them nurture talent who can drive Nintendo's future development", Furukawa said. "In addition, many of our external development partners have gained a deep understanding of Nintendo's way of thinking and game development methods over the many years of collaboration, and we would like to further strengthen our ties with such partners."</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-when-is-call-of-duty-coming-to-game-pass.877290/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vcZwIR">Last October, Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close">completed</a> its $68.7 billion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23546288/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-deal-merger-ftc-latest-news">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> and taken ownership of a raft of huge gaming properties, not least among them Activision’s Call of Duty series. Microsoft is now theoretically free to add all Activision Blizzard games to its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23759446/xbox-pc-game-pass-ultimate-subscribe-price-perks">Game Pass subscription service</a> on Xbox and PC. So it’s natural to wonder when Call of Duty games — 2024’s installment in particular — will hit Game Pass.</p>

<p id="DFj8Vu">According to the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft intends to release the next Call of Duty game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158941/call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-microsoft">directly on Game Pass on day one</a>. The game doesn’t have a title or release date yet, but on previous form can be expected in late October or early November 2024. Microsoft is expected to unveil the game and detail its release plans at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145559/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops">Xbox showcase on June 9</a>. However, Microsoft has so far made no official comment on when Call of Duty games might be coming to Game Pass. </p>
<p id="R6LfRz">Activision Blizzard, moving to get ahead of speculation before the completion of the deal with Microsoft, <a href="https://x.com/ATVI_AB/status/1711464921077006751">said on Oct. 9, 2023</a> that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> and its other big 2023 release, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-4/40629"><em>Diablo 4</em></a><em>, </em>wouldn’t be added to Game Pass that year, but said it did plan plan to begin adding games to Game Pass in 2024. Indeed, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074326/diablo-4-xbox-game-pass-release-date-blizzard"><em>Diablo 4</em> was added to Game Pass</a> back in March, but Call of Duty so far remains notable by its absence.</p>
<p id="vJUvOu">Speaking to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxuEV8xqEM&amp;t=673s">official Xbox podcast</a> on Oct. 17, 2023, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, “The regulatory process took so long [...] that we weren’t able to get in and work with Activision Blizzard on that back catalog work. Now that the deal is closed, we’re starting that work, but there is work.” Spencer continued: “The fact that we’re not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I’m very excited about the future.”</p>
<h2 id="fNEHx9"><strong>When will old Call of Duty games come to Game Pass?</strong></h2>
<p id="mKu7gi">This is unclear. Microsoft could have added older Call of Duty titles to Game Pass by now, and many expected it to, but it hasn’t. Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/11/22325601/bethesda-games-on-xbox-game-pass-xbox-one-series-x-pc">began adding Bethesda games to Game Pass</a> within weeks of that deal being completed in March 2021. The initial list ran to 20 games, focused on back catalog titles. But this hasn’t happened for Activision Blizzard games.</p>
<p id="cpdTBr">As for the most recent game in the series, <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, Activision has a marketing deal with Sony that will probably preclude that game’s arrival on Game Pass for anything from six months to a year. It also has a well established marketing and business plan for Call of Duty that works on an annual schedule, which Microsoft may not want to ride roughshod over. For those reasons, we wouldn’t expect to see <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>on Game Pass until the end of 2024 — at which point it would be overshadowed by the new game, anyway.</p>
<p id="5Tz9Go">Perhaps Microsoft wants to make the biggest splash possible by having the first Call of Duty title to hit Game Pass be 2024’s brand-new installment. Microsoft may choose to put a range of Call of Duty games on the service at the same time — or it might just focus on the big new release.</p>
<h2 id="jad0Js"><strong>When will other Activision Blizzard games like Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch come to Game Pass?</strong></h2>
<p id="7x1Elg">A clue to Microsoft’s strategy is its handling of Diablo games on Game Pass. Once again, many expected older games like <em>Diablo 3 </em>and <em>Diablo 2 Resurrected</em> to appear on Game Pass quite soon after the acquisition, but this didn’t happen. Instead, the latest release, <em>Diablo 4</em>, arrived with a splash in March 2024. It seems Microsoft is less focused on putting the whole Blizzard back catalog on Game Pass than it was with Bethesda.</p>
<p id="PQTJCT">One of the biggest unknowns is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>. The massively multiplayer game will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2024, but still enjoys a healthy audience which pays <em>WoW</em>’s own monthly subscription fee to play it. Will Microsoft be willing to cannibalize this revenue stream for the sake of what would be a unique and substantial value-add to Game Pass? Perhaps it will, but it’s a difficult calculation to make — so we wouldn’t expect to see it in the first wave of games added, if at all.</p>
<p id="i5wE9i">As for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/overwatch-2/40628"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, it’s a free-to-play game, so this is less relevant. But Game Pass subscribers have already received some perks for the title, including immediate unlocks for some of the game’s heroes.</p>
<p id="c8gqi7"><strong>Update (Oct. 13, 2023): </strong>This article has been updated to reflect the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard on Oct. 13.</p>
<p id="BDDJth"><strong>Update (Oct. 18, 2023): </strong>This article has been updated with comments from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.</p>
<p id="yB6Rus"><strong>Update (May 21, 2024): </strong>This article has been updated to reflect the addition of <em>Diablo 4</em> to Game Pass and reports that the next Call of Duty will come to the service.</p>

<p>After 20 years, PlayStation’s London studio has officially closed its doors. The closure comes as part as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-laying-off-900-employees-about-8-of-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced layoffs by Sony</a> that saw 900 people lose their jobs.</p>

<p>“As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years. We’ve had one wild and wonderful journey!”</p>



<p>Over its 20 years, PlayStation’s London Studio has been known for making games for the console’s EyeToy accessory in the mid-2000s before developing the SingStar franchise. It also developed a couple games for PlayStation VR: PlayStation VR Worlds and Blood &amp; Truth.</p>



<p>In 2024, the gaming industry has seen over 10,000 people lose their jobs in the first five months. In 2023, roughly 10,500 people lost their jobs within the industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like a thousand years have passed since Princess Peach first summoned Mario to the seedy city of Rogueport to hunt for the legendary treasure that sleeps beneath the town. In reality, it’s only been 20 since Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door graced the GameCube, but it seems longer because the Paper Mario series has abandoned its traditional turn-based RPG battles ever since. The Thousand-Year Door rapidly faded into legend, kept alive by the spoken word of longtime Nintendo fans who clung onto hope that it would one day open again. </p><p>Finally, that patience has paid off, as the Nintendo Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive version of this classic adventure. It unquestionably justifies why the original is so treasured, pairing a faithful recreation of one of Mario’s most iconic quests with a set of welcome additions and modern improvements that keep it feeling fresh off the printing press even two decades later. Just as Princess Peach tells Mario <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1775568951835083009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he MUST come to Rogueport</u></a>, I’m telling you that you MUST play The Thousand-Year Door.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>From its opening moments to the end credits, it’s still impressive how distinct this RPG feels from any other game in the wide Mario universe. The surprisingly gritty world of Rogueport and its surrounding towns, a lovable cast of offbeat partners Mario recruits along the way, and an Indiana Jones-style race between Mario and the scheming X-Nauts to unlock the secret behind the sleeping door give this journey an unforgettable identity that has passed the test of time with flying colors.</p><p>It helps that the Switch remake is absolutely gorgeous, with lovingly redone character models and dazzling environments that fully commit to the original’s papery, storybook aesthetic. It’s always a joy to look at, and the lighting in darker environments like Hooktail’s Castle, Boggly Woods, and Twilight Town is stunning. It maintains 30 frames per second very consistently, as I only noticed slight framerate dips in moments where the screen is flooded with hundreds of characters at once, but that doesn’t happen often so it never really bothered me. The revamped soundtrack is similarly amazing, with outstanding updated versions of the original tunes and new battle theme arrangements specific to each location.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sharp, laugh-out-loud script is consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004.</p></div><p>The exciting premise and artistic world are backed up by a sharp, laugh-out-loud script that’s consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004. The Thousand-Year Door wastes no time setting its comedic, irreverent tone: Just minutes after Mario sets foot in Rogueport, he’s witness to the town’s high crime rate as members of the Pianta Syndicate get in a brawl with their rival Robbo Thieves in the background. Almost every character does or says something hilarious that also serves the excellent worldbuilding, like the evil, cackling spirits who are convinced they’re cursing Mario for all eternity, when they’re actually blessing him with a useful upgrade. Side characters like those from the Pianta Syndicate and Robbo Thieves constantly intertwine with Mario’s journey, and some folks even email life updates to his Game Boy Advance SP-like phone with adorable photos of themselves attached. How thoughtful!</p><p>Small interludes also stand out, like ones where you play as Princess Peach while she’s held in captivity by the X-Nauts or as Bowser as he searches for the mythical treasure with his moronic band of minions. Some story elements from Princess Peach’s segments haven’t aged <em>super </em>gracefully – it plays up the fact that she has to take off her dress not one, not two, but <em>three </em>separate times across less than 30 total minutes of Peach gameplay – but it’s still fun to see how she assists Mario from afar. The Bowser sections offer a glimpse of how the King of the Koopas comically mismanages his dysfunctional army when he’s not getting tossed around by Mario.</p><p>Another clear highlight is bumping into Luigi throughout Rogueport, where he updates Mario on his parallel misadventures in the Waffle Kingdom. Mario can’t even stay awake to hear the whole story (poor Luigi!), but I love soaking up every word of it. This remake enhances the endearing dialogue even further, as developer Intelligent Systems replaced the generic typewriter text sound from the original with an amusing Animal Crossing-like babbling noise unique to each character type. It’s an impressive touch that shows a willingness to go above and beyond to polish this beloved tale.</p><p>Mario’s quest to collect the Crystal Stars before the X-Nauts do is the backdrop for each of the eight chapters, but some of the most unforgettable moments come from within the smaller stories that pop up. For example, one Crystal Star is the crown jewel of a wrestling championship belt, kicking off an incredible sequence where Mario – dubbed by his promoter as “The Great Gonzales” – climbs the ranks in the Glitz Pit’s cutthroat pro wrestling world. Every chapter has its own flavor like this, and it’s always delightful to see where Mario and friends will end up next.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>It’s Dangerous to Go Alone… Take Partners!</strong></h2><p>Speaking of friends, Mario’s party of seven partners is one of The Thousand-Year Door’s greatest strengths. Each character you recruit has a well-defined design and personality: Koops is an insecure, shy Koopa who musters up the courage to travel with Mario to avenge his father, while Goombella is a smart, sassy student at the University of Goom who’s interested in archaeology. Every chapter provides some backstory for the new companion it introduces that’s generally very sweet and oftentimes strikingly mature and emotionally resonant, which highlights how the series hasn’t managed to match their quality since. </p><p>When exploring, each partner helps out in a unique way: You can kick Koops’ shell to hit far-off switches, while Yoshi significantly increases your speed and can flutter across gaps. The remake’s new Partner Ring lets you change characters on the fly in the overworld, making some late-game puzzles that require lots of partner switching much snappier. And, there’s a robust new hint system you can access at any time where Goombella will tell you exactly what to do next. Some quests are a little bit obtuse at times, like when it’s unclear who exactly you need to talk with to advance the story, so that was a nice fallback that ensured I never got stuck.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Logan Ranks the Mario RPGs</h3><p>I'm not counting Mario + Rabbids because I haven't finished them yet!</p></div><p>Partners also fight alongside Mario during The Thousand-Year Door’s excellent turn-based battles. Paper Mario’s trademark Action Commands are here, where you deal more and take less damage if you properly time the correct button presses. But The Thousand-Year Door takes it much further than basic jumping, hammering, and blocking, spicing up its battles with a great Badge-based upgrade system and electric live audience so I never got tired of fighting at any point during the 30-hour campaign. </p><p>Collectable Badges – which are hidden throughout the world and on sale at Rogueport’s Lovely Howz of Badges – let you customize Mario’s abilities however you want as long as you have enough Badge Points to equip them. There are over 80 Badges to choose from: Some give Mario powerful new types of jump or hammer attacks, like the Quake Hammer, which attacks all non-flying enemies with one big smash. Other badges impact Mario’s stats, like the P-Up, D-Down Badge that boosts attack power but sacrifices defense. I turned my Mario into a glass cannon, to the point where perfect Action Commands disposed of enemies in a flash, but any mistake led to him taking serious damage. As a Paper Mario pro, I loved turning up the heat with my Badge builds to create more of a high-risk, high-reward balance, and it’s always fun to mix and match to try out different combinations if anything starts to feel stale. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pumping up the crowd is one of the coolest mechanics I’ve ever seen in an RPG.</p></div><p>It’s the live audience, though, that truly pushes battles to the next level. Lots of Nintendo games are presented as stage plays (a tradition going back to Super Mario Bros. 3 and most recently seen in Princess Peach: Showtime!), but The Thousand-Year Door has my favorite implementation of this idea. When a fight begins, Mushroom Kingdom citizens frantically rush into an auditorium to watch it unfold on stage, cheering when Mario does well and leaving early when things go poorly (are they trying to beat traffic?). Hecklers threaten to pelt Mario with rocks and stage lights or fog machines might malfunction during the battle, requiring a timely block. </p><p>Balancing fighting with appealing to the crowd is so dynamic, and it’s even more entertaining when you pull off the Stylish Moves that add flourishes to attacks and make the crowd go wild. Mario can backflip after pulling off a Hammer attack, or Koops can breakdance after rushing through a line of enemies in his shell. Pumping up the crowd through well-executed Action Commands and Stylish Moves fills up Mario’s special attack meter, and it’s one of the coolest mechanics I’ve ever seen in an RPG. The fights aren’t especially difficult – with the exception of some late-game bosses and optional challenges like the returning Pit of 100 Trials – but keeping track of all the mechanics at play during battle meant I never fell into a repetitive rut where I stopped having to think. If you love punishment, the Double Pain Badge doubles the amount of damage Mario takes, but besides that there aren’t traditional difficulty options to be found here. On the flipside, if you’re a Paper Mario rookie and want to improve your skills, the new Battle Master Toad hanging out in most towns lets you practice your Action Command timing whenever you like with no penalty for messing up.</p><h2><strong>There and Back Again</strong></h2><p>The Thousand-Year Door’s one major flaw I wish this remake had done more to fix is the main quest’s overreliance on backtracking. Most areas have two major points of interest separated by several linear pathways, and the campaign frequently forces you to travel back and forth between them multiple times over the course of a chapter.</p><p>Adventures on the pirate island of Keelhaul Key and in the spooky Twilight Town are especially bad about this. These chapters make Mario travel all the way to the edge of an area, realize he doesn’t have the means to progress further, walk back to the town he started in to get something, then return, and so on. It’s about as much fun as realizing you forgot your wallet as you pull into the movie theater parking lot. The new Partner Ring means your trusty Yoshi steed is more accessible than ever, so at least it’s quicker to run back and forth than it was on GameCube, but that’s a half measure when it comes to fixing the level design, which is noticeably outdated in a remake that otherwise feels pretty modern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do wish more had been done to fix the overreliance on backtracking.</p></div><p>To its credit, Intelligent Systems made several changes to at least somewhat address the backtracking problem without fundamentally changing the original’s design. In Keelhaul Key, a helpful new spring shortcut means you only have to do an annoying section of precise Yoshi platforming once, rather than every time the chapter asks you to go back and forth across its screens. So they removed the painful part, but not the actual trek.</p><p>It’s not as if major changes were unthinkable, because The Thousand-Year Door has some big ones elsewhere, the best of which is its revamped Warp Pipe Room. This fast-travel hub opens up underneath Rogueport a few chapters in, and it’s a total game changer for quests that make you revisit previous locations. In the original, the only way to get to the Glitz Pit was to ride the blimp all the way on the far side of Rogueport. Now, there’s a pipe that zips you straight there, and it’s conveniently labeled in a room filled with pipes that lead back to the central locations from every chapter. Similarly, longtime fans will remember that Chapter 7 contains a particularly ridiculous quest that requires revisiting every major town in the world, but with the help of the new-and-improved Warp Pipe Room I was done with this mission in less than 10 minutes. It wasn’t a particularly stellar 10 minutes in terms of actual entertainment, but it was a lot less tedious than what I’d been braced for. </p><p>Even if solutions like this feel like putting makeup on a blemish that we all can tell is still there,<strong> </strong>I respect the decision to keep this remake extremely faithful, and the combat, story, music, and graphics are so much fun that I really don’t mind the back-and-forth exploration too much. And thankfully, you don’t see any tedium in the fantastic dungeons, which are packed with interesting puzzles, collectibles, and epic boss fights that shake up the usual battle conventions in interesting, cinematic ways. Mario also learns clever paper abilities throughout the campaign, like turning into a paper airplane or rolling up into a tube, and those open up new shortcuts and secrets in the Rogueport Sewers to give exploration an almost metroidvania-like feel at times.</p><p>Outside of the main campaign, the entirely optional side quests are your pretty standard RPG fetch-quest fare. Sometimes they’re good for a laugh, like a mouse who asks Mario to whack him with his hammer over and over again until he remembers something important, but from a reward standpoint they’re largely skippable because they <em>mostly</em> give you items or coins that can easily be found elsewhere. I also dislike the side quest system: Mario can only accept one at a time from Rogueport’s Trouble Center, and you must solve or abandon it before taking on a new task. If this remake is already trying to make things more convenient, why not let us take on multiple quests at once to cut down on the number of times completionists will have to walk back and pick up a new one? As it stands, they don’t seem worth doing… with the exception of <em>one </em>extremely worthwhile reward I won’t spoil here.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

They've all been given a fantastic visual makeover, but thanks to the game making use of original assets, you can switch back to the blocky original graphics if you're feeling nostalgic.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-kitty-big-city-players-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie feline adventure&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>has crossed two major milestones after less than two weeks on sale, which will likely make developer Double Dagger Studio very happy indeed.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the studio <a href="https://x.com/LittleKittyGame/status/1792634871749230934" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that its adorable open-world sandbox game has crossed a million Game Pass players, which isn't surprising given that it's one of the highlights of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-may-2024-games">May's Game Pass lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Double Dagger also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>has passed the 200,000 sales mark. It took the game just a little over a week to achieve that goal, which is pretty impressive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-game-pass-players-sales-fish.jpg?itok=nVYa-J5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-game-pass-players-sales-fish.jpg?itok=jke6cnjO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>is a popular game, and it's no wonder. I mean, look at the cat!</figcaption></figure><p>The sales figure is even more commendable given that it's in addition to the game's Game Pass player count, which means 200,000 players knew&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>&nbsp;was available via Game Pass and bought it anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not surprised&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty&nbsp;</em>has proven so popular; it's a very sweet little game with arguably the cutest protagonist since&nbsp;<em>Stray</em>'s little friend. If you're a big fan of cats, you need to check it out.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, it's a sandbox adventure game set in an unnamed city (which looks very much like it's somewhere in Japan, given its structure and features like painted manhole covers).</p>

<p>One day, while you're napping in your favorite spot just outside your highrise apartment's window, you find yourself plummeting to the ground (painlessly!), and you must find your way home, all while interacting with a cast of colorful and quirky animal characters.</p>




<p>Activities you can engage with in&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty&nbsp;</em>include batting plant pots off ledges, playing with your own tail, and causing humans to drop their stuff so you can steal it for your own nefarious feline purposes.</p>

<p><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1177980/Little_Kitty_Big_City/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/little-kitty-big-city/9nf5s7mlm8xt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Little-Kitty-Big-City-2372180.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's also available via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.</p>

  <p id="nOO5gf">Polygon is proud to reveal that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/5/30/18642763/batman-last-knight-on-earth-joker">Greg Capullo</a> will be drawing the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23661676/marvel-comics-gods-hickman-x-men">Jonathan Hickman</a>-written miniseries <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em>, thereby solving one of the enduring mysteries of 2024 in comics. </p>
<p id="jg5HI8">All the way back in January, Capullo tweeted <a href="https://aiptcomics.com/2024/01/04/greg-capullo-wolverine-x-men/">a peek at a mystery Marvel project</a> that didn’t have any particularly identifying details in it — except, as perceptive fans immediately noticed, that it appeared to be titled “Wolverine.” The conclusion was clear: Capullo, a storied talent for his work on <em>X-Force</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/23273324/new-batman-spawn-comic-con-todd-mcfarlane-greg-capullo"><em>Spawn</em></a> in the 1990s and a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/6/15208506/batman-dc-comics-dark-nights-metal">50-issue run on <em>Batman</em></a> in the 2010s, was returning to Marvel to draw a Wolverine series. </p>
<p id="pu7IdZ">Perhaps he’d even be drawing <em>the</em> Wolverine series of this summer’s <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/x-men-summer-2024-titles-creative-teams">relaunch of the X-Men line</a>? The mystery thickened this month when Marvel announced a new <em>Wolverine</em> ongoing from writer Saladin Ahmed and artist Martín Cóccolo — with no Capullo to be seen. </p>
<p id="ZmCnhs">Polygon can now share the actual Wolverine series Capullo is working on, <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em>, with Krakoan Era architect Jonathan Hickman penning the story. </p>

<p id="9A1eX1">“I’ve finally returned home to Marvel and I’m ready to raise some Hell,” Capullo told Polygon via email. “And, who better to do that with than the Hitman Hickman? To celebrate, Marvel has removed the fences and let us off our leash so that we can bring the most vicious and punishing Wolverine story possible to the fans this summer. I hope they’re prepared.”</p>
<p id="YUqSJ1">In five issues, <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em> promises to “pit WOLVERINE against a cadre of foes who will turn his world upside down!” according to Marvel’s official summary. “He’s been beaten! He’s been bloodied! And LOGAN only has one thought on his mind: REVENGE!” </p>
<p id="RYQIkd">Preview pages from the first issue (read ’em below!) show Logan hunting alongside the Zebra People of the Savage Land and battling a dinosaur in a truly classic bit of Marvel action. </p>
<p id="N0kGUZ">“Well, obviously it’s such a privilege to get to work with a legend like Greg,” said Hickman via email. “When we first talked about the project, our number one concern was taking the readers on a high-octane, no-hold-barred Wolverine story that was a proper celebration of both the character and Greg returning to Marvel. And like he said, the bosses cut us loose and the result is an absolutely wild book. Honestly can’t wait for everyone to get to check it out.”</p>
<p id="3l9Cl0">Hickman and Capullo are not kidding about being let off the leash. <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em> #1 will also be published in a “red band” edition, containing some pages not included in the regular edition, with “elevated violence you won’t see anywhere else!” according to Marvel’s news release. The red band version of the issue will be polybagged “for the protection of innocent eyes!” </p>
<p id="RT4CCW">Both versions of the issue will hit shelves on Aug. 21, with a main cover by Capullo. </p>

It’s arguable that the team’s current approach of just making awful decisions as loudly as possible isn’t doing enormous good for its reputation. Last month saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-dlc-unheard-edition-1851441954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-dlc-unheard-edition-1851441954">a new PvE mode for the first-person shooter gated behind a $250 paywall</a></span>—made even worse by having previously sold a $150 <em>Edge of Darkness </em>edition that had promised all future DLC—all then halfway reneged by offering a confusing $50 upgrade for those affected. Except a whole bunch of people had already forked out the full $100. Now, how could this situation be made worse?</p><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,195840,195624" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>What about, instead of refunding those people the $50 they clearly deserve, Battlestate could instead <em>keep</em> that money, and give them a voucher worth $50 of in-game content?! But wait! It gets  much dumber.</p><p>The amount of money players of <em>Tarkov</em> are willing to spend is quite astonishing. People who bought the eight-year-old game when its perpetual Early Access first began have been willingly buying it over and over ever since, presumably out of loyalty and a desire to support a project they love. However, April’s clusterfuck undid an enormous amount of goodwill, as people who’d already paid the most astonishingly large sum to guarantee access to all future DLC had assumed—not unreasonably—that this would also include newly added features. So a response of “It ain’t DLC” (actual quote) wasn’t exactly the customer support they were after.</p><p>The situation is incredibly muddled, such that while Battlestate eventually backed down to the degree that they said PvE would <em>eventually</em> be included for <em>Edge of Darkness</em> owners, it’s only “in waves,” with no firm deadline for when this might happen. Those still wanting to jump the queue were first told they needed to upgrade to (or entirely buy) the $250 <em>The Unheard Edition</em>, and so of course, many did. Days later it was announced that <em>EoD</em> owners would now need to “only” pay $50 for the upgrade, despite still fully believing they had already bought the ultimate edition of the game.</p><p>And for all those who’d paid the $100 in the interim? In any functioning universe, Battlestate would have said, “Of course we’ll refund those who paid double,” an act that would still be a struggle to call decent, given <em>EoD</em> owners should have been fully entitled to the update in the first place. This is not that universe, and instead the company is offering people a one-time $50 voucher for <em>Tarkov </em>content, that amazingly comes with ludicrous strings attached!</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tarkov/status/1791452217402180032&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1791452217402180032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A statement posted to X.com</a></span><em> </em>(formerly a less hellish social media site) by Battlestate explains the outrageous limitations. “Please note,” it sneaks in mid-paragraph, “that you can only use the compensation once: if the cost of all the expansions you have selected is lower than the compensation, the remaining balance cannot be used later.”</p><p>Yeah, not only do people not get the money they’ve overpaid, but should they want to pick up a $30 expansion, they can kiss the other $20 goodbye. And if you’re wondering why, say, Steam doesn’t get involved, <em>Tarkov </em>remarkably isn’t on Steam, instead sold direct by Battlestate.</p><p>It beggars belief that a situation could be handled this poorly. We’ve reached out to Battlestate to ask why this is all happening when simply honoring the <em>Edge of Darkness</em> edition and paying people back their money would do so much to restore the game’s damaged reputation.</p><p>Still though, as a nice treat, players are getting two extra lines on their stash size, worth a whopping $3, so that’ll probably calm things down.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players can take on the Pit to earn crafting materials Obducite, Ingolith, and Neathiron, which are used to unlock successively higher ranks of masterwork. </p>

<p>While you have to progress through the Pit to unlock the rarer materials--with Ingolith only dropping between Tier 31 and Tier 60 of the dungeon, and Neathiron from Tier 61 up--players can transmute extra high-level materials to one of lower rarity at the Alchemist.</p><p>The latest patch dramatically reduces the gold cost of this process, with the most expensive transmutation, the Large Ingolith Cache, reduced from 6,000,000 gold to just 60,000. The other caches have seen similar reductions, with the cheapest Small Obducite Cache starting at just 1000 gold. The other material costs have remained unchanged, with one Neathiron still transmuting to three Ingolith, and one Ingolith transmuting to three Obducite.</p><p>The newest patch also introduces "various performance and stability improvements," according to the patch notes, which can be read in full below.</p><p>The main Diablo 4 Loot Reborn patch has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-going-over-very-well-with-fans/1100-6523491/" data-ref-id="1100-6523491">well-received by players</a>, which is likely linked to Blizzard's decision to playtest the patch using a PTR before releasing it to the public. While some elements may not have received universal praise, like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-community-warns-that-latest-patch-changed-how-item-salvaging-works/1100-6523489/" data-ref-id="1100-6523489">change to the Salvage All Items feature</a> which may have seen players accidentally getting rid of rare and valuable items, Diablo fans are generally on board with the direction the latest game is taking.</p><p>Diablo 4 is in line for its first major expansion later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-coming-late-2024/1100-6518910/" data-ref-id="1100-6518910">Vessel of Hatred</a>, which Blizzard teased with imagery of a lush, jungle-like setting.</p><h2>1.4.0b Build #53811 (All Platforms)</h2><h4>Game Updates</h4><ul><li>The amount of gold it costs to transmute Masterworking material caches has been significantly reduced.</li></ul><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><ul><li>Various performance and stability improvements.</li></ul>

        <p>The developer's closure comes months after Sony announced global layoffs</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>PlayStation's London Studio has officially closed its doors today.</p>
<p>The Sony subsidiary posted <a href="https://x.com/LondonStudioHQ/status/1792872997167984733">an official statement on social media</a>, marking the end of its more than 20-year operations.</p>
<p>"For over twenty years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry," said the studio.</p>
<p>"As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years. We've had one wild and wonderful journey."</p>
<p>Since its establishment, PlayStation's London Studio has developed games such as The Getaway, Gangs of London, and SingStar Ultimate Party. It has also worked on titles such as Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>
<p>Additionally it was one of Sony's most experimental teams as it worked on EyeToy, Wonderbook and then VR.</p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-playstation-london-studio-is-leaving-vr-to-create-a-fantasy-online-combat-game">GamesIndustry.biz spoke with co-studio head Stuart Whyte</a> as the developer pivoted from VR to an untitled online co-op title.</p>
<p>The game maker's closure comes months after Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it would be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-lay-off-900-playstation-workers">laying off 900 staffers of its global workforce</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/21/the-entire-kingdom-hearts-saga-comes-to-steam-next-month<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enix has announced that several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month. Three compilations, and a compilation of those compilations, will bring the entire “Dark Seeker Saga” to Valve’s storefront.</p>

<p>On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece (bundle that includes all the above compilations)</p>

<p>If you’re jumping into the series for the first time or returning from a long absence and have no idea how to decipher the bizarre names of these titles, here’s what each game includes:</p>

<p><strong>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts: Re:Coded (HD remastered cinematics)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A Fragmentary Passage-</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover (movie)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts III</li>
	<li>Re Mind DLC</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/11/the-kingdom-hearts-franchise-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store">Epic Game Store since 2021</a>. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer">Kingdom Hearts IV</a>.</p>

<p>The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/13/square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-multiplatform-strategy-in-company-reboot">“aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy</a> after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/13/square-enix-will-begin-layoffs-as-part-of-structural-reforms-this-week">swath of layoffs</a> across its California and UK offices last week.</p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’m not one for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-is-insistent-on-not-adding-permanent-new-career-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FOMO</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature deprecation</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-bungie-no-more-sunset-expansions-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content sunsetting</a>. Time and again, I’ve voiced my opinions on these matters, but the schtick keeps rearing its ugly head quite often. The latest (potential) victim? Fishing in Destiny 2, believe it or not, is as beloved as it might be.</p> <p data-characters="651" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-go-fishing-in-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> introduced fishing</a> into its eclectic mix of activities during the Season of the Deep. Veteran players will know that this was, essentially, during the height of the community’s unhappiness with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lets-look-at-the-biggest-destiny-2-lightfall-issues-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Bungie was handling the year of <em>Lightfall</em></a>. As such, this simple little activity became a bit of a highlight in trying times, even if it wasn’t hugely significant in the grand scheme of things. It’s a bit of a bummer, then, that Bungie <em>appears</em> to be looking to sunset fishing in <em>Destiny 2</em> with the release of <em>The Final Shape</em> DLC, as per its recently updated “Items Being Deprecated at the Start of Year 7” <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/25896964261396-Items-Being-Deprecated-at-the-Start-of-Year-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webpage</a>.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-fishing-system-is-being-deprecated-in-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2’s fishing system is being ‘deprecated’ in The Final Shape</h2> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="790" data-injectable="true">Now, the only reason why I’m saying “probably” is that Bungie is yet to chime in on the matter of sunsetting the fishing mini-game in<em> Destiny 2</em>. The studio is very well aware of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pretty-much-the-entire-destiny-2-community-has-turned-on-the-sunsetting-content-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the community’s stance on content sunsetting</a>, and it’s certainly possible that the feature will be brought back in some form down the line. As per the blog mentioned above, though, the Fishing Tackle is one of the items that will be 100% unavailable after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out.</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">This shouldn’t come as a surprise, perhaps. As widely accepted and celebrated as the recent <em>Into the Light</em> content drop might’ve been, for one, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/most-destiny-2-into-the-light-will-sunset-with-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a huge chunk of it will be carved out of the game with <em>The Final Shape</em></a> as well. Most notably, this includes the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-destiny-2-player-has-soloed-the-raid-boss-run-pantheon-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pantheon boss-run mode</a>, which is one of those things <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frft3e/destiny_2_should_have_a_boss_rush_mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/pdp037/it_will_probably_never_happen_but_i_would/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have </a><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1bu5wax/i_have_always_wanted_a_raid_boss_gauntlet_and_now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wanted</a> access to for quite a long while now. At least the horde survival/defense mode is bound to stick around, I suppose?</p>
 <p data-characters="568" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">One thing I’d like to highlight here is that I don’t even like fishing in <em>Destiny 2</em>. It just doesn’t feel like it fits into the game properly, especially now as the Guardians prepare for their final clash with The Witness and its Dread faction. Still, I hate to see the activity being yanked out of the game. Especially one that’s as innocuous and inoffensive as this. Who knows: the Fishing Tackle may end up being reintroduced at some point in the future. Perhaps even as a timed exclusive, as Bungie suggested might happen with the Pantheon.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Whatever the case may be, the good news is that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Destiny 2</em> community is now calm and collected</a>, just weeks away from <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s grand release. From the looks of it, everyone is waiting to see if this is yet another <em>Lightfall</em>, or if we’re looking at something along the lines of <em>The Taken King</em>, <em>Forsaken</em>, or <em>Witch Queen</em>, as Bungie’s been promising all along. </p>

If you want to use your valuable currency properly, you will need to know whether you should pull for Jiyan or Yinlin or if it is worth being a big spender and going for both.</p> <h2 id="h-should-you-pull-for-jiyan-or-yinlin" data-injectable="false">Should you pull for Jiyan or Yinlin?</h2> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false"><strong>You should pull for Jiyan</strong> if you want a strong, focused DPS character to act as your main battle DPS, and <strong>you should pull for Yinlin</strong> if you already have a strong DPS that needs to be backed up by solid support. This is a really simplified version of what you should do, but it’s also the best way to look at things. </p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">One important thing to note is that all these opinions are based on beta builds and that some buffs are coming in the full release. I’ll update my thoughts accordingly based on those buffs, but I’m not expecting anything too wild to happen.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Because both characters are available so early in the lifetime of Wuthering Waves, you really need to consider which of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-5-star-selector-character-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-Star Selector characters</a> you went for. For example, Calcharo is a great damage character and could be easily backed up with Yinlin. Meanwhile, Jianxin is a good all-around character who could back up Jiyan nicely if you opt for the paring, or Verina would be an excellent dedicated support for Jiyan and could buff his DPS.</p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">As such, I would break it down like this:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false"> <li>If you go for Verina or Jianxin from the 5-Star Selector, then Jiyan makes a lot of sense as they can back him up pretty well.</li> <li>If you go for Calcharo from the 5-Star Selector, then Yinlin makes a lot of sense. Yinlin also likely has a strong life in the game, as she can back up ANY damage character, so you are likely to get more value from resources invested in her.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">The other factor to think about here is the 4 Star characters. You are likely to rack up a couple of them, at least, before you get your hands on the 5 Star that you want. Danjin, Mortefi, and Chixia are all on the banner, and Mortefi works really well with Jiyan, so there is some built-in synergy in this Banner. The only real downside to Jiyan as the center of your team will be that his single target damage is not as good as it would be against groups, as he can gather up enemies and dump them all in one spot to damage them all with the same attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">If you are worried about boss fights, Calcharo is better, and using Yinlin to back him up would work a lot. There is also an argument to be made here that there is less synergy within this Banner overall. That said, if you plan on running the deeper difficulties of content early, then you will just need different characters to make up teams, so you might want to pull on both Banners.</p> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Important things to remember for early pulls</h2> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">If there is one thing we have seen in a multitude of other games, it is that character power is not set in stone. You can spend a lot of time, money, or effort to get a character and then see them nerfed into the ground later or dismiss a character who is buffed to instant proportions after a few updates.</p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">It can also be easy to get weapons and equipment for characters that we just don’t know about yet that can really change the appeal of a character with some testing. Finally, at this stage, we just don’t have enough information about the build that is about to go live to make firm decisions right now. </p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false"><strong>The best advice I can give you, for now, is that the Jiyan will be around until mid-June, so it might be better to wait and play the game for a while to figure things out and then proceed from there.</strong> You have time to figure things out a bit and learn what you want from your characters and teams before you need to commit to spending resources on anything. </p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="false">Finally, one of the most important elements is to pull the character that you like the most. If a playstyle appeals to you, or you like the character art and voices, then just buy in. As much as I enjoy the math behind these games, trying to get the most out of everything, and a bit of min-maxing, I still think you need to put fun first. I am a Razor main in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, after all. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-terrorism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s hard to think of a more iconic opening sequence in RPG history than the intro of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. After a CG cutscene that was groundbreaking in 1997 and still slaps today, the game quickly makes its intent clear: the player is here at Midgar’s Sector 1 Mako reactor to do terrorism.</p><p><strong>This article contains spoilers for the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>FFVII Remake</em>  and <em>FFVII Rebirth</em></strong></p><p>The explosive sequence that follows sets up the game’s initial conflict between the planet-killing capitalists of the Shinra Electric Power Company—who are literally extracting the world’s life force for profit—and Avalanche, a resistance group clearly modeled after real-world environmental activists like the Earth Liberation Front (ELF). But unlike many games released at the time, <em>FFVII</em> starts off by firmly establishing the eco-saboteurs as the good guys.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s main conflict has been on my mind while watching university students protest Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza. The protests emerged on campuses across the country several months after the release of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and while I normally find it cringe to reflect on real world horrors through the lens of video games, the timing of the uprisings—and how they’ve unfolded—made it impossible for me to ignore the political impact of the original <em>FFVII</em>.</p><p>Nearly everyone I’ve ever talked to who played <em>FFVII </em>growing up has told me that its opening scene was a pivotal moment in their political awakening. In 1997, the idea that militant insurrection is sometimes necessary to create political change hadn’t really been explored in a major video game before. Even those that dallied in the topic hadn’t so viscerally placed players in the role of protagonists engaged in violent resistance, or made clear why they believe these actions are moral and justified.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 80s and 90s, the ELF’s militant actions included sabotaging industrial equipment and defacing corporate property, causing material and economic damage to those responsible for environmental destruction. This made them one of the first groups to be targeted by the US government as so-called eco-terrorists, inspiring the “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Scare</a>” and new laws that later became the framework for the government’s ever-expanding “War on Terrorism.” There was debate at the time over whether or not the methods of these groups were effective or too extreme. But in <em>FFVII</em>, the stakes are made clear: The planet is literally dying, and blowing up a reactor whose sole function facilitates this ecocide is a practical and material response to avoid, or at least delay, a world-ending global cataclysm.</p><p>My goal here is not to compare a fictional resistance struggle with Palestine’s 75-year anti-colonial struggle or with the international movement that has risen in support of it. But as a Jewish woman who used to identify as a hardcore, pro-Israel Zionist, replaying <em>FFVII</em>’s story via <em>Remake</em> and <em>Rebirth</em> has made me realize how deeply this game’s ideas resonate—and how many of them went completely over my head as a kid.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@starlordziggy/video/7295005161183890730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common criticism</a> goes like this: Many people empathize with the goals of fictional resistance groups like Avalanche, but can’t seem to connect the dots when it comes to the real-world resistance struggles they’re based on. This has always fascinated me. <em>FFVII </em>not only forced players to consider the righteousness of militant actions, but illustrated two of the most important ways that real-world governments historically respond to them: first, by using the media to scapegoat and smear resistance groups and their supporters, and second, by enacting disproportionate violence as a form of collective punishment.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows the state to project the consequences of its own violent excess onto its political enemies, thus justifying further violence against them. Shinra’s destruction of Sector 7 in the original <em>FFVII </em>is the most obvious and extreme example, but <em>Remake</em> takes this a step further, changing the story to show that it was actually Shinra—and not Avalanche—responsible for the deadly aftermath of the reactor bombing in the game’s opening. Monsters—which Shinra protects some, but not all, of its citizens from—are also a result of the company’s experiments to create biological weapons of war. Even Sephiroth, who fully replaces Shinra as the game’s main antagonist in <em>Rebirth</em>, is a living reminder that the apocalyptic crisis the world faces is a direct result of a fascist government’s insatiable greed and colonial ambition. Without Shinra, after all, there would be no Sephiroth.</p><p>Characters on the pro-Shinra side, meanwhile, describe the company at best as a necessary evil. The power of Mako quite literally keeps the lights on in Midgar, and most citizens can’t imagine living without it. This always reminds me of something I was taught early on in my Zionist education: the idea that a powerful nation-state is necessary to ensure our safety. I was taught that violence done in my name—the details of which were often omitted or obscured—is unfortunate but justified. Like many young Jews, I learned about the Holocaust from a very early age, and this was all the proof I needed to know that our comfort and way of life—our very survival as Jews, I was told—was at stake.</p><figure></figure><p>It wasn’t until later in life that I began to see holes in this narrative, which weaponizes generational trauma to manufacture consent for state violence. It started by reading the many historical examples of resistance groups, and how they’re often painted as criminals and terrorists who seek only to destroy the average citizen’s way of life. We’ve seen that narrative a lot in recent weeks, as police and university administrators inflict violence on students protesting genocide while demolishing their encampments. The news media and politicians use their platforms to snarl at students and their allies, calling them “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/01/new-york-mayor-outside-agitators-columbia-protest-00155581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outside agitators</a>,” “<a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/elections/2024/04/steve-garvey-gaza-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrorists</a>,” or <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2024/05/02/bloodthirsty-tom-cotton-is-going-to-get-someone-killed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse</a>. In early May, President Joe Biden admonished the student protesters, declaring that “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-silence-college-protests-police-gaza-israel-d5f3092671951c3bc2968b8751c93ba6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order must prevail</a>” and stating—<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Haymarket-Affair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahistorically</a> and without a <a href="https://twitter.com/akela_lacy/status/1786058411026665628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hint of irony</a>—that “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/02/remarks-by-president-biden-on-recent-events-on-college-campuses/#:~:text=Threatening%20people%2C%20intimidating%20people%2C%20instilling,semester%20and%20their%20college%20education." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dissent must never lead to disorder</a>.”</p><p>Such declarations rarely, if ever, stand the test of time. The “order” that Biden is demanding is the very same that Martin Luther King, Jr. excoriated in his <a href="https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Letter From Birmingham Jail</a>, where he famously described “the white moderate [...] who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.” The “negative peace,” in this case, being the comfort of school administrators and pro-Israel faculty amidst a complete absence of safety and justice for Palestinians in Gaza, where <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/details-humanitarian-crisis-gaza-2024-05-01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every last university and approximately 62 percent of homes have been destroyed</a> by Israeli occupation forces, using US weapons and funding. As always, those calling for this “peace” are in reality calling for a status quo that prioritizes their feelings of comfort in the imperial core over the lives of those who suffer the violence of the state.</p><p>Those condemning the protesters also use the predictable and age-old tactic of declaring pro-Palestinian demonstrations “antisemitic.” I’m intimately familiar with this narrative, because I was taught it as a teen. The explicit goal is to conflate any criticism of the Israeli state with hatred of Jews—something the US Congress is currently <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/05/antisemitism-bill-bund-jewish-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempting to codify into law</a>. This <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-israel-agitator-shouts-kill-the-jews-gets-everyone-else-arrested" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false</a> idea attempts to justify an eliminationist campaign in Gaza that has already killed over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">35,000 Palestinians</a>, completely <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/another-hospital-gaza-forced-close-amid-intensified-israeli-offensive-rafah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroyed the majority of hospitals</a>, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/the-un-says-theres-full-blown-famine-in-northern-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">created an artificial famine</a> by cutting off <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/trending/israel-settlers-destroy-gaza-aid-spark-outrage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aid and medical supplies</a>.</p><p>History shows us again and again that balancing the comfort and safety of one group atop the destruction and oppression of another never goes well for anyone involved. Those who cheer on state violence against resistance movements are not remembered fondly, and the extraction and exploitation of colonial powers <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opensecurity/foucaults-boomerang-new-military-urbanism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually comes back to haunt</a> those it was supposedly done to benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>Shinra served as an early guidepost in my understanding of how these oppressive powers think and act. Although the conglomerate falls into the background as a secondary rival throughout most of <em>FFVII</em>, every societal ill the player encounters can be traced back to it. In a polarizing scene toward the end of the game, Avalanche leader Barret Wallace does a surprising mea culpa, expressing regret for the group’s reactor bombing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M-Xf26EAqs0?feature=shared&amp;t=35427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This scene</a> always struck me as good character development, but also forced and awkward. While Barret and crew wouldn’t be the good guys if they didn’t care how their actions might harm others, the speech seems to miss the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p><p>By forcing the planet to a point of crisis, Shinra guarantees the undoing of its world order and all the mess that comes with it, including Avalanche. When the very ideas of “order” and “peace” become cover for a controlled decline that inevitably leads to disaster, the only options remaining are to either accept that fate, or oppose it by any means necessary. We see glimpses of a reality that “has accepted its fate” in one of <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>’s multiverse timelines, where ex-SOLDIER Zack returns to Midgar as the last remaining Mako is drained from the planet. These are some of the bleakest scenes in the game, both because the citizens of Midgar have lost all hope, and because Shinra’s soldiers nonetheless continue to maintain “order” as everyone awaits their demise—an extinction event that Shinra itself has orchestrated.</p><p>Shinra may be a fictional world government from a video game about magical twinks with giant swords, but it draws vividly from a history of real-world imperialism. That history shows us that sometimes, states must be pushed to the brink in order for any real change to occur. Before being assassinated by Israeli forces in 2017, Palestinian activist Bassel al-Araj <a href="https://www.thebadside.net/tbs-2-exiting-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “The beginning of every revolution is an exit, an exit from the social order that power has enshrined in the name of law, stability, public interest, and the greater good.”</p><p>This “exit” is necessarily destabilizing and scary, and no one’s safety can be guaranteed during the struggle that ensues. But the only alternative to building a better world in the unknown is to accept the world we’re already in—calmly waiting until the Lifestream runs dry.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Traversing the nightmare realms of the human mind has always been central to horror. The stories we tell ourselves about what’s moving in the darkness, the creation of monsters out of unknown sounds — from this emerges our fascination with terror. In <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, players navigate a cold, dark ninth-century Iceland in the often wet shoes of the Pictish warrior Senua on her second adventure in the third-person action-horror franchise. I was very fond of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">the first <em>Hellblade</em></a>, which saw Senua journey into Hel to save the soul of her lover. But the sequel pulled me in even further, with some of the most unforgettable and unsettling psychological horror I’ve ever experienced.</p><p>Senua, who lives with psychosis that causes her to hear constant voices, is a fierce warrior who has “killed” gods before in her personal quests at redemption. Cast out by her people in the Orkney Islands for being different, or a “witch,” she has taken her battles across the sea to rescue her people from slavers.</p><p>She washes up alone on a cold Viking shore and must find her way through a mysterious land. Her aim, vaguely, has to do with getting her people back, if not stopping the slavers who are taking her people. She soon discovers this is a land of literal giants, who remind me slightly of <em>Attack on Titan</em>: their designs are horrific and genuinely terrifying. The giants have all but destroyed the land, but Senua, being who she is, finds a way to stop them.</p><p>Let me be clear: this is the best-looking game I’ve ever played. Senua’s face is so detailed, I struggled to discern the real-time gameplay from the cutscenes; the environmental details are so intricate, it was like looking at photos. With fantastical lighting, inversions of the world as Senua is sucked into various states of mind, and stunning cinematic direction, there was no moment when I was not ogling my TV.</p><p>Perhaps more important, however, is the sound design and direction. The voices in Senua’s head portray themselves as furies, gods, and spirits, alternating between berating and encouraging. In terms of game design, they help the player navigate the world — telling you to look in this direction, highlighting when an enemy is about to hit, and so on. Add to this beautiful and horrific soundscapes, with chanting voices or drone-like sounds puncturing the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The world is alive with horror, as it was difficult to discern what was “real” and what was Senua’s psychosis. This is illustrated in combat: Senua is an incredible warrior but the game bookmarks combat. What I mean is that, when a battle happens, you are locked on to a single enemy where you must parry, block, and strike. Senua has an ability called “focus” that builds up with successful blocks and strikes, which is effectively bullet time with swords. Combat is exhausting and the one weak spot of the game, as I always felt she was not responsive to my blocks and parries, resulting in constant strikes from enemies. Senua has no health bar and it is rather hard to die, but the combat proved frustrating even if it was incredible to witness: it’s brutal and dynamic, with fights happening around Senua, enemies crashing into her organically, and kills blending smoothly into cutscenes.</p><p>Unlike the first game, Senua has companions whom I genuinely grew to like: a spiritual leader; a reformed slaver; and the daughter of a betrayed chief. Villages are filled with people, with one sequence showing off a small battalion fighting alongside Senua. However, Senua remains inherently alone, and the journey is a lonely one — despite the voices constantly in your head. Senua solves environmental puzzles to navigate the world, which, like the first game, did get a little repetitive. These involve her having to match shapes that unlock doors. However, there was at least more diversity to the puzzles this time to keep things interesting, aside from the boring shape minigame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The game is short, and I finished it in about 10 hours. But it packs a number of gorgeous scenes and scenarios into that brief span, from battling a monster in a volcano pit to the rhythm of metal music to navigating a <em>Silent Hill</em>-esque forest. This was an exhausting, beautiful experience that shattered me often, built me back up, and constantly challenged what it meant to manage one’s darkness. Senua is a broken person, but because of that, she fits into this broken world.</p><p><small>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II <em>is available now on Xbox and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161472/nintendo-shiver-acquisition-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="4YYJMG">In a move that has surprised literally everyone, Nintendo has made a studio acquisition. In a rare move, the company bought Shiver Entertainment, a Miami-based port specialist, from embattled Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group.</p>
<p id="hGDqN1">Shiver, notably, is the studio that somehow managed to bring both <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>and <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>to Nintendo Switch in 2023. Given the enormous gulf in power between the Switch and the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, this was no easy task, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23878568/mortal-kombat-1-nintendo-switch-graphics-frame-rate-loading">results left quite a lot to be desired</a>. But merely getting feature-complete and functional versions of these games up and running on Switch could be considered an achievement in itself.</p>
<p id="7u6xDA">At any rate, Shiver’s work seems to have impressed Nintendo enough that it took the unusual step (for Nintendo) of dipping into its vast cash reserves and actually buying something. (Nintendo is actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/nintendo-is-currently-the-richest-company-in-japan">the richest company in Japan</a>, going by money in the bank, perhaps precisely because it never spends on itself. Historically, the company has been quite uninterested in late capitalism’s obsession with growth above all else, preferring good, old-fashioned profit — and Scrooge McDuck-style piles of money.)</p>
<p id="e5aO6e"><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf">Nintendo’s press release</a> makes it clear that Shiver’s port expertise is why it bought the studio. It specifically shouts out Shiver’s work on <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, notes the studio’s “high-level resources for porting and developing software titles,” and says that after acquisition “Shiver’s focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.”</p>

<p id="QLOnzE">But why would Nintendo be interested in acquiring a third-party, work-for-hire port specialist in the first place? There are many studios that specialize in this sort of thing, but they’re rarely acquired by platform-holders like Nintendo. When this does happen, it’s more likely to be a studio that makes shiny, enhanced remasters of older games — like Bluepoint Games, which was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22702363/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-sie-playstation-studios">acquired by Sony in 2021</a> — than an outfit that specializes in the less glamorous work of wrestling the latest releases onto less powerful hardware.</p>
<p id="FJRRAK">The most obvious conclusion is that, when it comes to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo is getting serious about reducing the gap in software libraries between its hybrid handheld and the current generation of home consoles and PCs. It wants AAA games to launch on its next console, and to that end, it has taken the unprecedented step of bringing porting expertise in-house, so it can offer this service to third-party publishers itself. It will probably find a willing market; Square Enix, for one, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155266/square-enix-multiplatform-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">has recently indicated</a> that it wants to bring its biggest games to as many platforms as it can, including Nintendo’s.</p>
<p id="10mKpl">Shiver is particularly experienced with Unreal Engine titles, and Nintendo has reportedly been demonstrating the Switch 2’s ability to run Unreal Engine 5 to its partners. And while the Switch 2 will certainly be less powerful than PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, reports indicate that it will be able to get quite close to them in terms of its visuals, in part thanks to use of Nvidia’s AI-powered DLSS upscaling technology.</p>
<p id="PKUBVn">There’s one last question. Why does Nintendo mention that, “even after it becomes part of the Nintendo group,” Shiver will continue to work porting games to “multiple platforms”? This is most likely a veiled reference to the Switch 2 — which Nintendo has not named, though recently <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151013/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announcement-teaser">admitted exists</a>. But it may also be that Nintendo is happy to let Shiver continue to work on other systems, partly so it can learn more about them and expand its porting expertise.</p>
<p id="jbr29t">Either way, it’s a fascinating development, and an indication that Nintendo is getting ready to step a little further out of its bubble with the Switch 2, and reintegrate with the rest of the game industry. </p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/job-creation-and-investment/amazon-games-expands-global-footprint-with-new-development-studio-in-romania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new official blog</a>, Amazon Games has announced it is opening a development studio in Bucharest, Romania, which marks its first expansion into Europe. </p>



<p>Previously, Amazon Games already had studios in Montreal, San Diego, Orange County, and Seattle. </p>



<p>VP of Amazon Games Christoph Hartmann said the Bucharest studio was a “natural next step for us as we tackle our broad portfolio.” The new dev studio will support Amazon Games’ portfolio “now and in the future.”</p>



<p>Cristian Pana, known for their prior work as Managing Director at Ubisoft Bucharest, will lead the Amazon Games Bucharest studio. Pana’s experience extends to titles like Far Cry and The Division. Today, Pana said that Amazon Games “is actively building across an exciting roadmap.”</p>



<p>The new studio in Europe follows Amazon Games layoffs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-is-laying-off-more-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in November 2023</a>. New studios are always welcome as the industry faces consistent layoffs. Just yesterday, Larian also announced it is opening a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-opening-new-studio-in-warsaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new studio in Warsaw</a>.</p>



<p>Amazon Games’ new Bucharest studio will likely support titles such as the anticipated Tomb Raider project and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-announces-lord-of-the-rings-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lord of the Rings MMO</a>. </p>



<p>Last year, Hartmann said that “bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team.” They added that the team plans to “do justice to the expansive Middle-earth universe.”</p>



<p>Today’s blog also mentioned “unannounced projects from our San Diego and Montreal studios.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/macabre-is-co-op-horror-with-serious-scare-potential<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Australia is already notoriously riddled with creatures that can kill you, from the snakes and spiders that can surprise you in the shower to the sharks and stingrays that circle our shores. Still, that hasn’t stopped developer Weforge Studio from drafting in a malevolent monster from another dimension and inserting it at the very top of the Aussie food chain in Macabre, a co-op ‘stealth extraction horror’ adventure that aims to fuse the bowel-loosening cat and mouse thrills of Alien: Isolation with the gadget-based teamwork of Phasmophobia. After a brief hands-on with a very early build of the game, I can attest to the prowling predator’s stalking prowess since I didn’t actually get a good look at the beast until it was suddenly dragging me through the snow-capped forest setting and knitting a sickening scarf out of my entrails.  </p><p>“To start with you are very helpless, and this thing’s going to terrorise you and tear you apart,” says creative director Jay Topping. “It's not like this dumb meandering thing, the way that it interacts with the player is that at first it's cautious, then it gets closer and [once] you're out on your own it's gonna start [picking you off].”  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The core gameplay loop of Macabre, which in its current pre-Alpha form takes place in and around an alpine lodge setting inspired by Australia’s Snowy Mountains region, sees up to four players investigating a mysterious rift in time and completing objectives provided by an exceedingly Australian guide named Banjo. In order to survive, players must scavenge for materials like batteries, electrical tape and old mobile phones to craft makeshift gadgets that both detect and distract the interdimensional assailant that hunts them from the shadows. </p><p>The map itself is marked with ominous trails of blood and shadows that appear to be either cast by the branches of the surrounding snowgum trees or the spindly limbs of a quadrupedal murder beast depending on how much you trust your fluctuating paranoia levels. Meanwhile, the map layout is randomised each time you enter it, further heightening the sense of panic and disorientation as you try to evade a deadly killer that silently studies and gradually learns to anticipate your behaviour. Yet although it’s effectively four against one, it’s worth highlighting that Macabre is not an asymmetrical horror experience like Dead by Daylight, and its monsters are solely AI-driven.</p><p>“When you play games like [Dead by Daylight], I think you lose a bit of the mystery and magic that comes with an AI-controlled monster,” says Topping. </p><p>“Player-controlled stalkers learn popular strategies from other players that make it repetitive, but they also mess around and do stupid shit, which really ruins the immersion. So the biggest inspiration [for Macabre’s monster] is Alien: Isolation where it's constantly adapting and changing. You can't just hide in the same closets or cabinets, eventually it's going to figure out that you've hidden that same cabinet three times [in a row], and it’s going to come and kill you.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Macabre Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While its core development team is based in Sydney and its initial map is inspired by Australian terrain, Weforge Studio’s plan for Macabre’s roster of deadly destinations is to expand beyond its southern hemisphere starting point. </p><p>“These rifts are kind of like portals, bubbles of time, that have popped up all over the place and they’re interconnected,” says Topping. “So while [Macabre] starts in Australia, it can kind of go anywhere including [destinations] beyond our own dimension.”  </p><p>The key is that each map will have to offer its own gameplay point of difference beyond mere texture swaps in order to consistently evolve the experience. One example given by Topping is the remote Australian outback town of Coober Pedy, an arid, desert area once featured in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome where residents build their homes in caves bored into the sandstone hillsides, which would serve as an ideal subterranean setting for a highly claustrophobic form of terror. Another potential Macabre map would be one located in China’s Kowloon Walled City, a densely populated slum that would bring a greater sense of vertical scale to the stealth horror. </p><p>“Kowloon Walled City would offer a great [visual] contrast of really dark areas and really bright neon-lit areas,” says Topping. “But its twisting corridors would also allow us to have a creature that runs around above you, below you, and in the walls.”</p><p>“It would be terrifying.”</p><p>The monster itself will apparently adjust its form and behaviour to suit each location, meaning that the unnatural enemy you encounter in the Australian Snowy Mountains won’t resemble the beast you encounter in say, a Mayan temple in a South American rainforest. In fact Topping compares it to the alien from John Carpenter’s The Thing or Pennywise from Stephen King’s It in the way it adapts to each environment. According to Topping, its ability set will also randomise along with the map elements each time you start the game, and that will determine which gadgets from your expanding list of blueprints you’ll need to craft.</p><p>“You’re not just dealing with the same thing every time,” explains Topping. “In each map there are different artifacts to find, and the combination of artifacts that are in there unlocks the abilities for that specific monster. You might go in and it will be moving super quietly and it’s invisible for most of the time, then [you’ll] need to [craft] this tool, this tool, and this tool [in order to combat it].”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ultimately, we’re not just trying to create one game; we’re trying to create a universe.</p></div><p>However, the interdimensional apex predator isn’t necessarily the only monster that players will have to contend with, as Weforge Studio is currently brainstorming ways for players to betray other players, potentially by steering them into the claws of the beast and then pilfering the loot off their freshly dispatched corpses.</p><p>“[In a way] that sounds like a good idea, but [the risk] is that you get into a realm where everyone is going to kill each other, and so why would they ever trust each other?” says Topping. “I think the feeling that we want to create is something like [social deception survival game] Dread Hunger where everyone works together, but in the back of their mind they're kind of like… <em>are</em> we working together?”</p><p>“Our end goal is to create the feeling of… you've got the main monster and then you've also maybe got all these other little monsters around you [in the form of your fellow players], and you can’t ever be completely sure if you should trust what everyone else is saying.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Exactly why the rifts have appeared and exactly what sort of dark forces are behind them is a mystery at this point, and at this stage Weforge Studio is keeping mum about the actual ‘extraction’ part of the experience – it’s not clear whether the goal is to gather resources and safely extract yourself from the area, or eventually somehow trap the monster and extract it along with you. However, what is clear is that Topping and his team have no shortage of ambition as far as the Macabre experience goes, and have apparently got a lengthy narrative backbone constructed that extends beyond just one game.  </p><p>“Ultimately, we’re not just trying to create one game; we’re trying to create a universe, like a Tolkien universe,” explains Topping. “Maybe [Macabre] is like The Hobbit and we’ll [eventually] get to The Lord of the Rings, you know? It would be so cool to build out a world around this so that it doesn’t just end at this game. There’s so much more that we want to discover.”</p><p>Weforge Studio has just launched a crowdfunding campaign to support the development of Macabre, which is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weforge/macabre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now live on Kickstarter</a>. But it’s not just financial support that the team is seeking, but the feedback from fans to help shape the scope and design of the Macabre experience. </p><p>“The idea with the Kickstarter is that we want to get community involvement,” says Topping.  “And I think we also want to do that during Early Access as well. Because ultimately, we can make a game for ourselves but [there’s no point] if no one's there to play it.”</p><p>“So we want to hear what people want to see. We've set the parameters, the [template] of these [maps that] you can play in. Where do you want to go?” </p><p>Even in its early state there’s a lot to like about Macabre and it’s strong potential for serious scares, and I’m certainly keen to see how it – like its main monster – continues to shapeshift and surprise as it progresses deeper into development. </p><p><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a senior video editor at IGN AU.

We need to deliver on expectations from developers and gamers and continue to propel future technology in gaming, so we took a step back to ensure we are set up to continue bringing the best gaming experiences to the community.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In a separate <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-important-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a>, then Head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed some games had been canceled as part of a "re-evaluation of how we operate", but failed to name them. "We looked at our studios and our portfolio, evaluating projects in various stages of development, and have decided that some of those projects will not move forward," Hulst said.</p><p>"I want to be clear that the decision to stop work on these projects is not a reflection on the talent or passion of team members.

Sometimes, a project is started with the best intentions before shifts within the market or industry result in a change of plan."</p><p>The Sony cuts come during one of the most difficult periods the game industry has ever faced, with mass layoffs throughout 2023 and continuing into 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/do-helldivers-2-players-just-prefer-to-fight-bugs-than-bots-it-certainly-looks-like-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>’s explosive launch on PC and PlayStation 5, players have had two alien factions to battle against: the terrifying robot Automatons and the brutal bug-like Terminids.</p><p>One ongoing theme coursing through the wonderful metanarrative that is Helldivers 2’s Galactic War is that the wider player base enjoys playing against the bugs more than the bots. This debate surfaces whenever a Major Order — Helldivers 2’s time-limited, community-wide missions - revolves around battling on Automaton planets. And almost every time, try as it might, the hardcore Helldivers 2 community that fusses over the success of the Galactic War can’t quite wrestle the majority of players over to the Western Front.</p><p>It’s happening again now, after Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead granted a bonus to planet liberation, but only if training facilities on Automaton planets (Vernen Wells) liberated in the prior Major Order remain under Super Earth control.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/helldivers-2-20240521115123-1716290573988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The problem is, most Helldivers 2 players are perfectly happy playing on bug planets, putting Vernen Wells, and thus the bonus liberation, at risk. Players have a number of theories why this sort of thing happens. The lack of in-game communication is certainly a valid suggestion. Helldivers 2 itself does not flag to players that Vernen Wells is a particularly important planet for players to focus on right now, so most won’t be aware it's in need of attention. Players have called on Arrowhead to add more in-game communication to help drive the wider player-base to Major Order-focused planets, rather than rely on social media posts and the likes of Discord and Reddit.</p><p>But, as many Helldivers 2 players have also suggested, the simple truth is many players prefer fighting against the bugs. The Terminids are, after all, the alien faction that realizes the Starship Troopers fantasy Helldivers 2 so heavily leans upon. And bugs are just a lot more squishy than their metal clad counterparts. On the harder difficulties, all Helldivers 2 missions can be nightmarish. But the Terminids are thought of as being more easy going than the Automatons.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/helldivers-2-20240521115446-1716290745979.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Most active Helldivers 2 players are fighting in Terminid-controlled systems.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Then there’s Automaton fatigue. The bots were the recent focus of a Major Order, so asking players to keep on top of bot planets when they might fancy a change is a tall order. In short, there’s no single reason at play for the Helldivers 2 community’s clear preference for Terminids, but the overriding sense is bugs are just more fun.</p><p>So, what’s to be done? Some Helldivers 2 players are now calling on Arrowhead to make fighting against the bots more rewarding by dishing out bonuses of some kind. There are also suggestions that planet liberation should be tweaked to reflect the number of players fighting in a system at any given moment. Arrowhead, fresh from the all-encompassing PSN debacle it is now trying to move on from, has said it will take its time to focus on game balance, among other things. Perhaps some user interface tweaks are also in order.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/helldivers-2-20240521115458-1716290984428.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Automaton-controlled systems tend to have fewer players, no matter the Major Order.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I think it's time to admit Automatons need a carrot dangled above them for players to touch the Western Front," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cwmaph/i_think_its_time_to_admit_automatons_need_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor CouldBeBetterTBH suggested</a>. "We just got a galaxy-wide buff not even two days ago and we're already going to lose part of it in 13 hours because no one likes the bots. 90k Divers online and 60k are on Terminid worlds.</p><p>"What else can we do at this point besides cheat the game-rules and add some kind of Medal/Sample multiplier effect onto Automaton planets? Nobody wants to play against the Bots, we are always the minority of the playerbase and keep failing all of our Orders and keep losing planets because nobody wants to touch our worlds with a 100-mile long pole.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Nobody wants to play against the Bots...</p></div><p>"Something needs to draw players onto this side of the Galactic Map or else we're never going to make any progress in the West unless Joel keeps tweaking the numbers and throwing pity wins at us every single time the Automatons become a focus or even a part of a Major Order."</p><p>Whatever your preference, Helldivers 2 is a smash hit, becoming Sony’s fastest-ever selling PlayStation game. It shifted an astonishing 12 million copies in just 12 weeks after going on sale, and has continued to push hard with its live service elements.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-pricey-pc-ports-now-available-on-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously made their way</a> to PC via the Epic Games Store, and now it’s Steam’s turn. Square Enix announced plans to dump a bucketload of intertwining lore on Steam, with three separate titles and a comprehensive bundle launching on June 13, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Titles on the way to Steam include <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> and <em>Kingdom Hearts III + ReMind </em>DLC. All of those compilations can also be snagged together in the <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece </em>bundle, which comes in way above the legal limit of <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>content.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">If you’re new to <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, or if you understandably just need a refresher on what these individual releases include, here’s a breakdown. Naturally, you’ll want to start at the beginning with:</p> <h2 id="h-kingdom-hearts-hd-1-5-2-5-remix" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">The saga starts here, with four games and two collections of remastered HD cutscenes. The games are <em>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix,</em> and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX. When you’re ready to sit back with some popcorn and a story-tracking notebook by your side, you can watch more cinematics in <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days </em>and <em>Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded</em>.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">A pair of games and an HD movie bridge the gap between the first collection and <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>. This release packs <em>Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD </em>with <em>Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-</em>, which takes players directly into the third entry. For an even deeper dive into the timeline and more info on the Foretellers, you’ll need to check out the included <em>KINGDOM HEARTS χ Back Cover </em>movie.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Kingdom Hearts III + ReMind</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The final piece of the puzzle (for now) is contained here. In addition to the main <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> game, this one comes with the <em>ReMind </em>DLC that followed, introducing new features, some challenging boss fights, and more.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="false">Amazingly, the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>series has been kicking around crossovers that previously seemed improbable for over 20 years. In that time it’s established a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/full-kingdom-hearts-timeline-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprawling saga</a> of its own, and more people getting a chance to experience it all is definitely a good thing. Just don’t let any negative word of mouth sour you on Goofy and Donald. They’re your FRIENDS and you need to trust them to make good decisions, okay?</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Once you’ve reached roughly the halfway point of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/">Anima weapon</a> grind in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you’ll find yourself needing stacks of Umbrite and Crystal Sand. These items are necessary to complete “A Dream Fulfilled”, turning your weapon from Hyperconductive to Reconditioned.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">The Umbrite and Crystal Sand will eventually be combined to create 180 Treated Crystal Sand. To make this, you’ll need roughly 60 of each initial item, and for the most part, they’re not easy to get your hands on. However, there are some ways to make this easier on yourself, so let’s look at how to get Umbrite and Crystal Sand.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-umbrite-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Umbrite in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">There is only one way to get Umbrite in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> – through exchanging Tomestones of Poetics with Hismena in Idyllshire (X:5.7, Y:5.2). Umbrite costs 75 Poetics each, and like I said, you’re going to need 60 of them. With this in mind, and considering the Poetics cap of 2,000 at any time, you’re going to need to farm for Poetics.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-the-best-way-to-get-poetics" data-injectable="false"><strong>The best way to get Poetics</strong></h3> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">There are a lot of methods for obtaining Poetics in FFXIV, but some are more lucrative than others. If you’re hoping to stock up the full 4,500 you need in order to complete your Umbrite collection, you’re going to need to know which duties are worth running and which aren’t.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="62" data-injectable="false">By far the most lucrative method is by running Duty Roulettes:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">These Poetics are awarded on top of the regular number of Poetics awarded for running whichever duty you receive as part of a roulette. For instance, if you receive The Orbonne Monastery as your Alliance Raid Roullete, you’ll receive 120 for doing it as part of the Roulette and 100 for completing the duty itself.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">Speaking of Alliance Raids, all of them except those added in the current expansion will reward 100 Poetics per clear. As well as this, if you complete any duty synced with another player who is new to it, you’ll get a bonus of 50 Poetics.</p>
 <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">Poetics are also rewarded in various amounts for other things, such as The Hunt, Treasure Hunt, Deep Dungeons, or Field content such as Bozja and Zadnor.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-crystal-sand-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Crystal Sand in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Crystal Sand is undoubtedly the hardest of these two items to get. In order to build your hoard of Crystal Sand, you’ll need to exchange certain items with Ulan in Idyllshire (X:6.4, Y4.7), but none of these items (or groups of items) is particularly easy to get. At the very least, you’re going to be spending a lot of Gil on the Marketboard to get the items you need.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">In my three successful Anima grinds, I’ve tried multiple different ways to get Crystal Sand. I’ve attempted to use my Crafters’ and Gatherers’ Scrips to get Blue Tokens to hand in, but you’ll need at least 3,750 White Scrips in order to complete this step that way. Which is certainly doable, but it’s not particularly quick.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a shortcut to this step, and you have the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-gil-without-crafting-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">spare Gil</a> (I’d recommend approximately 100,000 Gil to be safe) and some spare time on your hands, the best way I’ve found to get this step done is through the level 50 Extreme Trial drop items:</p> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Group 1</strong></td><td>1 Inferno Horn, 1 Crag Heart, and 1 Diamond Tear</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Group 2</strong></td><td>1 Vortex Feather, 1 Barb of the Whorl, and 1 Large Levin Orb</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">These can be purchased on the Marketboard for varying prices, but they’re always available, especially if you’re open to world-hopping in order to find a bargain. If you don’t want to purchase them, you can also steamroller the Trials themselves very quickly if you unsync them using a level 90 Job. You’ll need 30 of each item in a group, but at under a minute per clear, you’ll need a maximum of 90 minutes to get everything you need.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">Just in case you want to mix things up, here’s the full list of things you can trade for Crystal Sand:</p> <figure data-found-rows="12" data-current-count="884" data-injectable="false"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Exchangeable item(s)</strong></td><td><strong>How to get</strong></td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Crafters’ Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Crafters’ Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Gatherers’ Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Gatherers’ Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>1 Garlond Steel<br>1 Celestine<br>1 High Allagan Chimera Leather</td><td>– Crafted (Blacksmith, Goldsmith and Leatherworker respectively)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Amber-encased Vilekin</td><td>Heavensward Levequests</td></tr><tr><td>3 Battlecraft Demimateria I<br>2 Battlecraft Demimateria II<br>3 Fieldcraft Demimateria I<br>2 Fieldcraft Demimateria II</td><td>– Desynthesis<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Moonstone</td><td>– Deliverance (Ixali daily quest)<br>– 4,000 GC Seals each (20,000 total)<br>– Timeworn Goatskin Map<br>– Timeworn Leather Map<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Inferno Horn<br>1 Crag Heart<br>1 Diamond Tear</td><td>– Level 50 Extreme Trial drops (Bowl of Embers, Navel, Akh Afah Amphitheatre)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Vortex Feather<br>1 Barb of the Whorl<br>1 Large Levin Orb</td><td>– Level 50 Extreme Trials drops (Howling Eye, Whorleater, Striking Tree)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Superior Enchanted Ink<br>5 Thavnairian Mist</td><td>25 Tomestones of Poetics each (125 total)<br>20 Tomestones of Poetics each (100 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Allagan Catalyst</td><td>– The Labyrinth of the Ancients<br>– Syrcus Tower</td></tr><tr><td>1 Unidentifiable Bone<br>1 Unidentifiable Shell<br>1 Unidentifiable Ore<br>1 Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>Any of the methods used in the “Coming into It’s Own” quest</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

			<p>It’s always sad to see great games receding back into the mists of time, whether they’re all-time greats trapped on defunct consoles and operating systems, or smaller indie titles under the sheer weight of modern game releases. At least some of these games are given the opportunity to leap back to the forefront and relevance, and thankfully it means that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is back to be enjoyed by a brand new generation.</p>

<p>Through the Nintendo Switch’s life, Nintendo has been far from consistent in how it’s treated the GameCube. After largely ignoring it for the first few years, there’s then been emulator-based ports, enhanced HD ports, and full remakes. Thankfully, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is getting the full works, a ground-up rebuild of the game in a new engine, making one of, if not the best entry in this beloved series available to play on the latest Nintendo hardware.</p>


<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door typifies the kind of individuality that the earlier games in the series were able to cultivate. Sure, there’ Goombas, Koopas and Toads all over the shop, but they’re joined by new and original characters and creatures throughout. From the small secretive critters known as Punies, to the X-nauts, the Three Shadows and beyond, they stand out when compared to later games –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/15/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review/">The Origami King</a>, for example, felt like it was almost entirely Toads wearing different hats. Having this breadth of characters also helps to feed into a script that’s wonderfully humorous and quirky throughout.</p>


<p>There’s also a darker twist to the world you’re exploring. The Thousand-Year Door opens with Paper Mario summoned to Rogueport, a town which is as rough as you could imagine for a Mario game, from the graffiti and background gang encounters, to the fact that there’s a literal hanging frame right in the middle of the town square! There’s massive shifts in the visual design of the places you visit, when comparing Rogueport to the charming village of Petalburg, and then the utterly distinctive Boggly Woods with its colourful floor pattern contrasting with black tree trunks, white foliage and grey creatures.</p>
<p>The whole game has been remade with a crafted appearance that’s more in keeping with the last few entries in the series. You can see card edges and folds in so many objects and through the scenery, while Mario and other characters have the appearance of thick card stock –&nbsp;Card Mario isn’t quite as catchy, though –&nbsp;and the battle scene in particular now feels like a pop-up diorama, still with the theatre curtains and audience members watching on.</p>

<p>The one jarring element of this makeover for me remains the shiny and reflective floor, which doesn’t feel in keeping with the rest of the art style –&nbsp;it makes sense for a metal floor, sure, but less so for grass or woods. It’s the one effect that I’d like to have been used more sparingly, but it’s a small quibble when we have the loveliness of dynamic lights, or the floor in Boggly Woods going from a static colour gradient to a colour-shifting iridescence.</p>
<p>Another important factor for a Paper Mario game is the combat, and here we get to go back to the good old turn-based with timed actions from the original. This is an RPG of small numbers, with health measured in the tens, damage dealt in the single digits, and with one partner character at a time. It’s a refreshing simplification after the more puzzle-like combat of the most recent game, Paper Mario: The Original King, or the cards system from the 2010s. Thanks to the widescreen view, the UI has been made less cluttered, and all of the attack button timings have refreshed graphical elements.</p>

<p>There’s also a relatively minimalist character progression system. Every 100 Star Points earned in battle lets you level up and increase health points, flower points (for special attacks), or badge points. It’s the latter one that is generally more important to get, as everything beyond your core abilities and items you earn (like better boots for jumping) depends on applying badges.</p>
<p>The more badge points you have, the more badges you can apply, which will either buff you or your allies in combat, add new attacks… or make your attacks sounds different. You’ll want to try and explore every nook and cranny to find Star Pieces, which is one way that you can buy more badges, find chests that can net you extra badges, or just use regular coins at certain shops.</p>

<p>Really the main foible of The Thousand-Year Door was and is the amount of backtracking that can be involved in some areas and chapters. You can feel it seeping into the game fairly early on as you go hither and tither, and it’s maybe made a little more noticeable by how broken up some areas are into separate rooms and through various pipes. This remakes quality of life improvements feel more subtle than certain other remasters, but there are still plenty of good improvements. The Warp Pipe room is overhauled to make switching regions quicker and easier to access, you can nudge Goombella for advice with a single button press, switch partner characters without dipping into menus, and there’s some more helper characters sprinkled through the world for those that need them.</p>
