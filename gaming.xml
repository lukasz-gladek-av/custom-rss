			<p>Smite 2 has been in Alpha for a little while now, with new Gods being added pretty consistently to the game. At the moment, there are only two modes available, with players having the choice between playing Arena or Conquest. However, the MOBA is now set to enter Open Beta, allowing any who are interested to start playing it as of January 14. So, for those interested, you won't have long to wait.&nbsp; The game has been progressing at a steady rate, with most of the team at Hi-Rez swapping working on Smite to Smite 2. For those who haven't had access to Smite 2, there was a confirmed skeleton crew to be working on Smite just for small updates.</p>
<p>However, as they rearranged the team working on Smite, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">led to layoffs</a> at the company that was not disclosed in the statement that Stewart Chisam wrote, but that the changes were "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was originally released in 2014, with its successor announced 12 months ago. This came after Hi-Rez celebrated 10 years of Smite, and now they are working on a new and improved that comes with multiple new Gods and plans to keep the game in action late into the 2030s.</p>
<p>At the moment, those who have wanted to play Smite 2 will have had to get a key for the Alpha via Smite 2 streams or purchase <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Founder's Pack on Steam</a>, which would give them extra bonuses in addition to access to the game as it develops.</p>
<p>With the release of the Free to Play Open Beta, it means that all of the pre-existing players and those who are just joining will get access to a ton of new content that will become available during this period specifically.</p>
<p>This includes five new Gods that will be added to the game, including Aladdin. Along with the variety of Gods in the game, there will also be three new game modes to jump into. These are Joust, Duel, and Assault, offering plenty of options for players who don't get on with the Conquest and Arena game modes that were already in the game. You can check out the Aladdin gameplay in the video below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>studio Stonemaier Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>family. As you've probably already guessed, the game expands the card-based engine-building gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>into the world of marine life.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which follows on from&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow">dragon-based successor&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em></a>, has you playing as a marine researcher who must observe aquatic life over three zones: the Sunlight Zone, the Twilight Zone, and the Midnight Zone.</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>'s dive sites will help you with a key aspect of your research, from growing your fish collection to discovering new eggs and even hatching eggs to create schools of fish. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, you'll probably be familiar with the basic idea here, albeit with a marine twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=yFRfN_Xc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=n-viEVPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>takes the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>formula to new depths, as it were.</figcaption></figure><p>Players will compete with one another to assemble vast arrays of marine life, with the winner being the player that gains the most points. You can score points through "fish, eggs, young, schools, and achievements", according to Stonemaier.</p>

<p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>designer Elizabeth Hargrave says that while she knew fish were often requested by fans of her game, she "didn't feel like [she] had the bandwidth to do them justice", but that she's "absolutely delighted"&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will soon be out there in the world.</p>

<p>Hargrave goes on to say that she hopes&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>"will inspire people to connect with the marine world and conservation in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>has made people birders".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which also shows off the game's beautiful board and fish card artwork, right here.</p>




<p><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will support up to five players of ages 10 and up, and a game should take you somewhere between 45 and 60 minutes to complete, which is roughly in keeping with&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>'s duration.</p>

<p>Notably, the game will also offer a solo play mode created by Automa Factory, the studio that also worked on solo play modes for Stonemaier titles like&nbsp;<em>Scythe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tapestry</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>when it launches on January 22nd to <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/finspan/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buy direct from Stonemaier</a>, followed by a wider retail release in February.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a bold claim onstage at CES earlier this week when he was introducing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">next-generation RTX 50-series GPUs</a>. “The RTX 5070, 4090 performance at $549,” said Huang. It’s a claim that’s been echoed on YouTube, TikTok, and social media networks and has generated a debate over the RTX 50 series and DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation. </p><p>So, can a $549 RTX 5070 really deliver the same level of performance as a $1,5999 RTX 4090? The answer is yes and no, and it all comes down to a “fake frames” argument about DLSS Frame Generation that might not even be a big problem for a lot of PC gamers.</p><p>Nvidia’s big RTX 5070 claim is all based on its latest generation of DLSS. “Impossible without artificial intelligence,” admits Huang after promising that the RTX 5070 can deliver RTX 4090 levels of performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 has a new Multi Frame Generation technique</a> that can generate up to three additional frames per every traditionally rendered frame.</p><p>Some PC gamers have long argued that this technique, which Nvidia introduced originally with DLSS 3, is simply “fake frames” and not reflective of the true performance of GPUs that have been using rasterization for decades.</p><p>“Using neural rendering and DLSS 4 we can reach performance levels [on an RTX 5070] that were only possible with an RTX 4090,” explains Lars Weinand, a senior technical product manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “This does not mean that the RTX 5070 can beat an RTX 4090 in every single way and in every single configuration.”</p><p>When Nvidia says performance levels, it means frame rates: how many still images it can send to your screen that add up to a moving image — rather than whether that moving image looks the same quality. Nvidia has already shown what DLSS 4 is capable of in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, boosting frame rates from DLSS 3.5 at 142fps to 243fps — a big leap from the 27fps without DLSS enabled. </p><div><figcaption><em>The DLSS 4 boost to frame rates.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>“In games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Alan Wake 2,</em> you can match performance numbers [on an RTX 5070] using DLSS 4 compared to an RTX 4090 using only DLSS 3.5 Frame Generation,” says Weinand. “This is what the claim is based on, you see performance levels that were only before possible with an RTX 4090, but of course, that doesn’t mean that in every single configuration and graphics setting that you might pick that you will have the similar performance.”</p><p>As expected, you’re simply not going to see RTX 4090 levels of pure rasterization performance on an RTX 5070. It’s really all down to seeing a difference in games that support DLSS 4. As a result, Nvidia’s claim has reignited the “fake frames” debate. This all started when Nvidia first announced DLSS 3 Frame Generation, which works by using an algorithm to insert an additional frame after two successive images in order to smooth out movement in games and increase frame rates.</p><p>In DLSS 3, Nvidia generates a new image using Frame Generation every time a new image is rendered, allowing the GPU to use its full power to render regular frames and DLSS to utilize dedicated Tensor cores to boost frame rates and image quality.</p><p>With DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Nvidia is now able to generate up to three additional frames per every traditionally rendered frame. That means frame rates can be up to 8x more than traditional rendering. Nvidia has also switched to a new transformer model for DLSS 4, which it says will make its frame generation model 40 percent faster and use 30 percent less VRAM.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s still a lot to learn about DLSS 4, but during a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/jensen-says-dlss-4-predicts-the-future-to-increase-framerates-without-introducing-latency">Q&amp;A session at CES</a>, Huang said that DLSS 4 “predicts the future” rather than “interpolating the past.” That means the extra two frames that are generated by DLSS 4 won’t add a huge amount of latency to the experience.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080"><em>Digital Foundry</em>&nbsp;found</a>&nbsp;that DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has smoother frame times despite adding two additional frames compared to the existing Frame Generation. It also found that there is around an additional 6ms for the Multi Frame Generation on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">the RTX 5080</a>, on top of the existing Frame Generation found on the RTX 40 series.</p><p>“The latency is very small that we’re adding with Multi Frame Generation,” says Weinand. “With the GPU pacing that we’re doing, we make sure that frames are being displayed at a very even pace.”</p><p>Input latency, or the way a game feels, is very important in many games, and the results of DLSS 4 will depend on your input frame rate. DLSS 4 doesn’t appear to solve the issue of a 27fps game still feeling like slow once DLSS Super Resolution is involved, even if Multi Frame Generation can more than 8x the frame rate to 243fps. That’s been one of the main drawbacks of DLSS Frame Generation so far — that although a game can look visually smoother thanks to the additional frames, it still feels slower than if it were actually rendering at high frame rates. A lot of people might not even notice the input latency, but if you’re familiar with the feeling of dropping from 240fps to 60fps or even 30fps, then you probably will.</p><p>I think the “fake frames” debate really only matters when these technologies are impacting latency and image quality or the game still feels slow despite the extra generated frames. More games are starting to get full ray-tracing support to make them look dramatically different, but it’s difficult to play them without DLSS Frame Generation on even the best GPUs. There’s a tradeoff here where people might not mind “fake frames” if they’re getting far better visuals.</p><p>So much of modern gaming is already “fake,” and it has been for years. Rendering itself is all about the tricks, shortcuts, and optimizations that developers use to produce something that looks like reality. DLSS 4 gives developers yet another tool to achieve image quality, lighting effects, or gameplay that we wouldn’t have thought was possible until recently.</p><p>For years, we’ve been playing games on consoles that aren’t at native resolution, with developers using a variety of different rendering techniques to dynamically adjust resolution, image quality, and more. Nvidia is making it clear with DLSS 4 that the future of PC gaming will involve AI-powered rendering techniques, and it’s something both Sony and AMD are leaning into with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst">PlayStation partnership</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">AMD’s latest FSR 4 upscaling</a>. Some PC gamers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOItZa2oqVc">might not like</a> “fake frames,” but it’s clear they’re very much here to stay.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite is nothing short of sensational. It’s the world’s most popular battle royale game, and since 2024, it has become a titanic title of epic proportions, featuring many ‘smaller’ games within its ecosystem. There’s a racing game, a Guitar Hero-style game, and an infinite suite of UGC for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>On the subject of ‘players’, how many people play Fortnite? Is the Fortnite player count as strong as it was a couple of years ago? In this short guide, I’m diving into that very topic and answering the question.</p>



<p>Read on to find out how many people are playing Fortnite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-player-count-confirmed">Fortnite Player Count Confirmed</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, a whopping 1.81 million people were playing Fortnite</strong>, with a 24-hour peak of 2.45 million users. That number is typical for Fortnite, which remains one of the most-played games in the world, even almost a decade after it first hit the market. </p>



<p>On <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite.gg</a>, users can see exactly how many people play Fortnite and find out statistics such as gain percentage and average rates, plus player peaks – it’s very interesting stuff.</p>



<p>The site also lists various other stats, which I’ll cover now.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-played-fortnite-map">What is the Most Played Fortnite Map?</h3>



<p><strong>‘Battle Royale’ is the most-played Fortnite map</strong>, boasting an all-time peak of 6.53 million players.</p>



<h3 id="h-who-is-the-top-fortnite-creator">Who is the Top Fortnite Creator?</h3>



<p><strong>Epic is the top Fortnite creator</strong>, boasting control of some of the most popular maps ever made in the Fortnite world. Epic has accrued 959 billion minutes played. Behind Epic sits ‘bullseye’, with 25.6 billion minutes played.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-played-fortnite-genre">What is the Most Played Fortnite Genre?</h3>



<p><strong>Most players prefer PvP</strong> – there are 65,787 PvP maps in the Fortnite universe, and at the time of writing, 410,000 players were dedicating their time to PvP. </p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-all-time-highest-fortnite-player-count">What is the All-Time Highest Fortnite Player Count?</h3>



<p><strong>The most players ever in Fortnite at the same time was 14,343,880</strong>, and that number was recorded in December 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fortnite-dying">Is Fortnite Dying?</h2>



<p>It seems bizarre to suggest that Fortnite is dying when you look at how many people play the game, but here we are. There are always those who will oppose the game and suggest it’s ‘dead’ or ‘dying’, regardless of how many people play Fortnite. That’s just a fact of life.</p>



<p>The reality is, Fortnite is only becoming more powerful over time. It’s still the world’s most popular game, and it drives competitive and creative ecosystems like no other game ever made.</p>



<p>It’s not dying, and it probably won’t for many years to come.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Player Count – How Many People Play Marvel Rivals?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-%E2%80%93-how-many-people-play-marvel-rivals.1077144/</guid>

<p>Marvel Rivals is a showstopper of a game. It was released by NetEase on December 6, 2024, skyrocketing up the charts and becoming known as a powerhouse title that quickly pulled in more than 20 million players – in just a few weeks. As we all know, time impacts the popularity of a game like nothing else, so what does the Marvel Rivals player count look like now?</p>



<p>I’ve taken a look at how many people play Marvel Rivals, breaking down the player data that we can see to determine the health of the game.</p>



<p>Is Marvel Rivals already dying, or is the player count soaring? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed">Marvel Rivals Player Count Confirmed</h2>



<p>It’s not possible to get accurate Marvel Rivals player count data from all the platforms it’s available on, but we can get a representative figure from Steam and simply extrapolate from there.</p>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, 231,346 people were playing Marvel Rivals on PC</strong>, and the 24-hour peak sat at 437,541 users. Amazingly, more users flooded Marvel Rivals in January than in December, with the game gaining momentum as 2025 kicked off.</p>



<p>This might only be data for PC gamers, but it’s a solid indication that the game is performing very strongly on all platforms, given that it’s free to play and highly accessible.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-already-dead">Is Marvel Rivals Already Dead?</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals has suffered slightly with some teething issues, particularly some concerns regarding network stability, unbalanced heroes, and of course, cheaters. However, none of these topics have been powerful enough to prevent the game from growing, such is proven by the Marvel Rivals player count.</p>



<p>This is a solid and substantial alternative to hero shooters like Overwatch, and it’s already proving to be a thorn in the side of those supporting Valve’s Deadlock, which is yet to be released. As there’s a fantastic roster of characters that gamers love and find familiar, the fanbase for the title was ready and waiting on the day the game was released.</p>



<p>If you haven’t played Marvel Rivals, you’re missing out. As the player count proves, it’s a success with gamers worldwide.</p>

We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on <em>Transformers</em> for their dedication and passion.</p><p>Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.</p><p>While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.</p><p>Thank you for your compassion and understanding.</p><p>—Splash Damage</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ceo-of-plaion-formerly-koch-media-to-step-down-after-31-years.1077084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Klemens Kundratitz, the CEO and co-founder of Plaion (formerly known as Koch Media), will step down from his role after 31 years and take an advisory role with parent company Embracer Group.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Kundratitz has decided that it's time to "take a step back and spend more time with his family", and so he's handing over the CEO reins to Phil Rogers, an exec who's "leading the creation of the new Middle-earth &amp; Friends operating unit".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Middle-earth &amp; Friends is one of the three companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">into which Embracer Group will be splitting</a>&nbsp;during this year, alongside tabletop division Asmodee and indie label Coffee Stain &amp; Friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=NU5JGk3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=EbZDFiuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Through its various divisions, Plaion has published a number of games, including&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Kundratitz, who co-founded Plaion as Koch Media alongside Franz Koch back in 1994, says he's "delighted" to be handing over CEO duties to Rogers, and that he believes Rogers will continue Plaion's "excellent momentum".</p>

<p>For his part, Rogers says he's "excited" to start building Middle-earth &amp; Friends as Plaion's new CEO, and that Kundratitz has built an "incredible legacy" over the course of his 31 years with the company.</p>

<p>Though you might not recognize Plaion's name, you'll probably know at least one of the publishing labels under its stewardship, namely Deep Silver, Ravenscourt, and Prime Matter.</p>

<p>Through Deep Silver, Plaion has published games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/payday-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Payday 3</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-island-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metro-exodus" rel="nofollow"><em>Metro Exodus</em></a>, while the Prime Matter label is responsible for the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a>&nbsp;</em>(whose developer Warhorse Studios is also a subsidiary of Plaion) and 2023's&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=1865tiQI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=gCCB_aF9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many pies in which Plaion has its fingers.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Kundratitz himself, while he's stepping back from CEO duties with Plaion, he's not leaving Embracer entirely. He'll now serve as a "strategic advisor" for the group, which, given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow">recent financial woes</a>, I'm sure will be appreciated.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Kundratitz's departure will have a material effect on Embracer or its companies from a public-facing perspective, but we'll have to wait and see whether anything changes as a result of this management shift. Stay tuned.</p>

Like the first beta test, these won’t require PS Plus or Game Pass Core subscriptions to play online, either. Capcom said its running the additional betas to give more players a chance to try the game who might have missed the first test back in November.</p><p>But while the publisher said it learned a lot from that weekend in terms of player feedback and complaints, don’t expect anything different this time around. “Please bear in mind that these improvements, including performance, game balance, weapon mechanics, known issues and more will not be reflected in the OBT 2 build,” the company stated this week. </p><p>Those improvements, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlined by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>director Yuya Tokuda in a previous video</a></span>, will eventually include monsters moving to new areas less frequently, and making “hitstop” more noticeable so smacking enemies with giant swords and axes feels more satisfying. The team announced several balance tweaks to weapons as well. It’s unclear why these couldn’t be added to the game for the new betas, which would no doubt have given Capcom even more time to gauge community feedback ahead of the game’s full release. That is, after all, what betas are supposed to be for.</p><p>Instead, fans will have to wait until February 28 to see the changes in action. At that point, anyone who participated in one of the betas will get their bonus rewards like a decorative in-game pendant and a starter item pack of meat, traps, and other monster hunting necessities.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next Pokemon Presents date has seemingly been leaked, and it comes from an unexpected source. </p>



<p>A keen-eyed <a href="https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1876988464878567879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">user on Twitter</a> spotted metadata from Niantic that hints at the next Pokemon Presents taking place on February 27, 2025. In the data it shows a title of “Pokemon Presents 2025 x GO Tour: Unova Timed Research”. </p>



<p>The leaked date shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since 2021, there has been a Pokemon Presents on February 27 every year to coincide with Pokemon Day. If we are looking at when each of the last four events were announced, they usually didn’t come until just days prior. That means fans shouldn’t expect an official announcement on the next Pokemon Presents until around February 20 or so. </p>







<p>As far as what to expect during the showcase, it’s clear based on the title that a new timed research event for Pokemon Go will be shown. Also, with Pokemon Legends Z-A scheduled to launch this year, it could be assumed that the game will be shown in some way.  Elsewhere, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket is likely to see a solid presence after it’s successful launch late last year. There’s also a good chance The Pokemon Company has a surprise or two up its sleeve in honor of the 29th Anniversary of Pokemon’s 1996 launch.</p>



<p>Whatever The Pokemon Company has in store for fans, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the broadcast.</p>



<p>What do you think we see during the Pokemon Presents on Pokemon Day 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

                <p>Next month, Capcom will bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to players just over seven years since the last mainline game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review-a-very-ice-ti/1900-6417288/" data-ref-id="1900-6417288">Monster Hunter: World</a>, debuted in 2018. There was an open beta for players in October, and now Capcom has announced that a second open beta in February. The news was accompanied by the following video, which features Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto using the create-a-character function to place himself in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWAYmEQKso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of content, the new beta will be very similar to the one from last year. Players will still be able to use the character creator, try out the story trial, and complete the Slay Doshaguma quest. However, this version of the demo will also include Gypceros, a monster from the previous games who was absent in the first demo.</p><p>According to Tsujimoto, characters created in the first beta can be carried over to the second beta and to the final version of the game as well. However, game progress will not be transferable. The second open beta will be held over two weekends on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It will also be cross-platform, and the beta is open to all players regardless of whether they have Game Pass or PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Players who take part in the new beta will get bonus in-game rewards including a charm for a weapon and an item pack. The second beta will take place from February 6 at at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET until February 9 at the same time. Then the beta will have another weekend preview on February 13-16, presumably during the same hours as the previous event.</p><p>Tsujimoto noted that the team has implemented changes based on feedback to the first beta test, which attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-begins-with-almost-500000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6527527/" data-ref-id="1100-6527527">almost 500,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. Unfortunately, those changes will not be in the next beta. Instead, Capcom will likely wait until the game's February 28 release date to implement those improvements.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer.1077036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In September of last year, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">announced</a>. The circles I frequent online were quite enthusiastic about this, despite me having never heard of the game. I mean, I didn't even own a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vita" rel="nofollow">PS Vita</a>, it seemed like a completely obscure title. Still, the excitement from my friends piqued my interest, so I had to see what <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was all about.</p>

<p>It seemed like a weird choice to revive a dormant IP exclusive to the PS Vita, but I'm glad I took the chance to review it. Turns out, <em>Freedom Wars </em><em>Remastered</em> is a quirky and competent take on the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a> </em>formula, and that makes for an addicting game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=BxiFgXLe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=2Nmk-fdF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I guess I'll take that as a compliment?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Freedom Wars Remastered,</em> a Decade After the Original</h2>

<p>As <em>Freedom Wars</em> is a remaster of a PS Vita title from 2014, you might expect it to look a bit dated visually. The smaller screen of a Vita means lower resolution, so obviously graphics aren't going to be on par with that of consoles.</p>

<p>Still, developer Dimps Corporation makes a commendable effort to revitalize <em>Freedom Wars</em> with this remaster. With upgraded textures and running a higher resolution, <em>Freedom Wars</em> <em>Remastered</em> looks very good considering its origins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AD2jGueH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=1iW1Ohiw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The squad's here!</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, it can run on 4k resolution. I couldn't find any way to tweak graphics on the PS5 version of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>, so I'll just have to take the developer's word for it. I presume PC versions will have more options to adjust visuals. At the very least, I can say <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> runs at 60 FPS, so it's a smooth ride.</p>

<p>Really, the only issue is some animations look a little janky, especially during dialogue. There's a lot of talking in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered, </em>and facial animations are super rudimentary. It's nothing that'll detract from the experience; in fact, it's usually the only <em>visual </em>reminder that this was once a PS Vita game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=nxl8UtQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=8fGmfn3e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's satisfying to drag down a big ol' monster!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For the Cause in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>To put it simply, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> takes the <em>Monster Hunter</em> formula and gives it a gratifying hook (as if <em>Monster Hunter </em>wasn't already addicting). Not only are you acquiring new materials to upgrade equipment, but you also have a million-year prison sentence. As a sinner, you're tasked with working off that sentence by taking on various operations.</p>

<p>Your player character's prison sentence literally looms over your head, and just about every action you do either contributes to or diminishes said sentence. Stand around in one place too long? The game will give you a few decades to think about your ungodly crime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5K79MwUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5slMXScb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just a drop in the bucket.</figcaption></figure><p>And so, that's where these operations come in. Completing various missions, ranging from extermination of "Abductors" (<em>Freedom Wars' </em>version of monsters), rescuing citizens, and donating valuable resources to the cause, all help diminish that prison term.</p>

<p>Watching the prison sentence deteriorate over the course of the campaign and into the endgame is a very satisfying feeling, even if it's an arbitrary number. It's a way to catalog your rank among other players and track your progress. Having this little way to measure your efforts encouraged me to do "just one more mission."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=viEelOT3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=35ppx2Ns 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We got Rathalos at home.</figcaption></figure><p>This progress is also tracked via online leaderboards. It's a multiplayer game with other sinners, and each sinner belongs to a Panopticon. Think of a Panopticon as your home base. You choose this at the beginning of the game when you're customizing your character, and each Panopticon represents a prefecture of Japan.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this will change once the public has hands on it, but the original version of <em>Freedom Wars</em> split Panopticons as cities around the globe. Though, as far as I know, the only choice now is Japan's prefectures, so I went with Hokkaido.</p>

<p>The leaderboard tallies your contribution both within the Panopticon and against other prefectures, so it's again, a very neat little measure to see how everyone's progressing and incentivizes some friendly competition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=PnRJ97GW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=3xdoBSgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, guns are the best option!</figcaption></figure><h2>On the Hunt in<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>It's in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s combat that many players will find some sort of familiarity with. I don't like to draw comparisons to other games if I can help it, but it's hard to ignore the fact that<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em> plays a great deal like <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>The whole routine of fighting giant monsters (Abductors), severing parts, upgrading your equipment from said parts, and going back into the fray is the general gameplay loop here. Though, on its own, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> is a competent action game, even if it's a bit light on game mechanics.</p>

<p>There are several different weapon types to choose from, each with its own skillset, as well as firearms. You can equip yourself with two different weapons at once, so that gives room for some versatility. You're also given several AI companions if you're playing solo, as well as your own customizable Accessory -- this is a robot companion that helps you out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=4jYnJyuJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=1BcP709u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once they're on the ground, it's time to lay on the hurt.</figcaption></figure><p>To top it all off, you have a thorn, which makes <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s gameplay quite enjoyable. By shooting a thorn onto a wall or enemy, you can launch yourself to that location and pull off some cool air attacks. It's especially useful against Abductors so you can sever parts that are higher up.</p>

<p>Thorns are super fun to use, launching yourself around gargantuan foes like you're from <em>Attack on Titan</em>. It adds just a bit of extra oomph to the gameplay, though the rest of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> could do with either new weapons, a few new attacks, or just something else to help it stand out.</p>

<p>Enemy variety, too, is just a bit repetitive. Most enemies come in the form of Abductors, and they increase in power as you progress through the campaign. The thing is, most of them follow the same template of being bipeds, quadrupeds, and the like, and they don't look or act all that different as time goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=PPPqQDfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=zdJCpUkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aries, one of the story's several key characters.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Story That Never Reaches Its Potential in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>My thoughts on <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story are conflicted. On one hand, I really like its premise and setting, but on the other, the way the story is told is not all that great. The setting is, you're in this resource war, as presumably the world's resources are sparse in that day and age.</p>

<p>As such, Sinners are required to gather resources. Regular civilians are kidnapped by rival Panopticons' Abductors, and Sinners have to go save them. Meanwhile, there are various factions working within and outside of your Panopticon with different agendas and motives, most of which remain vague throughout the duration.</p>

There are some post-game activities, but as I understand it, the story was supposed to continue in a sequel that never was. It leads to some mysteries that are never solved, which is a shame.</p>

<p><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> also presents its story in a sloppy way. The start of the game is front-loaded with a ton of dialogue, so it's super slow-going at first and really could do better with its pacing. On top of that, walking around your Panopticon to continue the story is pretty sluggish and doesn't make for exciting gameplay.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OD00IBWxM" rel="nofollow">a few enhancements</a> that returning players will enjoy. Apparently, upgrading weapons has become a more seamless experience. They've added subtle improvements to combat overall, and even a new difficulty mode. These are additions that I initially took for granted, but when I learned about how <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> changed for the better, I was very appreciative of these tweaks.</p>

<p>Despite some problems with <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story and the lack of depth in its gameplay, I still had a lot of fun with this title. Seeing your sentence diminish as time goes on is a gratifying feeling. Moreover, once it launches for players worldwide, I imagine the conflict amongst other Panopticons will lead to some exciting rivalries.</p>

<p>Who knows, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> might even lead to the long-awaited sequel. I'd absolutely love to see <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s formula expanded upon. More depth in its gameplay and a more developed story in a sequel would make it a strong rival to <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>The update will represent the first major free content drop since the game's launch back in September, and it's officially coming to all platforms simultaneously on January 23rd, so you'll have to split your time <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date" rel="nofollow">between this and&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em></a>.</p>

<p>New features you can look forward to in the Nightmares Unleashed update include improvements to the Key system, new minibosses to take down, and alternate Master Nightmare encounter patterns to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>New activities can also be found throughout&nbsp;<em>Ravenswatch</em>, including Blood Rituals, which allow you to get your hands on Keys by battling a new enemy and halting the ritual. Other new events include Locked Chests, for which you'll need Keys, and the Sacrificial Idol, which lets you give up health for damage.</p>

<p>New NPCs have also been added in the form of the Refugees, a small group of unfortunate souls who will ask for your help if they encounter you. Passtech says they either represent "a glimmer of hope in your journey, or a bad decision around the corner".</p>

            <p>The more I tell you about <a href="https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/">Stimulation Clicker</a>, the less funny it will be, so let's keep this brief. It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.</p><!--more-->
<p>Stimulation Clicker angles forward and backward through the history of the internet. On the one hand, it's a merciless piece of trolling that tramples all over nerve endings worn to the hilt by the web 3.0 era of hyper-velocity enshittification. On the other, it's a testament to the expressive power of HTML, a reminder of those glory days 20 years ago when every website was a wishing well full of elusive or hidden moving parts and connections, including digital will-o'-the-wisps called "pop ups" that, back then, were a source of wonder and curiosity. You'd even click on them, occasionally! Awwwwww. I miss the internet being good.</p>
<p>Thanks to reader jamhandy for spotting Stimulation Clicker and chucking it into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-26">the latest Maw liveblog</a>.

But Ronald appears to want to make a distinction, suggesting the goal of creating a handheld would be to use the company’s expertise gained over decades of making consoles, and bring that to a portable PC. “I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,” the VP said told <em>The Verge</em>, “because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console.”</p><p>The goal, it seems, is to bring the two together. Or, perhaps more frankly, to make Windows less of a pain in the ass to use on a small screen. It’s something Microsoft hasn’t traditionally been great at. Did you ever own a Windows-based cellphone? I did! Haha! It was so bad. Then remember Microsoft’s last big attempt, with Windows 7's abysmal attempt to become tile-based, compromising its entire UI for the desktops everyone was using it on for the sake of portable devices on which no one was?</p><p>With every tech firm under the sun attempting to ride the success of Valve’s Steam Deck device and launching their own handheld PCs, Microsoft clearly wants a slice of the pie, but perhaps knows that Windows 11 wouldn’t cut it, and that it’d never be able to show its face again if it used a Linux-based interface. That’s likely driving Donald’s declarations of bringing the simpler UX of an Xbox to a Windows-powered portable. However, he’s being coy, telling <em>The Verge</em> “we’ll have a lot more to share later this year.”</p><p>However, what he has to say just now sounds awfully familiar. “I think,” Donald says, “at the end of the day our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device.” Which is a refrain we’ve heard countless times across countless iterations of the operating system. Each major new release comes with a major new push to make Windows so great for gaming, and none ever catches on. (Remember when Windows Vista launched, trumpeting a feature that would score your PC’s hardware out of 10, and believed the industry would publish games with a matching score so you’d know if it worked? No? Exactly.) And yet, bizarrely, Windows has <em>always</em> been the default OS for PC gaming, inevitably working far better the less Microsoft has tried to get involved.</p><p>But, as Donald points out, the Xbox OS is sitting on top of a lot of Windows’ code, so it shouldn’t be a herculean task to bring its tiled world across to a handheld device. Obviously it needs to be reworked for a PC such that it never needs a cursor input or a taskbar to be clicked, and sure, the Xbox already manages this, but that’s largely thanks to all the ways it’s defiantly <em>not</em> behaving like a PC, with its incredibly limited settings and locked-down nature. “There’s fundamental interaction models that we’re working on,” says Donald, “to make sure that regardless of the operating system details, it feels very natively like a gaming-centric device and a gaming-centric experience.”</p><p>So, the real message here is, forget about a possible portable Xbox for now, we could well be seeing a portable PC that <em>feels </em>like an Xbox within the year.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Amidst several announcements of new handhelds powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Ryzen Z2 processor</a>, Microsoft also talked about its upcoming highly anticipated Xbox handheld at CES 2025.</p>
<p>The Verge was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss the subject with Jason Ronald</a>, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem at Microsoft. Ronald, who previously led the development of the Xbox One X and Xbox Series S|X console launches, promised that the Xbox handheld would offer users the best of console and PC put together.</p>
<p><em>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</em></p>
<p><em>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the Windows work that you have to do today.</em></p>
<p>The launch of the Xbox handheld isn't quite imminent, but Ronald teased that Microsoft would share a lot more later this year.</p>
<p>There have been rumors about Microsoft's handheld projects for years. Head of gaming Phil Spencer finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed it</a> with his recent comments but also said the handheld is still 'a few years' out. Putting two and two together, it sounds like late 2026 could be a likely release window. The new Xbox home console is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to debut in late 2026</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that the&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>Adventure Mode will be launching out of beta later this month.</p>

<p>In an update on Steam, Bay 12's Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando reveal that Adventure Mode will arrive on January 23rd, having been available as part of <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>' beta branch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4186734162819864096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">since April</a> last year.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware of Adventure Mode, it's effectively a roguelike-style RPG gameplay mode in which you can explore the worlds you've generated as part of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>' main colony management gameplay, taking on quests and discovering all manner of exciting things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=yKUTx2CM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=rEgyJLzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adventure Mode officially lands in&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>on January 23rd.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Adams and Orlando say that focus will shift "back to Fortress Mode very soon", they also promise that Adventure Mode's full release is "not the end" of development for the feature.</p>

<p>Rather, there will be "many updates" for both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode in future, and the two say there's "more to add" to the roguelike mode as well, so you'll be getting extra features in the months to come.</p>

<p>As well as the Adventure Mode release date announcement, a new&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>beta update has also arrived today. Beta 28 adds tons of new features including new graphics, changes to character creation, and tons of gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>If you want to read the beta update's full patch notes, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here via Steam</a>. It's well worth checking them out if you want to see some of the super-granular changes Kitfox and Bay 12 have made to the game's beta branch.</p>




<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, it's a colony management sim in which you must oversee a colony of dwarves attempting to survive in a hostile procedurally-generated world.</p>

<p>The game is well-known for its emergent gameplay; the procedural generation and multiple interlocking systems of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>often allow amusing things to happen, many of which will be unique to each player's playthrough.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>was released all the way back in 2006, but the version being updated today is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-steam-release-date-unleashes-chaos" rel="nofollow">the 2022 paid version</a>, which updates the game's presentation and makes various other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

If you’re among the new PlayStation VR2 owners, you might feel overwhelmed looking at the over 300 games that are compatible with it. Where should you start?</p><p>There are many gems available via PlayStation VR2, ranging from VR-exclusive games to regular games with immersive VR modes. We could sit here all day listing everything worth playing on the console, but for people who just want to see what Sony’s headset can do, these eight games will offer you some of the best experiences the system has to offer. </p></div></div><div><p>It is literally impossible to make a list of the best VR games without starting with <em>Beat Saber</em>. It is the <em>Wii Sports </em>of VR gaming; it’s easy to learn, hard to master, and is a perfect use of motion-controlled technology. Even those who normally don’t take to VR games can enjoy <em>Beat Saber</em>’s straightforward gameplay, and it’s a surprisingly good workout to boot. I mean, it’s dancing with swords, what’s not to like?</p><p>Alternatively, if you like the idea of <em>Beat Saber </em>but don’t have cash to spend now, <strong>Synth Riders offers a similar rhythm game experience</strong> and is included with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. So if you have Sony’s subscription service and need something to tide you over, be sure to give that game a look.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501"><em>Horizon Call Of The Mountain</em></a></span><em> </em>honestly feels like a PlayStation VR2 tech demo, but it’s still really fun to play. As the name suggests, this is more a mountain climbing simulator than a VR-ified version of Sony’s flagship <em>Horizon </em>franchise. However, mountain climbing works <em>very </em>well in VR, especially since you can take in all the beautiful AAA-quality sights and get those tingles in your feet when you look down. I’m deathly afraid of heights and still enjoyed my time with this one.</p><p>It’s not a game that’s worth the standalone price of $60, in my opinion. However, since many Sony PlayStation VR2 headsets currently include this game as a pack-in at no additional cost, you’d be silly to pass it by. I liked it a heck of a lot for free.</p></div><div><p>Look, I get it, not everyone is necessarily chomping at the bit to play racing games unless there are red turtle shells involved. Despite that, you really have to give <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> a try if you’re looking for an immersive VR experience. It’s exhilarating to feel yourself in the driver’s seat as you race at 100+ MPH, and the Dualsense controller makes for a great motion-controlled steering wheel with its haptic feedback.</p><p>There’s never been a better time to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486">Sony recently released a free VR2-compatible demo of the game called <em>My First Gran Turismo</em></a></span>. Even if you just play it for ten minutes for the sheer novelty, you’ll enjoy your time.</p></div><div><p><strong>Currently available with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</strong></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><em>Before Your Eyes</em></a></span><em> </em>is more of an interactive movie than a game, but it’s a journey well-worth taking. Controlled entirely with your eyes and head movements, <em>Before Your Eyes</em> is both a celebration of life and a somber reflection about how we move forward in the face of tragedy. All I’ll say is that I had to clean the tears off my headset’s lens after I was finished.</p><p>It’s a good experience worth its asking price, but if you can get it for free via PlayStation Plus, this is a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a></span><em> </em>is already an incredible audio and visual feast for the senses, so you’re doing yourself a disservice if you haven’t played this one in VR. Also, I mean…it’s <em>Tetris</em>. You know you like <em>Tetris</em>, I know you like <em>Tetris</em>, so trying to explain why <em>Tetris </em>is great is like trying to explain why sunrises are great. <br></p></div><div><p><strong>Currently available with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</strong></p><p><em>Synapse </em>asks the question “what’s the most fun thing someone can do in VR” and lands on the answer “do cool telekinesis stuff with one hand while you shoot bad guys with the other.” It’s an incredibly playful use of the technology, and it innovates with its motion controls beyond the usual point-and-shoot antics of other games. This one’s a roguelike too, so even if you have a rough time getting the hang of it, you’ll at least enter your next run stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Synapse </em>lacks a bit in content. That might make this one a tough sell for $34.99, but it’s a perfect grab for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers.</p></div><div><p><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>is one of the most replayable games ever made, so it was no surprise that 2023’s <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> would go down as one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">the year’s best games</a></span>. And now, thanks to a free downloadable update that reimagines the game in VR, you can experience this all-time classic horror adventure in a brand new way. The motion-controlled aiming made me recall fond memories of playing <em>Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition</em>, and parrying attacks with your knife is so, <em>so </em>satisfying in VR.</p><p>You will be regularly reminded that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> was not originally designed for a first-person perspective. Cutscenes will play out as they did in the original flat screen version of the game, and actions like melee attacks will occur in third person (which is probably for the better, just thinking about Leon’s roundhouse kick in first person makes me motion sick). Regardless, if you need a reason to dive back into the world of survival horror, this is it.</p></div><div><p>I typically don’t double-up on games in the same franchise on lists like this, but <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a></span> are both so uniquely good as VR experiences that it’d be an injustice to not include both. Especially in this case, because <em>Resident Evil Village </em>actually <em>was</em> designed with a first-person perspective in mind. Key cutscenes will play out in VR, the combat feels simultaneously scary and enthralling, and the interface looks surprisingly natural. I’ve actually never seriously played <em>Resident Evil Village </em>until I tried it in VR, and even people watching me playing asked if the game was VR exclusive. It’s that good!</p><p>I will say the VR mode isn’t a perfect conversion. For example, you can twist your head around during cutscenes and view character models floating around that the player clearly was never meant to see. Still, <em>Resident Evil Village </em>reigns as my favorite experience with the PlayStation VR2, and it’s an incredibly easy recommendation if you want a bonafide adventure in the virtual world. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-new-parkour-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has just released a new blog post detailing the parkour systems for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parkour has always been an integral system for every Assassin’s Creed title, and it seems to be a handy tool in Shadows. Parkour will be an excellent feature for exploration and a key tool for stealth and combat. Naoe is the parkour master, and she can quickly scale castles, leap across rooftops and surf the crowds in the streets of Kyoto thanks to her speed and agility. Check out how parkour works in Assassin’s Creed Shadows below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-parkour-inputs-for-assassin-s-creed-shadows-nbsp">New Parkour Inputs for Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upcoming game has changed specific inputs to add more mechanics. The crouch and dodge buttons have switched places to add the ability to go prone and let dodge mechanics lead directly to parkour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will see that dodge and parkour down mechanics have merged thanks to the new input mapping. The new mapping will also disable the stance switch so that you can use any stance when going down from a rooftop. Players will also see new moves with the dodge button, such as acrobatic dodges over railings, jumping out of windows, or new silent drop-downs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-parkour-moves-nbsp">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Parkour Moves&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-parkour-up">Parkour Up</h3>



<p>Players who have played previous Assassin’s Creed games will know that this mechanic lets players hold a button to scale any building or structure they want, and the same parkour system will make its way to Shadows, too. The mechanic works while running up walls, jumping across gaps and leaping into the void. Naoe is better at jumping further and reaching higher than Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery-roll-nbsp">Recovery Roll&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When jumping from a distance, players can use the Igan Recovery Roll by pressing the dodge/parkour down button, considerably softening the blow and reducing the noise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Parkour Up &amp; Recovery Roll" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down">Parkour Down</h3>



<p>Here’s where the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows parkour system comes into play. As dodge and parkour mechanics have blended, players can press dodge near a ledge to transition into a parkour down traversal. Naoe will have acrobatic descents, while Yasuke will have heavy drops. Parkour down will let you access the safest lowest point below your character and avoid the player needlessly jumping into the void.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Dodge to Drop Down" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZMKe8NZBTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-sprint-mechanics-nbsp">Sprint Mechanics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A new system unique to Naoe, the fastest assassin in the franchise, has been introduced. This mechanic allows players to trigger an extended dive roll over smaller objects such as fences, crates, rails, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows also includes two more systems: automated passovers and shoulder tackles. Automated Passovers allow the characters to jump over smaller objects acrobatically. On the other hand, automated shoulder tackle is exclusive to Yasuke, allowing him to bash through enemies or destructive objects while sprinting. If there are non-destructible objects, Yasuke will use automated passover, but it won’t be as clean as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Sprint Dodge to Escape" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0OssNa4eI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-grappling-mechanics">Grappling Mechanics</h2>



<p>Apart from sprinting and parkour, Assassin’s Creed Shadows players can also access a grappling hook. With this tool, players can perform vertical ascents and hook swings. Naoe can also scale unclimbable walls by wall running and using the grappling hook on a ledge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Wall Run to Grappling Hook" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obO-PMO1Tfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-advanced-parkour-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Advanced Parkour in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<h3 id="h-stance-dodges">Stance dodges</h3>



<p>There are three types of stances: standing, crouching, and prone, and each stance has its own way of dodging for Naoe. Yasuke can dodge directionally while standing and crouching; however, only Naoe can dodge directionally while prone. This prone dodge will allow her to move side-to-side, roll forward, or slide backwards.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-wall-run-eject">Wall Run Eject</h3>



<p>Thanks to her acrobatic skills, Naoe can run up any wall. The Wall Eject tool allows her to perform an incredible jump off the wall by pressing the parkour button at the top of the run. If her hands and feet are connected to a surface, Naoe can also use this move while climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down-backward-dodge-and-high-structure-safety-nbsp">Parkour Down Backward Dodge and High Structure Safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Parkour Down Backward Dodge is a new move that allows the character to move while their back is facing the edge. In this position, the player can tap the parkour down button without directional input to cause their character to perform a backward dodge, rolling over the edge and down on the ground with a “muffled landing.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Backward Drop Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Parkour Down High Structure Safety is a new system that provides safety for the character at heights where fall damage could occur. In this situation, using parkour-down transitions would cause the character to hold on to the edge and hang there. You must press an additional button to make the character drop-down or climb up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-unclimbable-surfaces">Unclimbable Surfaces</h2>



<p>Lastly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have surfaces that Yasuke and Naoe <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cannot climb</a> with the help of parkour, as they do not have any physical handholds to grab on. The associate game director, Simon, shared that this move is a big deal for them as they must be “more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways.” Additionally, this allows them to have “more control about where Naoe can go and where Yasuke can’t,” adding more contrast to the play style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the developers have assured that most Assassin’s Creed Shadows areas are “very much climbable,” and even more so with the grappling hook. Players must look for “valid entry points from time to time.”&nbsp;</p>
