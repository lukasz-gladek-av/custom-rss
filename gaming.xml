            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter has arrived, and portable power stations have become the hottest commodity on Amazon as people scramble to protect themselves from unexpected power outages. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> (1500W) ranks among the most popular options for backup power and this early Black Friday deal seems almost too good to be true: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/">has slashed the price from $839 down to $419, marking a historic 50% discount</a> that puts professional-grade emergency power within reach of anyone worried about keeping their home running during the next storm or grid failure. You’ll also get a<strong> free extension cable</strong> in the bundle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Silent Power That Puts Gas Generators to Shame</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 provides <strong>1500 watts of continuous AC power and has a surge capacity of 3000 watts</strong>. This gives you sufficient power to run refrigerators, space heaters, medical equipment and multiple devices at once. The increased output can handle power-hungry appliances that once needed larger and pricier units. The pure sine wave AC outlets deliver clean power, and protect sensitive electronics like computers and gaming consoles from damage. This is in contrast to cheaper generators which can produce “dirty” power that damages circuit boards.</p>



<p>The LiFePO4 battery technology distinguishes this power station from competitors that still rely on older lithium-ion chemistry: This battery keeps over 70% of its original capacity after 4000 full charge cycles, and <strong>provides a lifespan of more than 10 years with regular use</strong>. In comparison, traditional lithium-ion batteries lose significant capacity after just 500 to 800 cycles.</p>
<p>ChargeShield 2.0 technology offers smart charging that adjusts to your needs through the Jackery smartphone app: When you need backup power quickly during an outage, the emergency charging mode<strong> takes the unit from completely dead to 100% in just one hour</strong>. For daily use, it defaults to a more conservative 1.7-hour charging time, which helps extend battery life by reducing stress on the cells. The quiet charging mode <strong>lowers operational noise to below 30 decibels</strong>, which makes it practically silent for overnight use in bedrooms or RVs, where generator noise can be a problem.</p>



<p>The included <strong>16-foot extension cord</strong> addresses one of the main issues with solar charging by allowing flexible panel placement: You can set solar panels in direct sunlight while keeping the power station shaded or inside your vehicle, maximizing charging efficiency without exposing the unit to heat. This feature is especially helpful during camping trips when the best sun angle might be far from your setup.</p>
<p>With a <strong>response time of under 20 milliseconds</strong>, the UPS functionality makes this unit a seamless backup system for home offices and essential equipment. It sits between your wall outlet and devices, switching to battery power as soon as it detects a power failure. This quick transition keeps desktop computers running without rebooting, protects fish tank pumps during outages, and ensures security cameras continue working during power interruptions.</p>



<p>The port selection accommodates all charging needs, featuring t<strong>hree AC outlets, two USB-C ports each delivering 100 watts, one USB-A port, and one 12-volt DC car port</strong>. The dual 100-watt USB-C ports charge laptops and tablets quickly without needing bulky power adapters, reducing cable clutter in your emergency kit or camping gear. The front-facing port layout simplifies connections with clear labels and LED indicators showing active outputs.</p>
<p>Despite having a capacity of 1070 watt-hours, <strong>the compact design weighs just 23.8 pounds</strong>. This makes it 18% smaller and 10% lighter than competing units with similar specs. A foldable handle on top ensures easy one-handed carrying, distributing weight evenly while moving it between rooms or loading it into vehicles. It measures 12.9 by 8.8 by 9.7 inches, making it easy to slide under seats or fit in closets without taking up too much space.</p>
<p>At $419 instead of the usual $839, this deal cuts the price in half for a power station that often comes with a high price tag. The package includes the power station, AC charging cable, extension cord, and travel case, and provides everything needed to start using it right away.</p>

Some players use all four at the same time, while others only connect one on each side. Since they are removable, you have that choice.</p><p>The paddles are the main draw for a lot of players, but the Elite Series 2 also has customizable sticks and directional pads. It comes with six swappable stick caps for the higher-quality metal analog sticks. You can adjust the tension on both sticks with the included tool. It's worth noting these are not Hall Effect sticks, so just like with the Xbox Wireless Controller, stick drift is a possibility. I've never had any issues with my Elite Series 2, but it can happen.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 has a unique, circular 8-way D-pad designed for quick movements. It can take some time to get used to it, but you can swap it out for a conventional 4-way D-pad. In addition to the swappable components, the Elite Series 2 has switches on the back to lock the triggers (RT and LT) to three different stopping points.</p><p>You can create three different control profiles using the Xbox Accessories App. Control layouts save to the controller and can be cycled through on the fly. Along with remapping the paddles and other controls, you can adjust stick sensitivity, vibration intensity, and more.</p><p>Unlike the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Elite Series 2 has a rechargeable battery and can run for up to 40 hours. You can charge it via USB-C or by placing it on the magnetic charging dock. The braided USB-C cable is roughly nine-feet long and can be stored in the carrying case's mesh compartment.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 released in 2019, but it's still the best premium controller for Xbox and PC. I've tested dozens of these types of controllers for all major platforms, and I have yet to find one that matches the Elite Series 2 in the ergonomics and overall feel departments. It's one of the rare controllers where the difference is immediately noticeable due to excellent weight distribution, textured grips, and sturdier shell.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594497-eliteseries2accessoreis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594497" data-ratio="0.72571428571429" data-width="700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594497-eliteseries2accessoreis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594497"></a><figcaption>Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594497-eliteseries2accessoreis.jpg"></figure><p>The Elite Series 2 previously retailed for $180, but it received a $20 bump in May when Microsoft raised the price of Xbox hardware and first-party accessories in response to the US tariff situation.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/love-and-deepspace-dark-skinned-lighting-invisible-2000640537</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-biggest-games-in-the-world-responds-to-criticism-that-its-dark-skinned-characters-are-%E2%80%98invisible%E2%80%99.1340836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I am still but a tourist enjoying the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/love-and-deepspace-zayne-edge-of-continuum-sex-scene-2000627623"><span>horny fruits of the </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>community’s labor</span></a><span>, so I guess it shouldn’t surprise me that there are months-long controversies and discourse within the gacha game I had never heard of. However, when I saw </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/love-and-deepspace-devs-respond-to-player-complaints-that-their-dark-skinned-custom-characters-are-invisible-in-cutscenes"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a> <span>reporting on dark-skinned custom characters being essentially “invisible” in some of its cutscenes, I was flabbergasted at how true it was, and that it’s apparently been an issue since the game launched last year.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>Something you’ll learn in film or art school is that you will sometimes have to frame shots, adjust lighting, and consider the environment of a scene depending on the subject’s skin tone. It’s why film and TV will often have stand-ins to help the crew adjust settings before an actor comes in to shoot their scenes. Unfortunately, a lot of filmmaking technology was </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d16LNHIEJzs"><span>made with only lighter skin tones in mind</span></a><span>, and so a lot of effort has gone into making sure that cameras can adjust for different shades. In games, too, some developers come up with ways of testing that lighting in scenes can work for a variety of skin tones, as Elizabeth Zelle who worked on the </span><i><span>Saints Row </span></i><span>games <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kohizeri.bsky.social/post/3m4irtnzvl22d">points out</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>But you have to actually use those tools and accommodate for it, or you end up with scenes like those in </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>in which, if you’re playing with a darker-skinned custom protagonist, you quite literally cannot see your character without upping the brightness of the image itself.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/Love_Deepspace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Love_Deepspace</a>  for giving us darker skin players NO LIGHTING in this new card😒 <a href="https://t.co/innx60E7et">pic.twitter.com/innx60E7et</a></p> <p>— MadameSynclair (@MoonkissedMuse) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonkissedMuse/status/1976999057332879509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Despite the game offering players a sizable amount of customization options, </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>’s lighting just isn’t optimized for darker skin tones, and publisher Infold Games has finally responded to the criticism.</span></p>

 <p><span>“At Infold Games, we’ve always believed that our games are shaped together with the players who love them,” the company said in a statement to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>. “The community’s feedback, discussions, and creative passion are what keep </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> evolving and alive. We’ve seen the conversations and truly value everyone who has taken the time to share their experiences and thoughts. Every comment, whether it’s about visuals, storytelling, or representation, helps us better understand how our work resonates across different perspectives and cultures. </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> is, at its heart, a shared world of emotion and imagination. We hope to keep building it hand in hand with our players, learning and improving together along the way.”</span></p> <p><span>The statement stops short of saying that an update is coming, but Infold does at least seem aware of the criticism. Hopefully, the issue gets addressed soon. </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>has millions of players worldwide, and I’m astounded it took almost two years for the company to acknowledge this. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We survived another October, folks! The busiest month for <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">big game releases is officially coming to a close</a> as we prepare to coast into the holiday period and the backlog season that lies beyond. And yet even now there are more great games needling their way out of the wood work at every turn. Here are three new games that came out this month that you’ve probably never heard of before and the reasons why we can’t wait to go back to playing them.</p> <p><span>***</span></p> <div> <h2 id="appHubAppName" role="heading" aria-level="1"><strong><em>Super Fantasy Kingdom</em></strong></h2>  <p role="heading" aria-level="1"><b>Play it on: </b>PC, Xbox Series X/S (on Game Pass)<b><br> </b><b>Current goal:</b> Survive for more than 20 minutes<b></b></p> </div> <p><span>It’s been a long-time coming but<em> Super Fantasy Kingdom</em> is finally out in the wild in Early Access. It’s a mashup of roguelite bullet heaven RNG and careful city planning that sort of feels like if you took an old TurboGrafx-16 RPG overworld, ratcheted-up the color saturation, and turned it into tower defense game. You search for warriors to recruit, manage your resources and kingdom’s expansion, and try to keep the enemy hordes at bay. Finding the secrets to balancing expansion and defense requires a lot of trial and error and I could see it starting to get repetitive at some point if I can’t break through to some higher tiers of strategy but for my first few brief sessions it’s kept me coming back hoping to eventually unlock the right recipe for success. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Seance of Blake Manor</i></b></h2>  <p><b>Play it on: </b>PC<span><br> </span><b>Current goal: </b>Check into a spooky, isolated hotel</p> <p><span>Traditionally here in the Weekend Guide, we sing the praises of a game we’re already playing. But I’m gonna be upfront with you: I haven’t even touched </span><i><span>The Seance of Blake Manor </span></i><span>yet. It came out earlier this week and I just haven’t had time. However, I’m definitely looking forward to digging into it this weekend. I’ve seen so many folks praise this game for its puzzles and atmosphere, and a spooky, supernatural mystery that puts my powers of deduction to the test sounds like just the thing to curl up with on Halloween weekend. Over </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-seance-of-blake-manor-impressions/"><span>in </span><i><span>Polygon </span></i><span>this week</span></a><span>, Giovanni Colantonio called it “</span><span>an ingenious exploration of grief, occult magic, and Irish folklore that’s bound to take over your free time.” And </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dannyodwyer.bsky.social/post/3m4754qid322x"><span>on Bluesky</span></a><span>, head of Noclip and actual Irish person Danny O’Dwyer called it his “favorite game of 2025 so far” and “the best game about Irish history [he’s] ever played.”That’s high praise. So I’m off to an isolated, spooky, maybe even haunted Irish manor for the countryside. Maybe I’ll see you there, wandering the halls. – Carolyn Petit&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b><i>Dispatch</i></b></h2>  <p><b>Play it on: </b>PC, PS5<span><br> </span><b>Current goal: </b><span>&nbsp;Meet the team</span></p> <p><span>One nice thing about AdHoc Studios releasing </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, its new management sim/superhero/adventure game, in pieces, is that I will have something to reliably fall back on for the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Weekend Guide for the next few weeks. I was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><span>a bit mixed on the first two episodes</span></a><span>, but I can’t deny I’ve been jonesing to get back to it now that episodes three and four have dropped. Not to mention I keep narrowly avoiding spoilers on social media, so I can’t really afford to dilly dally. But where we last left off, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>told me in no uncertain terms I’d be getting more face time with Robert Robertson III’s team of angry ex-villains, who I only really got to know through their radio banter in the first two episodes. So it will be nice to actually get to know them rather than making inferences based on how mean they are to me over a headset.&nbsp; — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

<section><p>Typing games have come a long way since Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Keyboards have more than 100 keys, but there are four that are most important to people who play video games: W, A, S, and D. There are games that use more than these keys, yes--StarCraft, League of Legends, and World of Warcraft use all sorts of combinations--but the majority of games rely on a small sampling of numbers and letters on the keyboard. There are practical reasons for this, to be sure: Computer games often require one hand on a mouse, the other on a keyboard. There are a ton of keys that are simply out of reach. If you've got two hands on the keyboard, you're probably not playing a video game. But you <em>could </em>be.</p><p dir="ltr">Typing games have existed for decades, once largely considered educational tools designed to help kids learn to use a keyboard. Millennials played games like Typer Shark and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing in their computer lab classrooms, before computers were commonplace in home offices. As computers, namely laptops, started to proliferate, computer labs started to disappear--and so did the need for educational typing games. But from the ashes of the computer lab, typing games have reemerged, pulling from the educational genres toolbox while putting a new spin on the niche genre.</p><p dir="ltr">Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, released in 1987 and developed by Software Toolworks, is <em>the</em> quintessential typing game. It wasn't the first typing game, but it was among the first. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is certainly the most prominent; Mavis herself is the face of the typing genre, even today.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the high concept--the idea that the world's best typing teacher was at your side, correcting mistakes and offering encouragement--was a big part of the appeal [of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing," developer on the game Michael Duffy told GameSpot. "The 'game' sensibilities that we successfully employed in Chessmaster--graphics and music--made the rote repetition required to learn a new motor skill fun. The typing hands showing finger placement were highly innovative in a time of primitive graphics, and kept people from looking at their hands while typing. But the illusion of Mavis herself was a big draw."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594001-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594001-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594001"></a><figcaption>Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing courtesy of Softonic, one of the few online store fronts hosting the software.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594001-ff%282%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing had several games that made it more than just a typing program: Road Race, Space Junk, and Ragtime. Each of these were largely the same--typing a prompt that scrolled across the screens--but applied different effects. Tying fast made the text scroll faster in Road Race; accurate typing helped shoot more stuff in Space Junk; and Ragtime required the player to type in rhythm with a metronome. The small tweaks to how typing impacted the states of these games is what makes them satisfying, and those same practices in making typing feel responsive and tactile in games continues to drive what makes a typing game good.</p><p dir="ltr">Z-Type is a classic type-to-shoot game originally developed in just one week by Dominic Szablewski. He said his game is appealing because of the immediate feedback. Z-Type is an arcade-style space game in which players must shoot enemy spaceships. If they hit you, you're done. It plays in rounds, with each round adding more enemies coming at you faster and faster. What makes this a typing game is that each of the enemy spaceships has a word, and some shoot letters. When you hit the first letter of a word, your spaceship shoots. So when you hit a lot of letters--typing about the letters that spell "condescending," for instance--explosions abound.</p><p dir="ltr">"Typing/shooting and seeing lots of explosions is just cool," Szablewski said. "The timing, sound effects, and graphics have to be just right to make it feel good. I spent a lot of time fiddling with these things until I had something that I liked. It's very hard to put into words, but once you have a good game loop, it just clicks."</p><p dir="ltr">He continued: "I love games that are 'easy to learn, hard to master.' Once you get better at these games, you can reach this almost zen-like state where you totally forget where your actions just 'flow' without thinking." Z-Type is perfect at creating that feeling--it just feels really good to be good at this game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594003-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594003" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594003-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594003"></a><figcaption>Phoboslab's Z-Type</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594003-ff%282%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's exactly the feeling Elecom developer Mike Smith wanted to employ in his upcoming typing beat 'em up Keys of Fury. "I got very excited about the idea of making a typing game that was face-meltingly awesome," he told GameSpot.</p><p dir="ltr">Smith's Keys of Fury, which had a demo go live during the most recent Steam Next Fest, is part of the next generation of typing games, following classics like Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and Z-Type and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484680/typing-keyboard-indie-games-textorcist-nanotale" rel="nofollow ">more recent typing hits like Nanotale and Keyboard Sports</a>. Developers are pushing the boundaries of what typing games can be, often blending genres to create something entirely new. In Keys of Fury, typing enacts the action-packed fighting. In Touch Type Tale, by Pumperknickle Studio, real-time strategy meets typing. Blood Typers, from Outer Brain Studios, used typing to power its survival horror gameplay, whereas in Glyphica: Typing Survival, typing is how you blast off waves of enemies in roguelite rounds, like an amped up Z-Type. Final Sentence, which ended the Steam Next Fest at the top of the charts, blends the battle royale formula with the genre.</p><p dir="ltr">The keyboard is not just a means for playing the game; it's central to it. "I wanted every keystroke to matter so that you get a lot of satisfaction just as you push a 'punch' button on a controller," Smith said. "I wanted every keystroke to matter. There's that immediate, satisfying attack and sound effect."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyboards are essential to many PC games, so it makes sense that typing as a mechanic would translate into all different sorts of genres. For Malte Hoffman of German developer Pumpernickle Studio, which made the 2024 release Touch Type Tale, a real-time strategy game made perfect sense to blend with typing game elements--RTS games like Starcraft 2 already use a whole lot of keyboard buttons for their various hot keys. That's how the Pumpernickle team started thinking about the idea: What if you could play a real-time strategy game with the keyboard alone? No mouse necessarily, not even to control the menus.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas a lot of older typing games focus primarily on typing fast, it's more important to be accurate in a game like Touch Type Tale. "It certainly helps if you're very fast at typing, but there's a limit," Hoffman told GameSpot. "Beyond that, typing faster doesn't help you much. Your brain is slower, because you have decisions to make." A great typing game, he said, has more opportunity than just fast typing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594004-ss_de700af3d234ba5f74ba4c791345628e59af30cf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594004" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594004-ss_de700af3d234ba5f74ba4c791345628e59af30cf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594004"></a><figcaption>Button Mash's Final Sentence.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594004-ss_de700af3d234ba5f74ba4c791345628e59af30cf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Final Sentence, from Button Mash, is another game that rewards accuracy; the battle royale certainly requires the typist to go fast, but typing accurately is equally as important. That's because, like other battle royales, Final Sentence is a multiplayer online game, and only one person can win. The setup is quite intense: Groups of 40 to 100 players enter a dimly lit room, each with their own typewriter and man with a gun. Typewriter for typing, sure. But the man with the gun? He's there to shoot you if you make too many mistakes. The catch, however, is that if you don't type fast enough, you also die. The game got so popular during the Steam Next Fest that developer Dmitry Minsky spent the entirety of the event pushing buttons on the game's Amazon Web Services console to add more and more servers.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a lot like the typing minigames from Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, actually. Except for the gun. Minsky said he knew the audience was huge for typing trainers like MonkeyType or TypeRacer, where people can test their words-per-minute. But there's backspace there. It's tense, he said, but you can always fix your mistakes. "Here, the tension is so huge that you feel it," Minsky said. "You're always stressed."</p><p dir="ltr">It's that sort of tension that drives Blood Typers, the survival horror game from four-person developer Outer Brain Studios. Blood Typers, which was released in February and had a new update go live in October, is clearly inspired by Typing of the Dead, but entirely off rails and high-stress, bloody survival, cooperative gameplay. The feeling of a gurgling zombie stumbling toward you creates a similar rush and tension: You type or you die.</p><p dir="ltr">"Typing is such a physical activity," Blood Typers developer Dmitry Pirag told GameSpot. "The physicality of it just works with the horror, and taps into something where it feels even more immersive, because you know that you're in control of every action. It's extremely skill based."</p><p dir="ltr">But Pirag said that Blood Typers had different modes that change the way the player experiences difficulty. You can make the typing elements more forgiving, giving you time to hunt and peck for keys, while also turning up the survival horror elements to make the game more difficult in a different way.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, though, if a game's system doesn't "get out of the way and let the player type," as typing roguelite Gylphica: Typing Survival developer Xuanming Zhou said, it doesn't matter how innovative it is. Mixing roguelite with typing works because neither piece gets in each other's way, he said, adding, "One is a control system; the other is a progression system."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594005-ss_cdd249dc74d96291c52d4baadad2f829f6a42c67.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594005" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594005-ss_cdd249dc74d96291c52d4baadad2f829f6a42c67.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594005"></a><figcaption>aliasBLACK's Glyphica.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594005-ss_cdd249dc74d96291c52d4baadad2f829f6a42c67.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The goal of Glyphica is to get out of the players way and let them type," Zhou said. "A roguelike progression system enables exactly that. Unlike genres defined by control schemes that might conflict with typing, roguelike mechanics fit perfectly without compromise."</p><p dir="ltr">Glyphica: Typing Survival feels like Z-Type in some ways--the player controls a turret that fires at enemies flying toward you in the middle of the screen. Each enemy has a word displayed on it, and typing that word means firing at them. Hit them before they hit you. But Glyphica: Typing Survival adds onto the classic game with its roguelite elements: the upgrades, loot, and weapons that scale with the hordes. There's a frenetic tension between the skill and speed of typing, blended with the dice roll of roguelite upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">This next generation of typing games is pulling what it needs from like eras before. But it's that past that's helped lay the groundwork necessary for the future of typing games--a future where the keyboard is a peripheral and a gameplay mechanic. Zhou said it could be called a resurgence. "Several typing games have done reasonably well recently, helping to gather a ready audience for the genre," he said. "That's probably created more confidence in the commercial vitality of typing games, reducing the risk for developers exploring them."</p><p dir="ltr">Typing games are still a niche genre, and may remain so: Typing on a keyboard isn't nearly as ubiquitous as it once was--smartphone and tablet typing has replaced the physical keyboard for some people. But a generation of people have that nostalgia for typing, and that's worth something.</p><p dir="ltr">"What connects all these games is the joy of typing, right?" Touch Type Tale developer Hoffman said. "Typing just feels satisfying. It's a great mode to connect with something that's already done, which is games. Exploring the space [and] using this great input method of typing [to play games] has a lot of opportunity."</p>

                <p>Last month, Supergiant Games officially launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2</a> out of early access, and sent the princess of the underworld, Melinoe, on a quest to defeat the titan Chronos. The original ending of the game wasn't very well-received. But in Hades 2' first post-launch patch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-coming-to-post-launch-patch-1-for-hades-2/1100-6535684/" data-ref-id="1100-6535684" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-coming-to-post-launch-patch-1-for-hades-2/1100-6535684/">the true ending</a> may give fans a better conclusion than the previous finale.</p><p>There have been some sizable additions to build up to the true ending, including new events and voiceovers, as well as changes to the fated prophecy adjustments, and the ability to use a cauldron incarnation to take you back to an earlier point in the game. However, the true ending will require a higher number of Underworld clears than before. The game's epilogue isn't being changed.</p><p>The specific changes involving the special encounters have been marked as spoilers by Supergiant. Without giving any story points away, one character may appear less frequently, and one will appear more often.</p><p>Although the game's initial ending proved divisive, GameSpot's review for Hades 2 gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">a perfect 10/10 score</a>. Near the end of September, Hades 2 reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-passes-110000-concurrent-players-on-steam-doubling-all-time-peak-for-original/1100-6535081/" data-ref-id="1100-6535081" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-passes-110000-concurrent-players-on-steam-doubling-all-time-peak-for-original/1100-6535081/">a new peak of concurrent players on Steam</a> with over 112,000. Supergiant has also thanked players <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/505090299391902120" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/505090299391902120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for all the community feedback</a> that led to the improvements in the first patch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Due to what has become our specific remit, we – or at least I, Nathan – have spent the week with eyes on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“government uses gamer memes” situation</a> like a diligent newscopter. The latest development? The Department Of Homeland Security has started sprinkling <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> in with its misunderstanding of <em>Halo</em>. But though the cultural touchstones might be new (relative to, like, the 1950s and decidedly <em>not </em>relative to modern gaming culture), the tactics are not. Viciously calling back to an imagined better time is the oldest trick in the far-right book. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we bathe in the afterglow of Aftermath’s first-ever in-person party before hinting at big changes to come (the good kind) as a result of the site’s upcoming second anniversary. <strong>Note: Due to a technical issue we learned about</strong><strong><em> right after</em></strong><strong> recording this episode, those changes will be coming the week after next – not next week, as we said during the episode. Apologies for the confusion.</strong></p><p>Then we discuss the United States government’s sudden gaming fixation, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a flood of <em>Halo </em>memes</a> from White House and Department Of Homeland Security accounts, as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JD Vance’s embarrassing reveal</a> that he not only keeps abreast of Twitch drama but is fluent in CollarGate, a widespread nontroversy about Hasan Piker turning out to be a secret dog torturer.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to Amazon’s devastating <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs-what-we-know-teams-roles-affected-job-cuts-2025-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff of 14,000 people</a>, including many of those working on<em> New World</em>, a once-popular MMO that’s now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being wound down</a>. As it turns out, like many others, Amazon tried to take on Steam, and also like many others, it <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-amazons-game-business-crumbles-the-public-is-surprised-to-discover-that-it-was-trying-to-compete-with-steam-all-this-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed miserably</a>. Finally, in honor of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise 3.0 update</a>, we share our <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em> opinions (Nintendo was too inspired by cozy games, a genre it basically invented with… <em>Animal Crossing</em>.)</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make a modern <em>Animal Crossing</em> where all the villagers verbally accost you again.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse. Who the fuck actively cares about <em>Halo </em>right now? The only reason they did that is because [Microsoft] <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that remaster</a> PlayStation is also getting – that whole conversation. I looked at that remaster and was like “If you guys want that, that’s fine.” But I can already play <em>Halo </em>multiple ways. The <em>Master Chief Collection</em> is kinda fine.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It makes me think of the sort of shared masculinity of the <em>Halo </em>choir in the bathroom – that kind of thing. Those are the good old days that they’re trying to harken back to. It also ties into the sort of <a href="https://www.404media.co/80s-nostalgia-ai-slop-is-boomerfying-the-masses-for-a-past-that-never-existed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[80s and] 90s AI slop</a> that you’ll see on nostalgia channels now, where it’s trying to imagine a past of being a white, teenage suburbanite. A world where <em>Halo </em>was non-toxic, uncomplicated fun never existed.<em> Halo</em>’s notoriousness for being a toxic game was evident from the moment that online lobbies started existing [for<em> Halo 2</em>].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Xbox Live was the original place that got called out for being full of kids saying slurs.</p><p>It’s notable too that the other series these government agencies are now drawing on is <em>Lord Of The Rings</em>. Same time period – at least, if we’re talking about the movies. They’re trying to harken back to specific people’s childhood. But that’s always what these far-right, often-fascist movements do. Remember the good old days, whatever those might be. For a while the aesthetic touchstone was the 1950s or some imagined version of it. Now it’s an imagined version of the 2000s. You’ve gotta advance it forward to keep things relevant to your prospective audience.</p><p>But yeah, they’re just running the same playbook as always, only this time on the media of our youth as opposed to that of older people.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It’s so funny that <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> is in this milieu, because most of my memory of <em>Lord Of The Rings </em>is reading gay fan fiction about it from that same time period. I was reading about the hobbits fucking each other.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>They do kinda [seem to be].</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It seems like they have, or at least that they have a very intense friendship – one of those ones where they stopped talking after a certain point in time, and then one of them comes out as gay decades later.&nbsp;</p><p>But it shows the limits of their imagination. They can’t imagine that there’s a massive group of people that also like <em>Halo </em>and<em> Lord Of The Rings</em> and nerd stuff [but are queer and progressive].</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This is the other thing I think it’s very important to note about fascism as a movement and ideology: It cannot create. It can only co-opt. That’s what it does: It finds something to latch onto and says that it either always [belonged to the far-right] or that an imagined version of it that never existed is the thing to which everyone should aspire. Again, they’re grabbing onto something that previously existed and people had strong feelings about at the time, and they’re trying to graft their own ideology onto it, regardless of what that thing was actually about or what other people read into it.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog"><h3>We Have Never Been More 12 Years Old</h3></a><p>In the same week government agencies coopted Halo, now we've also got JD Vance weighing on in CollarGate</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood"><h3>Not Commenting Is Commenting</h3></a><p>'Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter"><h3>The Trump Halo Memes Aren’t Supposed To Make Sense</h3></a><p>It's me, the sucker trying to figure them out anyway</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a stellar launch, ARC Raiders has revealed its 2025 roadmap. Over November and December, new content like Arcs, quests, and a new map will come out for the multiplayer title.</p>



<p>Having only launched on October 30th, Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders has quickly become one of Steam’s hottest titles. The extraction shooter saw big success during its beta tests and, now that it’s out, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s hit over 264,000 players</a>. In a thank you note from the team, it revealed what fans can expect from the rest of 2025 and in the coming weeks.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap-reveals-new-map-events-and-weather-conditions">ARC Raiders 2025 Roadmap Reveals New Map, Events, and Weather Conditions</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Posted on <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official blog</a>, the ARC Raiders team detailed some of the new content being added to the game via a roadmap. For November (North Line), the fifth map, Stella Montis, will drop, as well as new Arcs, weapons, and quests. Large-scale community events are also being planned for both November and December. Finally, in December (Cold Snap), snowfall will be added to the game alongside a new Raider Deck, quests, and the Expedition Departure Window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders team also shared a heartfelt thank-you note to those who played the game. The statement, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in the blog</a>, can be found below:</p>



<p><strong>“We are so thankful to have you on this journey with us, and we will continue to refine and grow the game with your feedback in mind,” </strong>the ARC Raiders team states. <strong>“Keep your eyes on the horizon. This is only the beginning of what is in store for ARC Raiders.”</strong></p>



<p>With a launch like it had, ARC Raiders has the potential to be the next best multiplayer FPS. It will be interesting to see how it develops over time and what’s in store for players next. Either way, there’s a lot to look forward to for the game, and definitely worth checking out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/darrington-drops-new-daggerheart-blood-hunter-playtest-material.1340788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has released new playtest material for its fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>. This new batch sees the debut of the <em>Daggerheart</em> Blood Hunter, an adaptation of the class created by Matt Mercer for the actual play series, Critical Role.</p>



<p>Like all <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-playtest-material-messes-with-monstrous-transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">prior playtest material</a>, the <em>Daggerheart</em> Blood Hunter playtest is available on Darrington's <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/thevoid/" rel="nofollow">The Void</a> hub. The playtest includes the Blood Hunter character sheet, a handful of printable class cards, and rules for three of its subclasses: Order of the Mutant, Ghost Slayer, and Lycan respectively.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-blood-hunter-playtest-spell-screenshot.jpg?itok=qGcY3I8N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-blood-hunter-playtest-spell-screenshot.jpg?itok=wd1IyP1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For fans of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-introduces-us-to-land-of-araman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Critical Role</a>, the Blood Hunter is a beloved character class introduced in Campaign 2 of the actual play series. The class was created by Matt Mercer and is heavily inspired by The Witcher series. The unique hook of the class is invoking blood magic, which grants the character enhanced abilities and devastating attacks. All at the cost of their own health.</p>

<p>Since its AP debut, the Blood Hunter class has been available through D&amp;D Beyond as Critical Role fan content. Aside from a redesign in 2020, the class hasn't received much official support, partially due to its nebulous status as official content for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<p>The central gimmick of trading health for power is still present in the <em>Daggerheart</em> Blood Hunter playtest. Several key features from the D&amp;D version make the jump to <em>Daggerheart</em>. Crimson Rite lets you mark a hit point and gain bonus damage. Blood Maledict costs you 3 Hope but grants advantage on action rolls against a single target. And you can still track a target with Brand of Castigation.</p>

<p>The playtest does introduce some new wrinkles such as unique spells. Blood Puppet lets you control someone, living or dead, through their blood. Lifeblood Talisman lets you create a special trinket that reduces damage taken by its wearer. There is even some support with Weave The Flesh, which lets you mark a hit point or stress to let your allies heal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A British trade union group is accusing Rockstar Games of union busting after it reportedly fired over 30 employees across offices in the UK and Canada. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vi-new-trailer-destiny-renegades-clair-obscur-1851779967"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker</a> denies the charges, however, claiming the people were terminated for “gross misconduct.”</p> <p>“Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry,” Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) president Alex Marshall said in a statement, first reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.”</p>

 <p>But Rockstar parent company Take-Two claims that’s not the case. “We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “Our culture is focused on teamwork, excellence, and kindness. Rockstar Games terminated a small number of individuals for gross misconduct, and for no other reason. As always, we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.”</p>

 <p>According to Marshall, the only people fired from Rockstar were all members of a private trade union chat group on Discord who had either signed up for IWGB membership or were thinking of doing so. While the studio is made up of thousands of employees and headquartered in New York, the biggest office is Rockstar North located in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p> <p>Best known for the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> franchises, the studio is currently working to ship <em>GTA 6</em> after its 2025 launch was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">delayed earlier this year</a>. It’s now set to arrive in May 2026. While Rockstar Games had <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466">a notorious history of crunching during development</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash">reportedly made big strides</a> in recent years in improving its work culture. A controversial return-to-office policy, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-rockstar-games-return-office-1851297508">showed there are still tensions</a> between developers and management at the studio.</p>

The Indie Fears bundle features over a dozen games for less than $20, including some instant classics like last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a> and the more often <a href="https://x.com/PATALOON/status/1950454460225872347">overlooked <em>Threshold</em></a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/indie-fears-bundle?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_indiefearsbundle_bundle">Pay at least $13</a> (or more if you want to donate something extra to the Special Effect charity for helping gamers with disabilities) and you’ll unlock PC codes for 13 games. In addition to the sci-fi mystery about crewmates stranded in space and the atmospheric horror game about an attendant at a train station in the mountains, the bundle also gets you <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, <em>Who’s Lila?</em>, <em>Order 13</em>, <em>No-Skin</em>, <em>Kiosk</em>, <em>Adios</em>, <em>The Boba Teashop</em>, <em>Daemonologie</em>, <em>Massacre at the Mirage</em>, and <em>Terror at Oakheart</em>.</p>

 <p>All of these games are highly rated on Steam, but I can personally vouch for<em> Buckshot Roulette</em> and <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, a surreal physics sim about cooking food for your fellow dissidents at a mysterious military prison. In addition to being cheap, these indie games don’t require a hulked-out PC to play them. If you have a laptop that came out in the last decade, you can probably play them just fine.</p>

 <h2>Four free games to try this Halloween</h2> <p>Okay, if $1 a piece wasn’t cheap enough for you, there are also some free horror games out there just waiting to be claimed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">First up is <em>Stasis</em></a>, a 2015 point-and-click isometric adventure about emerging from a pod during a mysterious space voyage and figuring out what the hell is going on. &nbsp;“The game’s atmosphere is thick with tension, but it’s not trying to make you sweat the whole time, so the few moments it breaks things up and hits you with something shocking, it really works,” reads our <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">original review</a>. GOG is currently giving away the standard edition DRM-free for $0.00 <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stasis?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;r=true">through November 2</a>.</p>

 <p>The Epic Games Store is also giving out <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">some Halloween freebies</a>. There’s <em>Bendy and the Ink Machine</em>, the first-person horror puzzle game in the style of old-time cartoons. Put up with its sometimes monotonous point-and-click problem solving and you’ll be rewarded with some neat storytelling.&nbsp;<em>Five Nights At Freddy’s: Into the Pit</em> is also free to claim right now. It takes the usual formula and turns it into a 2D pixel art adventure. Is it the best <em>FNaF</em> game? No. But it’s the cheapest.</p> <p>Finally, We Create Stuff, the team behind the acclaimed 2021 psychological horror puzzle game<em> In Sound Mind</em>, recently released a free game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3593490/Days_Without_Incident/"><em>Days Without Incident</em></a><em>.</em> It’s free to download and play and it’s getting some decent early Steam reviews. “This game has the same feeling as something Markiplier would have played back in the 2010s,” wrote one player. “It just oozes with old that school indie charm without relying on jump scares and loud noises every couple feet. Its definitely worth an hour of your time.”</p> <p>Sounds like a great way to spend a night pigging out <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">on overpriced candy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hades 2’s first major update, Patch 1, is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch 2. The patch notes bring some fixes for Boons and bugs, with the biggest addition being new story, <strong>expanding on the game’s True Ending</strong>.</p>



<p>Released in September, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> goes bigger and bolder than its 2020 predecessor, with more areas, Gods, and a new protagonist in Melinoe. Fighting Chronos, the god of Time, the witch will battle again and again in order to stop him from destroying the world and rescue her family. The roguelike sequel had been in Early Access since 2024 but came out in full this year to huge praise. Now the highest-rated new game of 2025, Supergiant Games’ mythological epic is poised to be quite the contender for awards. </p>



<p>However, its True Ending was met with some disappointment. Fortunately, the team has revised it, as well as seen additions. During the patch’s preview earlier this month, it seems like the ending changes are a good thing for fans. Some have expressed delight in the somewhat controversial True Ending’s fixes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1oetj2x/hades_2_ending_spoilers_i_was_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media like Reddit</a>. Now, the additions and revisions are out for all for PC and Nintendo Switch 2. Along with the ending, fixes to the game’s many Boons and bosses, as well as plenty of bugs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-reviews-liam-hemsworth-2000640506</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reviews-for-netflix%E2%80%99s-witcher-season-4-are-pretty-bad.1340728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There has been a Witcher-sized hole in my heart for several years now. Unfortunately, the return of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-henry-cavil-1851493745">Netflix’s live-action adaptation</a> is unlikely to help fill it. <em>The Witcher</em> season 4 is finally out and bingeable on the streaming service, and almost no one seems to be happy about it.</p> <p>Liam Hemsworth has debuted as the grizzled monster hunter Geralt of Rivia. Netflix even went ahead and retconned him into old scenes for the recap. Does the <em>Hunger Games</em> star earn his keep after all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/liam-hemsworth-witcher-henry-cavill-geralt-netflix-battlefield-6-2000633232">drama surrounding Henry Cavill’s seemingly tumultuous exit</a>? Doesn’t sound like it. One of the most glowing things early watchers have to say about Hemsworth is that, while he ain’t great, he’s at least not the worst thing about season 4.</p>

 <p>It’s everything else that’s apparently a weird mess. The new episodes, which started streaming on October 30, pick up with a recovering Geralt searching a war-torn countryside for surrogate daughter Ciri who is trying out life with a group of bandits while the mage Yennefer rallies others to her campaign to take down the rogue member of the member of the&nbsp;Brotherhood of Sorcerers named Vilgefortz.</p>

 <p>The show was trending in the wrong direction even during its bumpy season 3, which was awkwardly split in half, thus I’m not entirely surprised that season 4 is the Netflix adaptation’s most poorly reviewed yet. It’s currently sitting at a positive rating of just 58 percent <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_witcher/s04">on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Fan sentiment is even worse, with a user rating in the teens. “The problem isn’t that the show has a new lead actor; it’s that it continues to be a bloated mess,” writes Andrew Webster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/810151/the-witcher-season-4-review-netflix-liam-hemsworth">at<em> The Verge</em></a>. “No amount of imaginative swordplay or inventive creature design can prevent the sense that The <em>Witcher</em> is now what all sword and sorcery epics fear becoming: pure bilge,” wrote Nick Hilton <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-witcher-season-4-netflix-liam-hemsworth-review-b2854691.html">at <em>The Independent</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The problems go beyond Hemsworth, though. “The tone remains wildly uneven, lurching as it does between steeple-fingered <em>Game of Thrones</em>-y glumness and those early-90s Saturday afternoon series in which an uncommunicative hunk wanders between small communities, rescuing imperiled innocents from baddies while learning about the true meaning of friendship,” wrote Sarah Dempster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/30/the-witcher-season-four-review-liam-hemsworth-replaces-henry-cavill-review">at <em>The Guardian</em></a>. Solving that contradiction was what<em> The Witcher 3</em> video game did so well, and what the show has failed at more and more with each successive season.</p>

 <p>Not everyone’s so down on <em>The Witcher</em>‘s return. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-review-liam-hemsworth"><em>IGN</em></a>‘s Matt Fowler called it “incomplete” but congratulated it on “more successes than missteps,” while <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/netflix/the-witcher-season-4-review"><em>Paste Magazine</em></a>‘s Lacy Baugher called it “wildly satisfying” as a spin-off about the tormented mage Yennefer, played by the excellent Anya Chalotra. But many fans aren’t having it. “Don’t mind Hemsworth as Geralt,” <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_witcher/s04/reviews?type=user">conceded</a> one Rotten Tomatoes user. “It’s tough being second and he’s notable different to Cavill. The real issue with season 4 is the direction. It’s corndog crap. Witches on brooms, swearing birds, priests that burn children being aided by the crew of the Black Pearl, it’s just nonsense.”</p>

 <p>Beyond these eight new episodes, a season 5 is still supposedly in the works. After that? It sounds like Netflix is ready to call it. “By the time we wrap Season 5 fully, it will have been nine years of my life,” showrunner Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-witcher-could-netflix-show-survive-without-geralt-henry-cavill-exit-3277462/">told <em>Dexerto</em></a>. “I think there are so many more stories to be told in <em>The Witcher</em> universe, truly.  But I also think you have to step back and accept gracefully, what is the end of this story that we’ve been telling?”</p> <p>At least by then, CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-ciri-trailer-gameplay-ue5-tech-demo-1851783467"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a> will probably be out. It will similarly be moving from one lead to another, focusing on Ciri instead of Geralt. Hopefully, that transition goes much smoother.</p>

              <p>The end of October is here, which means the spooky decorations are about to make way for snow, presents, and mistletoe. But before we say goodbye to the jack-o-lanterns and trick-or-treating, we can still pay tribute to the spookiest, the scariest, the ghouliest(?) of Pokémon: the ghost types.</p> <p>Over the years, ghost Pokémon have exploded in number, starting from just <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gastly-anime-episode-ghost-of-maidens-peak-1850892373">the Gastly line</a>, which was their sole representative in the original games, to now dozens of critters haunting the Pokémon world. Ghost-type Pokémon Pokédex entries include some of the most <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530">terrifying lore dumps</a> in this typically all-ages series, and that’s what makes them some of the most interesting. But while we’d love to give every ghost-type friend their due, today we’ve narrowed it down to the 10 creepiest, spookiest, and most memorable lines in the first nine generations of Pokémon. That was a tough challenge, because there are some pretty remarkable ghosts in these games. But before we get to the honorees, here are the honorable mentions:</p> <ul> <li>Aegislash</li> <li>Cursola</li> <li>Dragapult</li> <li>Drifblim</li> <li>Froslass</li> <li>Galarian Marowak</li> <li>Gholdengo</li> <li>Golurk</li> <li>Hisuian Typhlosion</li> <li>Houndstone</li> <li>Mismagius</li> <li>Polteageist</li> <li>Rotom</li> <li>Skeledirge</li> </ul> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) has removed a “controversial” Battlefield 6 skin from both the base Battlefield 6 multiplayer and REDSEC in response to backlash online: “Wicked Grin”</p>



<p>The Wicked Grin is black and blue skin with a sharp-toothed design on the mask.  It was announced as a new skin for players to unlock as part of Battlefield 6 Season 1, but immediately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players took to platforms</a> like Reddit to voice their frustrations.</p>



<p>There were even players vowing not to revive anyone who was using the skin in-game. </p>



<p>Season 1 began on October 1, and within days, the skin was quietly removed as players continued to comment on the skin. There’s been absolutely no communication from EA on the decision.</p>



<p>In its place is a new “Standard Issue” military skin that you can see below, along with the Wicked Grin Skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment on why the Wicked Grin skin was removed. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Three weeks ago on this day, I featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-october-10">Mega Evolution in my weekly Crashers and Climbers article</a>, which focused on the set doing the typical evening out after the drop of a new set. Some cards were going up, some were going down, business as usual. Damn sneaker heads!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to today, after a seemingly massive print run, everything is crashing. Literally every card you can pick out of this set is seeing new lows. For me, this is a market correction after a year of inflated prices both on the sealed and single card markets for a variety of factors I've discussed before.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution: All Crashers And Zero Climbs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst I don't think we're seeing the bubble burst on the market just yet, we're seeing a massive market correction that could see a decline in scalped product and more availability across the board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can't tell by now, I won't be including a "Climbers" section today, but I'll be diving into just how much values have crashed in the last three weeks and bag my readers a few bargains in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the top cards from Mega Evolution at a glance, and we're seeing between 8% and 33% drops in just three weeks. Full disclosure, the "Original Prices" on these cards are what I recorded on 10th October, just so we're on the same page.</p><p id="bulbasaur-133132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bulbasaur - 133/132">Bulbasaur - 133/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229411"><div id="229411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like N's Reshiram Illustration Rare in Journey Together, this Bulbasaur Illustration Rare has a Mega Evolution Stamped version that's packed into every Enhanced Booster Box. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's a bit of a tough one to say which one is rarer, although I'd put my Pokédollars on the stamped version getting rarer over time. Needless to say it's a gorgeous card either way that's dropped by 23% from October 10.</p></div><p id="bulbasaur-133132-mega-evolution"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution ">Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution Stamp)</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229410"><div id="229410" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution Stamp)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar scenario with the Mega Evolution Stamp variant of Bulby, but the floor on this card seems to be a little higher than the standard IR. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It still dropped by 23%, but we're seein it retain a couple of dollars more in value. When you're right, you're right.</p></div><p id="mega-kangaskhan-ex-182132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132">Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229406"><div id="229406" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Khankaskhan ex SIR has only had an 8% drop, but it's a drop none-the-less. This card hardly broke expectations on the market, securing a low-end SIR level of value out the gate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So whilst we're not seeing dramatic crashes here, we've got a solid value on this card that should only rise over time.</p></div><p id="mega-absol-ex-180132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Absol ex - 180/132">Mega Absol ex - 180/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229992"><div id="229992" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Absol ex - 180/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Absol ex SIR is an absolute banger, and in my opinion one of the best from this set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some reason this card didn't go mad when Mega Evolution came out, but it's still had a drop of 9% to a respectable $96.01 at the moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is such an underated card, and I'd highly reccomend snapping it up whilst values are down.</p></div><p id="alakazam-003-staff"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alakazam - 003 (Staff)">Alakazam - 003 (Staff)</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229991"><div id="229991" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam - 003 (Staff)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Staff cards are always ridiculous value-wise due to the small distribution base and not being available in booster packs. A handfull are given out at Pokémon TCG events such as tournaments, and this one has actually dropped by 16%. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Secondary market prices always go off what people are willing to pay, but it's still a coin flip situation. If you collect staff cards, It might be worth picking up whilst it's nearly $30 less than October 10.</p></div><p id="mega-latias-ex-181132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Latias ex - 181/132">Mega Latias ex - 181/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229404"><div id="229404" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Latias ex - 181/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At over $20 cheaper and a 13% price crash, I'd bit for Mega Latias ex SIR for under $150. It's a gorgeous card and has ridiculously expresive artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't see this card loosing a lot more value, so i'd recommend picking this bad boy up before it shoots back up.</p></div><p id="mega-venusaur-ex-177132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132">Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229405"><div id="229405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Venusaur is the best generation one starter and i'll live on that hill, because I can't die with Venusaur at my side. Correct opinions aside, this card is getting more and more affordable has time goes on, In just three weeks this card has dropped by over $30, or 20%, to $174.80. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I think this card can settle to $150, but that's just a gut feeling. Considering how playable it is with the help of Meganium, this feels like a good price.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-178132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229403"><div id="229403" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the chase card of the set for those who don't like Gold Hyper Rares, just look at it. Not only is Gardevoir a fan favorite (Let's forget about that life-sized weeb plush), but its a work of art. This has crashed massively by over $80, to a much more respectable $234.99, and i'd put a solid bet on this card climbing right back up in no time. </p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-179132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 179/132">Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229409"><div id="229409" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is my favorite card of the set, featuring an expresive sky-high battle over Luminoise City between Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur. For me it's a continuation of the Charizard V Alt Art from the Sword and Shield era featuring Venusaur. Top tier artwork and two fan favorite Pokémon and it's 20% down on Oct. 10, it's a great time to buy this card.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-187132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229407"><div id="229407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This gold rare has had one of the biggest drops i've seen for a while. This was going for $600 on Oct. 10, and it's dropped by a massive 33% to $399, which I think is about the right value for it now. If history teaches us anything, Gold Rares go down not up. But the unique embossed patterns and rainbow holo effect Mega Evolution Gold Rares have seems to be turning more heads. Personally it's not for me, but it's a tied top chase card with Mega Lucario ex Gold Rare.</p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-188132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 188/132">Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229402"><div id="229402" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think $530 is eye-watering, this card was a massive $630 three weeks ago, so it's deffinately moving in the right direction. One thing i've noticed about Mega Evolution cards today, is that we're at the point where the cards have hit a new flooor. This will bring more buyers in, create more demand and we'll see a rise once again. So if you were after this card, now is likely the best time to get locked in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every now and then, some suit at a publisher looks at a beloved series they own, realizes they could make it into a live service co-op game, and says, out loud, “I know this has never worked for anyone else, but it might work for <em>us</em>.” It never does, of course; it makes the original fanbase angry, and oftentimes the franchise is old enough that new players don’t even know what it is. The result is a game for no one, a whole lot of nothing driven by market forces and the deluded belief that somehow, some way, this time the idea is just <em>better</em> than all of the previous times it’s been tried. This time, they, chosen by God, will be immune from whatever effects have frustrated lesser mortals. The latest game in this doomed genre is Painkiller, a reboot of People Can Fly’s 2004 cult classic, and the result is the same as it ever was. It’s fitting that it takes place in Purgatory. When it is consigned to the graveyard of history, its headstone will read “Here lies Painkiller, neither good enough to get into heaven nor bad enough to be damned to the inferno. You’ll wish you’d just played the original and called it a day, or simply booted up the Judas Priest song instead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Painkiller is one of <em>those</em> co-op games. You know the ones; a brief tutorial frontloads the meager plot, shows you the ropes and unlocks your base of operations. Once established, you pick from one of four visually-distinct-but-aside-from-one-passive-ability-virtually-identical-characters, all of whom come with pre-packaged quips that mostly sound like they were written by Dollar Store Joss Whedon. After selecting your weapons and loadout, you choose one of several missions, where you go to a place and kill a lot of bad guys, then return to your base with the spoils, where you can upgrade your stuff, and do it all again. You have seen all of this before, and I’m already bored describing it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story here is basically nonexistent. You are one of four souls stuck in Purgatory – Ink, Void, Roch, and Sol – approached by the disembodied voice of the angel Metatron to stop the demon Azazel, another faceless voice, from Doing Something Bad. Go on mission, go home, spend spoils, repeat. To Painkiller's infinite credit, there is no paid currency or battle pass here, just a Season Pass with skins and the like, But the loop never varies – once you get New and Better Stuff, it's just time to go do whatever Metratron determines needs doing next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That really doesn’t sound like Painkiller,” you might say if you played the original – and you, reader, you win the solid gold Kewpie doll, because it isn’t like Painkiller at all! If you squint, you can see the inspirations, though I use this term loosely. There are tarot cards, though you “win” a selection of them by spending gold in the Tarot Lottery because everything about video games is gambling now (even if you’re not spending real money), and equip them before missions for bonuses like +50 health and 30% more damage. Once the mission is over, your tarot cards are used up and you either have to spend more gold in the lottery or Ancient Souls, which you earn during missions, to restore one you’ve previously used. You can also use these currencies to buy and upgrade weapons, and you generally won’t have enough to do that and have tarot cards early on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isn't a Painkiller game; it's Warhammer 40k: Darktide wearing a Painkiller suit.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, much of the original game’s iconic arsenal has been resurrected here like the Stakegun and Electrodriver, complete with their amusing alt fires. However, the titular Painkiller (which you always have) is now doing its best impression of Doom Eternal’s chainsaw, there to get you more ammo when your other guns run out. Sometimes, levels will lock you into a large, usually circular or rectangular space and make you kill a lot of enemies, though none of them are as visually striking or bats**t insane as the original rogues’ gallery. The similarities end there. This is not a Painkiller game; it is Warhammer 40,000: Darktide wearing a Painkiller skin suit, and hoping nobody cares enough to notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Painkiller looks good, but its problems really come down to mission design. Environments feel samey even when they look different, and each of the three acts (which are three levels apiece) finds a single gameplay idea and never lets go of it. Your progress will be stopped by <em>something</em> and the only way through will be Doing That Act’s Mechanic: in the first, that means filling barrels with blood by killing enemies near them and then slotting those into the proper place; in the second, you’ll need to find and use soul containers to power things; in the third, you’ll have to stand on ritual markers to activate dreamcatchers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Occasionally, Painkiller will mix it up a bit – I actually liked the spots where my team had to use the soul containers to power a large cart we had to escort, but moments like that are rare. Mostly, you do the same things over and over again, moving through the environments, collecting gold, finding hidden chests, and picking up consumables –one plops down health; another plops down ammo; the third is a mostly useless decoy you will never pick up unless the other two are not available; and the fourth is an extra life; that’s it. You’re then locked into a combat arena until you either get enough blood canisters/soul containers/dreamcatchers to proceed or everything barring your path is dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the combat isn’t as satisfying as it should be. Most enemies are cohorts, harmless by themselves but potentially dangerous in large numbers (and they <em>always</em> come in large numbers) that die easily. There are also larger, more dangerous demons you can stagger by pouring on alt fires or kill outright, and the end of act Nephilim, who serve as bosses. None of these are all that engaging aside from the Nephilim, and while there are several different kinds of cohorts and a handful of demons, none of them have much of a unique visual identity. There are no Psychonuns or Hell Bikers or Evil Samurai or Freaks, nothing that made the original game’s wacky evil ensemble memorable. No, this is Purgatory by way of a heavy metal album cover if it were generated by AI. If you’re going to do Painkiller, it could at least <em>look like </em>Painkiller, you know?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's Purgatory by way of a heavy metal album cover if it were generated by AI.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most infuriatingly, Painkiller isn’t out and out <em>bad. </em>The movement is fast, precise, and a hell of a time – you can slide, dash, air dash, <em>dash</em> <em>through enemies,</em> bounce off walls for a double jump, and use the Painkiller to grapple to various anchor points (or enemies!). All six of the guns, whether it’s the Electrodriver, Rocket Launcher, Hand Cannon, Stakegun, Shotgun, or SMG, feel great, and I liked messing around with the various alt fires. A shotgun that freezes enemies so I can shatter them? Neat. A Stakegun that’s also a grenade launcher or can create a gravity well? Love it. Turning the Rocket Launcher into a minigun that shoots rockets that freeze? Sign me up. And getting a new upgrade on a weapon’s branching paths feels meaningful and changes how you play. Yeah, a lot of it is “we have Doom Eternal at home,” but if you’re going to steal, you might as well steal from the best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I even came to enjoy the characters, particularly Sol, a haughty, eternally youthful priestess, and Void, a straight man with a self-described fishbowl for a head and no memory of his past. Even Ink’s sarcasm and self-loathing and Roch’s tragic backstory aren’t poorly written, really. (The bad stuff is reserved for in-combat dialogue.) The issue is you rarely get to hear them finish telling each other their stories because you’ll run into some enemies and the background heavy metal (which is good) will kick in, or another character will spout some inane combat dialogue and the story dialogue you were hearing will just stop dead and never resume. Yeah, you can read it in the codex at your home base, but it’s not voiced, and the voice cast does admirable work with what they have. Bummer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss fights against the Nephilim are pretty good, too. They’re not groundbreaking – you’ve seen a lot of these mechanics before – but they’re engaging to play and they look cool, whether it’s a massive blood rat, a big statue hiding a secret, or a literal dragon. These are the best parts of the roughly four or so hours it takes to play straight through Painkiller’s Raid (read: campaign) mode, and a nice change of pace from the “we’re not locked in here with you, you’re locked in here with <em>us</em>” standard encounters.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Co-op Shooters</h3><p>There are a lot of co-op shooters out there. Here are the best ones.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Painkiller is designed as a three-player co-op game, and that’s the best way to play it, but if you’re short on friends or nobody’s around online, the bots are pretty good and respond well to player commands. Ordering them to stand on a switch to open a secret area is less intuitive than one of your co-op partners seeing the switch and just doing it, but it works, and I didn’t mind playing with bots when no one else was on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disappointment still manages to creep in, though. I figured Painkiller’s blink-and-you’ll-miss it plot was setting us up for a showdown with Azazel when we finished all nine levels, but nope. You just get access to his empty tomb where his voice offers you the chance to work for him. Your character naturally declines and he pivots to offering, and I kid you not, this is an actual line of dialogue, “a higher difficulty” and the opportunity for more violence and chaos. Sure, Azazel, why not? I’m already having <em>so</em> much fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also a roguelike mode to try out, and I enjoyed it because, unlike the Raid levels, there’s a lot more variety, and you can take your rewards back with you. You might navigate a platforming segment between fights that hurts you for as long as you’re in it or have to bring soul canisters up to the top of a ziggurat. Even the “we’re gonna lock you in a combat arena until either everything else is dead or all of you are” bits are more fun here just because you haven’t seen these environments before, and the randomized nature of your weapons, alt fires, and tarot cards feels more natural. It’s like this is what the Painkiller reboot was <em>supposed to be</em> before someone decided it should have a campaign, too. Unfortunately, during my first roguelike run, my game crashed. Talk about being damned.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Painkiller is a frustrating game. The designs for the Raid levels and enemies are largely disappointing, the story is nearly nonexistent and ends on a low note, and the Great Value Wheedonisms the characters deploy in combat often had my eyes nearly rolling out of their sockets. But I can’t dismiss it outright, either. The movement and weapons are a lot of fun, the bosses are memorable, I grew to like the characters, and the roguelike mode feels like what Painkiller wants to be. Like its characters, this is a game stuck in-between. Unworthy of heaven, but not bad enough for hell. I can’t imagine who this is for, because it’s not Painkiller fans, and even as a co-op game, it’s held back by obvious limitations. It’s a game about nothing for no one, a mediocre resurrection of a classic trying to put a new cover on an old book and hoping it still has some relevance 21 years later. Yeah. Purgatory sounds about right.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/painkiller-2025-review]]></content:encoded>

laptop. The 15.6-inch LCD screen has a 144Hz refresh rate and Nvidia's G-Sync adaptive frame rate tech. It has a full 100% standard RGB color gamut, which often isn't the case with gaming laptops in this price range. It offers 300 nits brightness and has an anti-glare coating.</p><p>The GeForce RTX 5050 GPU is an entry-level graphics card--at least when compared to the rest of Nvidia's 50 Series lineup. It offers nice improvements compared to the RTX 4050, but it's not quite as good as the RTX 4060. Don't expect to play the latest AAA games on high settings, but you can play many games in 1080p at 60fps thanks DLSS upscaling. If you want to connect your laptop to a monitor for 1440p or 4K gaming, you will need to look elsewhere; the 5050 is only suitable for 1080p.</p><p>The Intel Core i5-13450HX is an entry-level processor with 10 CPU cores and 16 threads.

                <p>Embark Studios is clearly keen to keep building on the success of its latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. The extraction shooter, which just launched to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-already-broken-a-steam-concurrent-players-record-for-extraction-shooters/1100-6535848/" data-ref-id="1100-6535848">biggest player numbers</a> on Steam for the niche genre, is already growing and now there's a roadmap outlining its trajectory.</p><p>Arc Raiders' roadmap provides a glimpse at the months ahead for the fresh third-person shooter on the market. As is typically the case, the live-service game will be receiving frequent updates fine-tuning the experience, ironing out any kinks, and steadily rolling out new cosmetics, feats and trials, as well as map conditions that should liven the playing field.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594476"></a><figcaption>Arc Raiders roadmap for the next several months.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>The most exciting news though has to do with two updates coming in November and December, respectively. The first is dubbed North Line, and it will feature an entirely new map called Stella Montis, bringing Arc Raiders' map count to five. North Line will also introduce a new community unlock event--these are typically goals and challenges for the entire game's community to work towards in order to unlock a reward--as well as equipment and quests. There will even be two new Arcs, the game's robotic enemies which tower over players, called the Matriarch and Shredder.</p><p>Just a month later in December, another update called Cold Snap will be dropping just in time for the brisk winter holidays. As the name suggests, a new arctic map condition will arrive in the game as well as a complementary event called Flickering Flames. I reckon players should start preparing to fight one another in order to stay warm come December.</p><p>Both updates will also let players rediscover "what was lost in expanded Quests," according to Embark's announcement post. Only the Cold Snap update in December will pack in a Raider Deck though, Arc Raiders' rendition of a battle pass.</p>

I know, I know, such a hot take puts me in a niche of... about 98% of people that read this site, but what I mean to say is that when the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the 3.0 update were announced yesterday, I was about as excited as Blathers when you deliver him a fourth Fossil in one day. That's <em>very excited</em>.</p>
<p>I spent the evening grinning about the return of Sonny Resetti, the Mineru Villager (!!), all of the design potential that comes with the Hotel Resort, and bulk crafting! I was even pretty pleased with the Switch 2-specific features like Mouse Mode and GameChat, perhaps not quite as big as the additions that the 3.0 update will provide, but a nice little bonus for four quid.</p>
<p>But then, as I settled into bed after an evening of counting the days until 15th January (77 today, for those interested), I was met with a little pang of worry. "If the New Horizons Switch 2 Edition is arriving with this much pomp," I thought to myself, "it's going to be <em>years</em> until we get a new Animal Crossing!"</p>
<figure data-uuid="d7a897ef76bd6"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7a897ef76bd6/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>If only we could fast forward to the next entry, eh? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't to say I'm particularly keen to move on from New Horizons — if those lockdown months taught me anything, it was that I could play this game forever (given the time) — but I realised that a lot of my Switch 2 excitement was built on seeing what comes next. I've already <em>played</em> New Horizons, and no amount of home storage expansion is going to feel as fresh as a new entry.</p>
<p>I'm starting to see the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions as a big ol' placeholder in Nintendo's release schedule. It's one of those 'we're not quite ready to show you what's next, so here's something familiar to keep you busy in the meantime' moments that we're becoming increasingly well acquainted with. Surely a brand new game would be a much better prospect for console sales?</p>
<p>It was a similar story on Switch. Rather than give us a new Mario Kart, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>; instead of a new 3D Mario, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>. They're great games, no doubt, but they're also a telltale sign of 'you're years away from a new entry, mate'.</p>
<p>And I don't want that for Animal Crossing. New Horizons launched over five years ago *<em>gulp</em>*, and while that's hardly a <em>long</em> wait between series entries, the arrival of the Switch 2 Edition makes me think that Nintendo could easily make us wait another five.Throw in some unexpected content updates a few years down the line to sweeten the deal, à la MK8D's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a>, and we might end up waiting even longer, forever convinced that the 2020 game is delivering something new.</p>

<p>I have no idea where we go next after New Horizons, but I thought the same thing after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a>, and look where that left us! All the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does is delay the next entry. I'll jump back into ACNH and have a wonderful time doing so, but it won't capture the magic of terraforming your island the first time, will it?</p>
<p>More pressingly, putting my industry cap on for a second, Animal Crossing is a system seller. Unless Nintendo has another global pandemic up its sleeve, I can't imagine that a new series entry would hit the 48 million sales that New Horizons mustered, but people would <em>flock</em> to it, all the same. In a launch year that's been criticised for its re-releases, wouldn't 'Animal Crossing: Newer Horizons' be the big push to go out and nab a Switch 2?</p>
<p>It all feels like many of the same concerns that I've had with the console in general these past few months. I think the year-one lineup is fantastic, but I'm fortunate because I <em>like</em> most of the games that are getting re-released. No amount of graphical upgrades or Mouse Mode inclusions can overshadow the fact that these are games that I, and many other people, have played before, some of them just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, this is how console launches work these days, and compared to the Xbox Series or the PS5, the Switch 2 is already off to a flying start as far as its software is concerned.</p>
<p>I also need to remind myself that the past four months haven't been wall-to-wall NS2 Editions. In terms of exclusives, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are right around the corner, then we've got new Switch 2 entries for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem</a> already lined up for 2026. You compare that to the PS5's exclusives list for its first couple of years, and it's a firm reminder that we're eating good!</p>

<p>But I think we're still missing the real big hitter. The Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> seemed like a fair stand-in for a new entry in that series (we have had two newbies in the past two years, to be fair), Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the obvious substitute for a 3D Mario, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> will have us covered on the 2D front soon enough, too.</p>
<p>I was hoping that Animal Crossing would be the biggie to make everyone go, "Yes, now I <em>need</em> a Switch 2", but I fear that January's re-release is a sign that we still have a long wait ahead of us before we can see what Newer Horizons will look like.</p>
