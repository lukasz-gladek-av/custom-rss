            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fitness trackers solve the accountability problem that derails workout consistency by providing objective data on activity levels, sleep quality and health metrics that self-assessment consistently misjudges. The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 is the company’s most advanced fitness band</strong> through refined sensors, expanded app integration and comprehensive health monitoring that rivals smartwatches costing twice as much.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/">At $99, down from $159, this flagship tracker has hit a record-low price </a>on Amazon for Black Friday while including six months of Fitbit Premium membership that unlocks advanced analytics and personalized guidance. The <strong>38% discount</strong> makes serious fitness tracking accessible to casual exercisers who want data-driven insights without smartwatch complexity or expense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Tracker</h2>
<p>The Bluetooth-enabled heart rate transmission feature means that your<strong> real-time heart rate information</strong> can be directly transferred to compatible exercise equipment in the gym, such as treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bicycles, in order to accurately determine the number of calories that you’ve burned.</p>
<p>The use of your exercise equipment and your personal health tracker means that you don’t have to wear the uncomfortable chest strap monitors offered by the gym, and spin classes are immensely improved when the bike computer shows you your actual heart rate zones, rather than approximate averages.</p>



<p><strong>Integration with the Google app enables you to manage Maps, Wallet, and YouTube Music</strong> right on your wrist. The seamless connectivity offered by the Google ecosystem enables you to access your walking and cycling directions without having to refer to your phone. The functionality also enables you to make contactless payments using your Google Wallet when checking out. The integration with the Google app sets the Charge 6 apart from other models, including the earlier Fitbit models, because they worked in isolation from the technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>The<strong> GPS feature provides mapping and pace analysis for outdoor running, walking, and biking activities</strong> without the need for connectivity, making it possible to exercise using the phone in a phone-free manner. The GPS in the phone works accurately like a running watch using multi-satellite technology that keeps the lock despite tree coverage and buildings. The <strong>maps provided after exercise offer the accurate routes, pace, and zones</strong> corresponding to different segments.</p>



<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring</strong> enables the observation of resting heart rate trends that may signify an improvement in cardiovascular performance and the onset of overtraining, and the feature related to sleeping enables the monitoring and evaluation of light, deep, and REM sleep stages. The optical heart rate sensor provides constant contact using the flexible band, enabling the fitment of different wrists using the provided small and large bands.</p>
<p>The<strong> bundle comes with an included six-month subscription to the service</strong>: This service has several advanced features, such as in-depth sleep tools with personalized advice, exercise plans with different difficulty levels, mindfulness exercises designed for stress relief, and health charts that enable tracking long-term trends. Regular members would have access to readiness scores, which provide an overall readiness indicator through the integration of scores related to their sleeping, activity, and Heart Rate Variability. The cost would be $9.99 a month, and the service would be worth $60.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery duration of a week ensures the use of the tracker continuously and 24/7,</strong> without the need to remove the tracker every night and undergo the process of frequent recharging, like in the case of other smart watches. The battery can be quickly recharged and it takes only about two hours to do so in case it needs recharging, even though the tracker can be recharged on a weekly basis when the user takes a shower.</p>
<p>With the Fitbit Charge 6 at just $99, you get the ability to wireless heart rate broadcast, integration with the Google app, GPS, health monitoring, six months of health and fitness insights through the health and fitness service, and a battery life up to seven days on a charge, all at 38% lower than the usual cost and available on Black Friday.</p>

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> deals are officially here, and right now you'll find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft Physical Edition</a> on PS5 for its lowest price ever. It's discounted to just $25 (was $30), so if you haven't yet played the iconic game, this is a great chance to dive in (or snag it as an affordable gift for a friend or family member). The discount doesn't seem like much, but it comes bundled with 3,500 Tokens, which typically cost $20. This version of Minecraft doesn't see many discounts. It briefly dropped its price by a few bucks during the summer, but this Black Friday deal is the best we've seen. If you're looking for a holiday gift for a younger gamer in your life, this is likely a good choice--just keep in mind this discount only applies to the physical PS5 version.</p><div title="6536428 - Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) (BF2025)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5071" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536428 - Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) (BF2025)" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Minecraft-PlayStation-5\/dp\/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Minecraft-PlayStation-5\/dp\/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$25 (was $30)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>While you'll find <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/212779" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft</a> for $20 at most digital storefronts, this physical edition deal is actually the better offer.

<p>Support for "GameCube adapters in Wii U mode" also added</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d47e43c4fbfc2"><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d47e43c4fbfc2/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>During the original Switch generation, PC gaming giant Valve added Nintendo controller support to its Steam client.</p>
<p>Now that the Switch 2 has arrived on the scene, Valve has issued a Steam Client Beta update for November 2025 that adds support for the Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Added support for Nintendo Switch 2 controllers connected over USB on Windows"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve has also "added support for GameCube adapters in Wii U mode with rumble on Windows". So you can now use wired GameCube controllers with this accessory. You can see the official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/599669707226744434">patch notes on the Steam community page</a>.</p>
<p>Steam has previously added support for Nintendo's original Switch Pro Controller.

"Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter, which means there are technically several popular games like it, but I've never played a game in the genre that's as unpredictable, thrilling, and--perhaps most surprising of all--hopeful," wrote critic Mark Delaney. "We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played."</p><p>Arc Raiders isn't the only great shooter on sale at Fanatical.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-supplies-amazon-millions-of-galaxy-buds-3-pro-to-clear-stock-now-at-new-all-time-low-2000647746</link>
            <guid>1366033</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple and Samsung battle across smartphones, tablets and increasingly in the wireless earbuds category where both companies push technological boundaries through annual releases. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro compete directly with the new AirPods Pro 3</strong>&nbsp;and matches capabilities in active noise cancellation and AI-powered features that define premium earbuds in 2024.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">$159, down from $249, Samsung’s flagship earbuds</a> undercut Apple’s $249 retail pricing by $90 during Black Friday on Amazon and creates an obvious choice for value-conscious buyers. The decision becomes even clearer for Android smartphone owners who benefit from Samsung’s ecosystem integration that Apple deliberately restricts on non-iOS devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation Capable of Thinking on Its Own</h2>
<p>The <strong>adaptive active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI constantly monitors the environment</strong> and changes the strength of the filter on its own, without the need to switch between fixed settings. When you leave the quiet offices and enter the bustling street, the intensity of the noise-cancelling effect changes on its own, and when you enter the restaurant, you are no longer in a bubble. By contrast, the need to switch between different modes on the typical ANC earbuds means you are forced to use the technology in a way that always slightly misses the mark.</p>



<p>The reworked stem-style design and ability to personalize the blade lights help differentiate the product and offer an improved fit over some models in the past lineup, namely the bean-shaped Galaxy Buds, where there was an occasional fit issue related to insecurity when engaging in vigorous dynamic action. The stem style enables leverage, keeping the earbuds in the proper location when running, working out, and engaging in other actions where stemless models are dislodged. The lights help personalize the product through custom color and patterning, reflecting the user’s personality, and making the earbuds themselves rather than the phone the fashion statement.</p>
<p><strong>Sound optimization using the Adaptive Equalizer examines the fit of the earbuds in your ear</strong> and optimizes the audio response. In cases where the audio leaks because the fit isn’t tight, the EQ adds bass, and in cases where the fit is tight, the bass reduces because too much would cause muddy tones. These adjustments occur, in effect, on their own when wearing the earbuds.</p>



<p>The <strong>Real-Time Interpreter feature functions by facilitating the direct conversation</strong> and translation process using the earbuds when interacting with people who don’t speak English, and the translations appear on your phone screen. The use of an AI Real-Time Interpreter feature when traveling internationally gains even less relevance in situations where you need directions, order food, and hold business conversations in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The intuitive touch controls make programming gesture controls available for the functions in accordance with your priorities, rather than adopting the pre-programmed settings provided by Samsung. Customization options include double-tap functionality for triggering the voice assistant, triple-tap functionality for skipping songs, and long press functionality for switching between ANC settings, according to your priority functions.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP57 water and dust resistance offered by the earbuds</strong> protects against the type of perspired moisture in the gym, rain, and accidental splashes, all accomplished without the fear that typically undermines great-sounding earbuds when they come into contact with moisture, driving up the cost of quality earbuds in the first place. The double warranty on the Amazon product protects against typical replacements, double the typical warranty periods and ensures its quality outweighs the cost upfront.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are available on Black Friday at 36% off the regular price and come with Adaptive ANC, AI sound optimization, real-time translations, customizable controls, an IP57 water resistant rating, and a two-year warranty all in a $159 package. The $90 price gap in the AirPods Pro 3, courtesy of Samsung, means there’s no contest here when it comes to choosing the right wireless earbuds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>What if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Valve’s Steam Machine</a> were a 3.8-liter tower instead of a 3.8-liter cube, with a desktop-grade Nvidia RTX 5060 GPU instead of an AMD RX 7600 — plus a more powerful CPU and many faster ports? Well, it’d cost you nearly $1,500 and be called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.minisforum.com%2Fproducts%2Fminisforum-g1-pro%3Fvariant%3D47325699408117" rel="sponsored">the Minisforum AtomMan G1 Pro</a>.</p><p>Minisforum is one of the only companies shipping such powerful discrete GPUs in mini-PCs, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-mini-pc-review/">its earlier AtomMan G7 PT</a> is the closest thing anyone’s sold to Valve’s own spec. But the new G1 Pro might be a better competitor now it’s got an integrated power supply (like Valve) and even beefier components.</p><p>The most surprising feature is a full but lilliputian desktop graphics card — look how cute it is in the render below! — that fits into the top of the chassis. (Minisforum doesn’t claim it’s upgradable, just FYI, but does boast that it offers the full 145W of power you’d get in other desktop 5060 cards.)</p><p>And, in “Beast Mode,” Minisforum says it can drive the AMD Ryzen 9 8945HX CPU at 100W while that GPU stays at 145W. You also get not one but <em>two</em> M.2 2280 slots for NVMe SSD storage, two SO-DIMM slots for up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM, and <em>five</em> display outputs (2x DP2.1, 1x DP 1.4, and 2x HDMI 2.1) for up to four displays at once.</p><p>It’s on sale now with 32GB and 1TB for $1,440, shipping mid January — which is honestly starting to look like a decent deal now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">RAM prices are out of control.</a> There’s also a bring-your-own-RAM-and-storage barebones version for $1,040, though it’s not available to order yet.</p><p>Valve still isn’t talking price yet, but I’d hope it’s more affordable than this one. Even so, Valve says it put a lot of work into cooling, noise, and wireless connectivity, and Linux drivers are still more mature on the AMD GPU side of things if you’re <a href="http://Tempted to try installing Bazzite on this thing!">considering a Bazzite</a> or SteamOS install. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828620/linux-benchmarks-bazzite-gamersnexus">GamersNexus’ new video</a> does include Linux benchmarks for desktop RTX 5060, maybe check those out?</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/831106/minisforum-g1-pro-mini-pc-price-release-date]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-dualsense-edge-controller-pro-gamers-can-snag-it-at-all-time-low-2000647737</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Casual gamers find complete satisfaction with standard <em>DualSense</em> controllers (currently hitting record-low prices during Black Friday on Amazon) which deliver good value for typical gaming needs. Dedicated players pursuing competitive advantages against skilled opponents require the enhanced customization that separates good performance from elite execution.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">At $169, down from $199, the DualSense Edge costs approximately three times more</a> than standard controllers but provides <strong>true personalization capabilities that genuinely elevate gameplay for serious PS5 fans</strong> facing competition online. This record-low Black Friday price on Amazon represents unprecedented savings that didn’t materialize during either of the past two Prime Day events.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adjustable Triggers That Match Your Playstyle</h2>
<p>The <strong>ability to customize the trigger travel distance</strong> means you can configure the distance you need to pull the L2 and R2 triggers before reaching the maximum activation, resulting in dramatic effects on shooting games where milliseconds make the difference between winning and losing. Using short triggers means you can minimize the travel range which results in distances activated the moment they make contact, similar to the effect of using a mouse on ultra-fast shooting in Call of Duty and other shooting games like Apex Legends. Medium triggers offer optimal performance on shooting games that use reaction and accuracy while long triggers offer the same experience on racing games.</p>
<p>The i<strong>nterchangeable stick caps are available in three variations</strong>, namely standard, high dome and low dome, each impacting the touch and leverage on the sticks according to the type of games you play. The high dome stickcaps allow you optimal leverage when aiming in first-person shooting games, where the slightest misaim could mean the difference between a hit and a miss. The low dome stickcaps, on the other hand, allow gamers quick turns when engaging in fighting and sports video games where the sticks need rapid turns.</p>



<p>The use of the <strong>back buttons enables the inclusion of two programmable paddles</strong> that can be accessed with the middle fingers without compromising the hold on the sticks, hence the functionality of the buttons. The use of the back buttons also enables the execution of bunny hops and the ability to execute a drop shot with the ability to accurately aim, an ability that differentiates professional play from normal play.</p>
<p><strong>Dead-zone customization</strong> corresponds to the length the sticks need to travel in order to register an input, mitigating the issue of the sticks drifting over time. A small dead-zone setting provides the greatest responsiveness when using precise inputs, and large dead zones prevent unintended movement when the sticks are loose. The curve settings correspond to the stick movement and in-game sensitivit, and exponential and linear settings offer dramatic changes in aiming.</p>



<p>The<strong> carrying case provides protection for the controller when transported</strong> in addition to the organization it provides for the stick caps, the back button, and the USB cord. The braided USB-C cord ensures a seamless connection, eliminating the latency that comes with wireless play, making it ideal in the world of competitive gaming where milliseconds matter.</p>
<p><strong>Profile switching provides the ability to store numerous full configurations</strong> on the controller, all activated at the touch of a controller button, even when the apps on the watch are locked.</p>
<p>At $169, the <strong>PlayStation DualSense Edge</strong> delivers adjustable triggers, interchangeable stick caps, programmable back buttons, dead zone customization and replaceable stick modules at 15% below retail this Black Friday. The premium over standard DualSense justifies itself through customization that improves competitive performance rather than just adding luxury features.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Is For Products, Not Art]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/</link>
            <guid>1366003</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This week Santa Ragione – the Italian indie studio behind award-winning games like <em>Wheels of Aurelia</em>, <em>Saturnalia</em>, and <em>Mediterranea </em>– made the shocking announcement that it is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam?ref=aftermath.site"><u>likely not long for this world</u></a> after Steam blocked the release of its upcoming horror game about “power, faith, and violence,” <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Horses</u></em></a>. The situation is complicated, involving a scene meant to unsettle and push boundaries. But this is the case with many pieces of art. Steam, however, has shown <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>time and time again</u></a> that its standardized approach to game approval leaves little room for gray areas.</p><p><em>Horses</em>, <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to Santa Ragione</u></a>, originally included a scene that Valve construed as depicting “sexual conduct involving a minor.” While Valve did not provide exact details when it first reviewed an early version of the game back in 2023, Santa Ragione suspects that the Steam steward took issue with a moment in which a man and his daughter visit a farm where the titular horses are people.</p><p>“The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the ‘horses’ are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one,” <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reads an FAQ</u></a> about the situation from Santa Ragione. “What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag.”</p><p>The studio goes on to say, however, that it has since changed the character in the scene to be a 20-something woman, “both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of <em>Horses</em>, works much better when delivered by an older character.”</p><p>Valve has evidently not been moved by this change.</p><p>"We reviewed the game back in 2023,” a Valve spokesperson said this week in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/horror-game-maker-accuses-valve-of-censorship-after-its-game-about-nude-human-horses-is-rejected-by-steam-lawful-works-should-not-be-made-unreachable-by-a-monopolistic-storefronts-opaque-decisions/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement to PC Gamer</u></a>. “At that time, the developer indicated with their release date in Steamworks that they planned to release a few months later. Based on content in the store page, we told the developer we would need to review the build itself. This happens sometimes if content on the store page causes concern that the game itself might not fall within our guidelines. After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam."</p><p>It’s important to note that all of this took place prior to the recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal/"><u>payment processor-prompted crackdown on NSFW content</u></a> that’s rocked Steam and Itch. Since then, Valve’s standards have only grown stricter, with the company <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>removing dozens of games earlier this year</u></a> in tandem with the addition of a new, frustratingly vague rule forbidding content that “may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers.”&nbsp;</p><p>A store like Steam cannot operate without the participation of credit card companies and payment processors, so this leaves Valve in something of a pickle. But where Itch at least attempted to communicate to developers what was happening and <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal/"><u>stated an intention to</u></a> “start working with more financial partners that are equipped to handle the kind of content we have,” Valve did as it always has: communicated minimally and vaguely and then moved on.</p><p>In its FAQ, Santa Ragione said that it feels more like Valve is making a “policy decision” than one about whether or not content in the game is actually legal, which gets to the heart of what Steam is: An algorithmically-powered machine where even the final few vestiges of human decisionmaking must adhere to robotically rigid strictures. This is to some degree a problem of scale; with tens of thousands of games releasing per year, providing everyone with individualized case-by-case attention is nearly impossible (though if anyone’s making enough money to do so anyway, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/estimates-peg-valve-as-a-capitalism-fusion-reactor-making-such-ungodly-money-per-employee-that-its-no-wonder-gabe-newell-bought-all-those-yachts-and-the-whole-damn-yacht-company/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>it’s Valve</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>But Valve is effectively creating its own laws, because Steam is no longer a market in the traditional sense, where buyers and sellers – in other words, regular people – would ultimately decide what’s acceptable. It is, as author, politician, and former Valve economist in residence Yanis Varoufakis <a href="https://aftermath.site/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-valve-steam-interview/"><u>told Aftermath last year</u></a>, a technofeudalist megastructure, a plot of land on which developers work and toil while Valve extracts rent:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>It looks like a marketplace, but it isn't a marketplace. It has none of the characteristics of a market. And the most important characteristic of a market is its decentralization. You walk into a shopping mall, you walk into a farmer's market, if you and I walk together, we see the same products. We can have a discussion about it. We can say 'Ah, this is crap,' that we're not gonna buy the stuff, or 'This looks great.' We can't do that on Amazon.com because you and I cannot communicate. The algorithm doesn't allow us. It matches you with a particular vendor, maximizing the likelihood of extracting a greater cloud rent from the vendor. And if you and I type the same thing in the search box, we get very different recommendations, because that's how the statistical model works. This is how the algorithm works.</blockquote><p>Reviews, forums, and curators might present the illusion of such communication, but Valve has final say 100 percent of the time. It does not want to <em>appear </em>to be making decisions, though, which is why it shrouds the whole process in vague policyspeak. But no matter how much Valve removes human intentionality from the forefront of its operation, it is making a clear statement about what it – and nobody else – deems acceptable.</p><p>"Steam publicly downplays human curation in favor of algorithmic sales optimization, yet intervenes with censorship when a game’s artistic vision does not align with what the platform owners considers acceptable art," Santa Ragione wrote in its FAQ. "Steam’s behavior passively shapes which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship. ... Mature works with comparable or stronger themes routinely appear on mainstream streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, where controversial directors are an accepted part of the catalog. This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film, and intervenes with censorship when an artistic vision does not align with what the platform owner considers acceptable art."</p><p>Steam is a relentlessly well-oiled machine optimized for the purpose of pushing products –&nbsp; games that adhere to well-worn themes, structures, and strictures. It recommends games along genre lines; it tries to algorithmically match you with games similar to what you last played at every turn. It is deeply traditional – conservative, even – in its construction. Sometimes art that seeks to provoke or unsettle gets through, but this is closer to a happy accident than the purpose of Steam’s design. Valve has built a machine that cannot challenge the status quo, where rare human decisions must reinforce that ethos to avoid upsetting the immensely profitable apple cart.&nbsp;</p><p>This should no longer surprise us; Valve drew its line in the sand years ago. But it’s important to remember where the company and the people running it stand – and to recognize that their decisions reverberate through the industry, deciding what does and does not constitute commercially viable art. Such a lofty position necessarily confers responsibility, but Valve refuses to accept it, and I do not imagine it will change its mind anytime soon. This is not to say the larger game development community should take pressure off Valve, but it’s also time to consider alternatives, to build spaces for and unabashedly by human beings. I know it’s far easier said than done, especially when you’ve still got to put food on the table, but what other choice is there?&nbsp;</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-valve-steam-interview/"><div><p>Yanis Varoufakis Thinks Capitalism Has Been Killed By Technofeudalism, Something He Helped Usher In At Valve - Aftermath</p><p>“This is not sustainable”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

On Wednesday, CyberPowerPC <a href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993126805658911041?s=20">announced that it plans</a> to adjust the pricing across all of its systems on December 7th, as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/cyberpowerpc-is-latest-system-builder-to-hike-prices-over-soaring-dram">reported earlier by <em>PCMag</em></a>.</p><p>“Recently, global memory (RAM) prices have surged by 500% and SSD prices have risen by 100%,” CyberPowerPC says in a statement posted on X. “This has had a direct impact on the cost of building gaming PCs since 10/1/25.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Maingear is trying to stave off price increases for as long as it can. “I anticipate that the prices will continue to rise and then we will eventually have to increase our lead times as stock and allocation becomes constrained, but we are in constant communication with our vendors and will delay these increases for as long as we possibly can,” Maingear CEO Wallace Santos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-wait-on-pc-upgrades-as-maingear-ceo-warns-memory-shortages-will-deepen/">tells <em>Wccftech</em></a>.</p><p>The price of RAM has fluctuated greatly over the past month as AI companies buy up more RAM and data storage for their sprawling data centers. Some physical stores have resorted to pricing the components at market prices, not unlike how seafood restaurants sell the catch-of-the-day. <a href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993431465150046577?s=20">CyberPowerPC </a>predicts that the “price increases will be temporary,” and will go back down “when market conditions change.”</p><p>Maingear CEO Wallace Santos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-wait-on-pc-upgrades-as-maingear-ceo-warns-memory-shortages-will-deepen/">tells <em>Wccftech</em></a> that customers might want to start “shopping now” if they need a memory or storage upgrade. Though this may seem like another way to boost sales for Black Friday, Santos appears to be genuinely warning of an increased shortage, and says the PCs he’s selling this Black Friday have been “sheltered from these price increases.”</p><p>Skytech Gaming, another company that specializes in prebuilt and custom PCs, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialskytechgaming">said in a post on Facebook</a> that it’s “getting hit with RAM price increases too,” though it’s unclear whether these changes are impacting the prices listed on its website yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/831032/cyberpowerpc-maingear-ram-price-increases-pc-gaming]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>… in space! That is what Young Suns, the latest game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/goodbye-volcano-high">Goodbye Volcano High</a>, Depanneur <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturne">Nocturne</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gnog">GNOG</a> developer KO_OP Mode, appears to be when put reductively. But let's not put it reductively, because while this is one of those cozy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">life-sims</a>, it does sound like it has something going on for it, particularly for the more revolutionary of you out there.
</p>
<p>
Young Suns is set right after a revolution has taken place on Jupiter, obviously far off in the future because I don't even know if you can actually stand on the orb famously known as the gas giant. Anyway, post-revolution, there is work to be done in order to make it a better place. So, you get given a ship, tasked with heading out to other planetoids, ruins, and stations, either by yourself or with up to three friends.

<p>
The Animal Crossingness of it all manifests in the ability to customize how your character, spaceship, and living quarters looks, with a lot of the UI and UX reminding me of the most recent entry, New Horizons, in particular. There's a very neat-looking character creator too, with options for things like prosthetic limbs and even being fat - as a bigger person myself, it's one of those forgotten aspects that I greatly appreciate, so kudos for highlighting it with a dedicated tummy slider section in the trailer. 
</p><p>
However, while Animal Crossing has its own cast of characters with stories happening in the background, narrative is brought to the foreground in Young Suns. There's a whole bunch of characters to interact with, 30 of 'em apparently, each with "unique looks, behaviors and over 2 months of unique daily chats."
</p>
<p>
The thing that I personally need Young Suns to deliver on is its understanding of the inherent flaws in the genre. Animal Crossing started out as a simple little game where you lived in a town where your neighbours kind of hate you (but in a funny way), and now it has morphed into a game where you must mine the resources of every single resource you come across in order to build and shape the land as you see fit.
</p>
<p>
It's a bit yucky, and I did notice in the trailer that there is some resource mining to be found in Young Suns too. What is a revolution good for if we uphold the systems that oppressed us? Guess I'll find out how KO_OP handle things whenever the game launches on Steam - you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4149610/Young_Suns/">here</a> in the meantime.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-sales-witcher-4-cdpr-2000647747</link>
            <guid>1365976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is keeping the lights on CD Projekt Red. The Polish studio confirmed the 2020 RPG is now its main source of revenue as the rags-to-riches blockbuster reaches 35 million sales before <em>The Witcher 3</em> did.</p> <p>CDPR revealed the new milestone in its latest earnings report. “That’s a better result than<em> The Witcher 3</em> was able to achieve in the same post-release time frame,” CFO Piotr Nielubowicz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ENiOGmcic">said</a>. That make it now the company’s “main source of income” as it staffs up on<a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198"><em> Cyberpunk 2</em></a>, whose development is split between teams in Warsaw and Boston.</p> <p>While about half of the company remains focused on shipping <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR plans to have over 300 developers working on the sci-fi sequel by the end of 2027, suggesting that year will mark an inflexion point as the studio pivots to the full production on the latter. At least if everything goes according to plan.</p>

 <p>While Cyberpunk is still almost half short of The Witcher 3’s 60 million all-time sales, its new record is impressive for a game whose launch was one of the most high-profile disasters in recent gaming history. Despite praise for the PC version, the console port, especially on last-gen consoles, led to viral bug montages, fan revolts, and investor freakouts.</p>

 <p>It’s not every day a game that was once pulled off of PSN by Sony becomes a company’s main cash cow. Much of that turnaround is owed to a series of massive patches and 2023’s fantastic <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291"><em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion</a>.</p> <p>It’s no doubt also helped by a great Switch 2 port that arrived back in June. The five-year-old game runs great on Nintendo’s new hardware and gives millions of new players a chance to experience V’s tour through heaven and hell in Night City for them selves. Or anyone who played it years ago but still needs to go back and get the good ending. Thanks god for cross-save!</p>

The media <a href="https://www.polygon.com/microsoft-xbox-steam-machine-analysis/" rel="nofollow ">chimed in too</a>, opining about the timeliness of its return and whether or not it has the chance to significantly dent the crowded market it's entering into.</p><p dir="ltr">But I don't think the Steam Machine really needs to "fight" in the traditional sense to be competitive. That's because I don't believe it actually has to do anything in order to chip away at the already-crumbling console infrastructure to win hearts and minds. It just has to be there.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Steam Hardware Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The console market is arguably in the best place it's ever going to be for a large shakeup. Nintendo is, as always, doing its own thing with the Switch 2, which has proven itself to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weve-never-seen-anything-like-switch-2s-sales-before/1100-6536384/">phenomenon beyond </a>what we've seen before, and capable of filling the first Switch's intimidatingly large shoes and serving Nintendo's large niche.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the PlayStation 5 has emerged victorious over the Xbox Series X|S, though I'd argue it has failed to leverage that momentum and made itself gaming's premiere hub in large part due to strategic shifts that have complicated matters and muddied the waters. Notably, PlayStation's gambit to invest in live-service titles this console generation hasn't panned out and brought in players outside of its existing ecosystem all that much. At the end of the day, the most exciting prospects in games aren't emerging from PlayStation's camp.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite its missteps, PlayStation has dwarfed Xbox in terms of sales. That reality feels like it has more to do with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-an-increasingly-unstable-platform-for-anyone-to-invest-in/1100-6533717/">Microsoft's instability</a> and lack of concrete direction for its gaming division than PlayStation's own merits and successes.</p><p dir="ltr">In the case of PlayStation and Xbox, both have also increasingly ceded territory to PC gaming in the past several years. While it's a little slow to the process, Sony has ported most of its output this console generation over to PC storefronts. Since the very beginning of the generation, Xbox has been loud about its courtship of PC players, simultaneously launching marquee titles on both Xbox and PC in order to have a more pronounced position in the realm of PC gaming. Lately, the "This is an Xbox" campaign out of Microsoft has emphasized how little sense it makes to pick up one of its consoles over a PC or a Fire Stick, which isn't exactly a great selling point for Xbox consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">As you're hopefully beginning to see, the console space is remarkably weak right now--that's without accounting for the state of U.S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/">tariffs</a>, which are likely to impact Steam Machine pricing but won't surprise its adopters like it did when existing console manufacturers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">increased</a> console prices in response. In an ecosystem largely driven by exclusivity, PC is also quietly the king, which seems like a major boon in the Steam Machine's favor. With the Steam Machine positioned as its console-like companion and access to much of PC gaming's sizable library, I think the console market has something to be fearful of here.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because a number of this year's biggest success stories are still exclusive to PC. Last we heard, Landfall Games and Aggro Crab's Peak, a multiplayer game about climbing a mountain in often comic situations, had sold north of 10 million copies by August of 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/repo/">REPO</a>, a survival horror game with proximity chat, launched into early access this past February and still maintains concurrents in the six-digits. And though its numbers have since dwindled, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/">Schedule I</a> became the game du jour for a hot second on PC, reaching an all-time peak of nearly 460,000 concurrent players. Outside of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> and continued successes like Fortnite and Roblox, the trend of games achieving viral-levels of success and explosive growth in 2025 has been concentrated on PC exclusives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4612753-4519124-peak_keyart_no_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612753" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4612753-4519124-peak_keyart_no_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612753"></a><figcaption>A look at climbing game Peak.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4612753-4519124-peak_keyart_no_logo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Steam Machine now promises to bring these titles to console players right out of the box. This audience is occasionally starved for the kinds of tentpole games that justify a console purchase--consider how long it now takes a AAA developer like Naughty Dog to make just one title. The Steam Machine holds a tantalizing potential previously unavailable to console players: the ability to play more of the biggest success stories in gaming that happen each and every year.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's the Steam Machine's other uses. While it's certainly a gaming PC disguised as a console first and foremost, it's also, as Valve has clarified, literally a PC too. SteamOS, which has been fine tuned for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/">Steam Deck</a>, has proven its reliability, but Valve has made no secret of the Machine's malleability either. Though I'm sure Valve would love for adopters of the Steam Machine to stick with SteamOS, it isn't locked into one operating system like a console would be. In fact, Valve happily touts the fact that the Steam Machine can support other operating systems and functions if the user wants on the system's own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" rel="nofollow ">landing page</a>!</p><p dir="ltr">At a time where customers are <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/aaa-games-like-the-usd70-ghost-of-yotei-are-really-just-for-more-affluent-people-says-analyst-as-soaring-prices-push-players-toward-free-games-and-fortnite-people-just-dont-realize-because-theyre-not-paying-attention/" rel="nofollow ">becoming cagier</a> about where they spend their hard-earned money, a system--one which can double as a home computer and console, too--tapped into Steam's vast library sounds like a much better use of time, energy, and cash than investing in several different consoles. To Valve's benefit, the math is indubitably on its side the second the Steam Machine hits the market.</p><p dir="ltr">The Steam Machine may prove popular via another avenue: price. A gaming PC is a luxury expense. It's always been expensive, at times prohibitively so, and that's not changed for the better in the last decade. And while Valve doesn't seem likely to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-price-valve-may-have-just-given-the-best-clue-yet/1100-6536462/">subsidize the Steam Machine</a>, it could prove to be unmistakably game-changing for console players currently spreading their money across multiple consoles, handhelds, a computer, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't love ponying up the grand it took to build my gaming PC, but it turns out that consolidating all the use cases I could have for such a piece of hardware--gaming, working, socializing, browsing and consuming media--and paying a premium for it saved me needing to own anything else. Now, I'm completely alienated from most of my gaming systems. Of them all, my Switch 2 gets the most regular play. Otherwise, my PS5 is a glorified cable box. And my Xbox? Well, I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I booted up my dust-covered Xbox Series X, which is baffling considering it is where I've spent the most time and money since 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">My PC is my new base of operations, and despite its relatively exorbitant cost, it's been worth the price of admission. I suspect many are looking ahead to the next generation of consoles, doing the math, and coming to the same conclusion: buying one Steam console that can play PC, PlayStation, and Xbox games is likely a more sound investment than buying up every alternative on the market.</p><p dir="ltr">Just earlier this month, Strauss Zelnick, head of Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" rel="nofollow ">told CNBC</a> that he thought the industry was trending in the direction of PCs rather than consoles. After a decade of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-an-absolutely-absurd-amount-of-copies-in-the-last-three-months/1100-6531582/">continued post-launch support and growth--</a>including sustained popularity on PC thanks in part to mods that have turned Grand Theft Auto 5 into a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/gta-online-roleplay-has-kept-game-alive-until-gta-vi-1235326435/" rel="nofollow ">roleplaying simulation</a> among other things--I'm inclined to agree. For better and for worse, gaming's future does in fact appear to lie in, maybe even rely upon, a major shift to PC over consoles.</p><p>The Steam Machine is well-positioned to capitalize on that shift and further gaming's increasing dependency upon Valve--a prospect fraught with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">its own perils</a>--without breaking a sweat. I don't believe the Steam Machine will immediately light up the charts or have PlayStation shaking in its boots upon launch, but it shouldn't be taken lightly either. No, I suspect it'll be much more of a silent killer, and if any one company has the ability to play the long game here and slowly but surely make a sizable dent in the console market, it's Valve.</p>

    <article>
      <p>In September 2025 Splash Damage, who have been either making or helping make some of the best shooters of the last 20 years,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-breaks-away-from-tencent?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>was bought by a private equity firm</u></a>. That was just <em>two months ago</em>. Today, the company announced that layoffs are coming.</p><p>In a statement published on social media, Splash Damage's statement reads:</p><blockquote>Today we announced to our teams that we are entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles. This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">This "consultation process" is part of British law</a>, and basically means that layoffs are coming; while we don't know exactly how many, the words "studio-wide" and "affecting all roles" certainly suggests there are going to be more than a few workers impacted.</p><p>Having assisted Microsoft on a number of high-profile shooters through the 2010s, from <em>Gears of War</em> to <em>Halo's Master Chief Collection</em>, Splash Damage was bought by Tencent in 2020. A major project they'd been working on for a number of years, <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, was cancelled at the beginning of 2025, resulting in a wave of layoffs. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xt3s-UE7mDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Transformers Reactivate - World Premiere Trailer | The Game Awards 2022"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Transformers Reactivate was first shown off at The Game Awards in 2022, before being officially cancelled in January 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The studio's new owners--who have only been named as "private equity investors"--clearly have no interest in Splash Damage's history or experience, and have instead wasted absolutely no time doing what they do best: buying storied old companies and gutting them to the bone, before throwing those bones into the trash and moving onto the next victim. </p><p>I'm sure some asshole in an expensive suit would argue that as of November 2025 Splash Damage's recent track record and the current volatility affecting the video game market make them a prime target for layoffs and maybe even closure. I would argue that anyone looking at a spreadsheet featuring the last three month's financials, and not the wider picture that this is a studio full of experienced developers who know how to make good video games, should be thrown into the deepest part of the ocean. </p>

              <p>Don’t worry, guys, that viral video featuring a fake <em>GTA 6</em> leak that was swiftly identified as AI was all a social experiment! Doesn’t that automatically make the continued, extreme blurring between reality and AI-generated junk a bit better, because in this case, it was done to prove a point? No? Dang.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-leak-fake-ai-youtube-google-2000647395">Yesterday, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s Ethan Gach opined on</a> how the demand for news about Rockstar’s long-awaited, repeatedly delayed game, coupled with the increasing ease with which your neighbor Bob can “create” pictures and videos with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, has made for a fake footage nightmare.</p>

 <p>On November 25, a verified Twitter/X account named <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/">ZapActu GTA6</a> issued an “EXTREMELY SERIOUS SITUATION” alert on the platform and shared allegedly leaked footage that appeared to show <em>GTA 6</em> protagonist Lucia walking around in the upcoming game’s open world. The video, reportedly first shared on TikTok, showed off a “dynamic weather system unlike anything seen in&nbsp;<em>GTA V”&nbsp;</em>and “shockingly lifelike NPCs” and a “level of realism” that was quite frankly astounding because it was all fake. The post sharing the video has since been deleted.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-creator-of-viral-gta-6-gameplay-leak-video-insists-it-was-an-experiment-designed-to-show-how-easy-it-has-become-to-blur-the-line-between-reality-and-ai-generated-content"><em>IGN</em> reports</a> that Zap Actu GTA6’s Discord was buzzing with backlash after the fake footage leak, prompting them to issue a statement. They claimed the AI-generated <em>GTA 6</em> videos were created “to observe people’s reactions and to demonstrate how easy it has become in 2025 to blur the line between reality and AI-generated content.” They also said there were no “bad intentions” when they created and shared the fake videos.</p>

 <blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">My intention was never to harm anyone. I simply wanted to create something intriguing that could bring people together and spark discussion within the GTA 6 community. I genuinely never expected a single video to generate such massive engagement and reach.</p> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In a much less apologetic message to <em>IGN</em>, Zap Actu said,&nbsp;“It was a huge joke actually, I did it just to entertain the community. Sorry for the false hope lol.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The “I was doing the bad thing to shine light on the bad thing” excuse is one human beings have been using for years (and the same one I used when my parents found a box of candy wrappers under my bed a week before Halloween 1999). It’s hard to believe someone who has dedicated a huge chunk of their internet presence to monitoring <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> news would have “never expected a single video to generate such massive engagement and reach,” especially considering the lack of concrete&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>news over the last decade.</p>

 <p data-cy="paragraph">Though Zap Actu claims they made no money from sharing the fake&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em> leaks, they do have an active “X Premium” account. Those who subscribe to the X Premium get a blue check next to their name and are eligible for monetization if they have at least 500 verified followers (Zap Actu has over 4,000, though it’s unclear how many are verified), have at least 5 million organic impressions in the last three months, and are in a supported country (Zap Actu’s account states it’s based in France).</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, as more and more AI content gets heaped onto the mostly unregulated slop pile that is Twitter, we should expect to encounter more fake <em>GTA 6</em> content that can easily pass as real. What a reality we live in!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Has Explained Why Scrappy The Rooster Exists in ARC Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scrappy-embark-arc-raiders-back-story/</link>
            <guid>1365919</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone who has played ARC Raiders knows that Scrappy the Rooster exists. He’s a quirky little bird that struts around your Raider Den, collecting all kinds of resources while you’re off topside fighting the ARC – and other Raiders. But nobody really knows how he got there and what his purpose in life is, besides gathering scrap items.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has just set the story straight on where Scrappy came from and why he exists in ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-scrappy-has-an-origin-story">Scrappy Has an Origin Story</h2>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-story-of-scrappy-the-rooster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders website</a>, Johan, a 3D artist working on the game, revealed the origin story behind Scrappy, everyone’s favorite and lovable rooster character:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was living with my parents at the time – they happened to keep chickens. Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was Hȧkan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p>



<p><strong>Hȧkan was unlike the other roosters.</strong>&nbsp;Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, I decided to photoscan Håkan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of Hȧkan sprinting around the cantina.</p>



<p><strong>But then, Hȧkan</strong>&nbsp;<strong>got his chance to shine.&nbsp;</strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a “resource producer,” something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats… robot-cats! But the art team didn’t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, “don’t we have a rooster?”</p>



<p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon.&nbsp;</strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to “temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later”, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a quaint story, but it perfectly explains why Scrappy exists in a world so devoid of animal life. Most of the humour has been sucked clean out of the world on account of it being a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but knowing that Scrappy is waiting for you when you return to Speranza is always a nice touch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Since Fortnite launched in 2017, it has had some downright insane collaborations. The latest one is due to arrive this coming Sunday, November 30, 2025, with the previously unreleased Kill Bill chapter, Yuki's Revenge, coming to Fortnite as part of the Quentin Tarantino collaboration.</p>



<p>Epic Games put out a new teaser trailer for the collaboration today, giving us our first look at the chapter that never made it to the silver screen, but will now see the light of day more than 20 years after the release of Kill Bill Vol. 2.</p>



<p>Fortnite has been a part of several 'firsts' for video games, and this has to be a new one, as it's currently difficult to recall another time when a previously unreleased chapter of a popular film was showcased for the first time as part of a popular video game, instead of, say, a movie theatre.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7h1aMVdBEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, the short will be shown in theatres, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/yukis-revenge-premieres-in-fortnite-on-november-30?lang=en-US">according to a blog post on the Fortnite website</a>. "<em>Starting December 5, participating theaters in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom will show Yuki’s Revenge as part of an exclusive limited theatrical run of </em><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em>," the blog post reads.</p>



<p>US players who purchase a ticket to go see the short in theatres between November 20 and November 29 will also receive a code for the in-game Gogo Yubari outfit at participating theatres. </p>



<p>This weekend in Fortnite also marks the end of Chapter Six and the beginning of Chapter Seven, with Zero Hour kicking off this coming Saturday, November 29, 2025.</p>

            <p>
It is not exactly a secret that, in recent years, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> hasn't been doing so hot. Frequenters of the pseudo-MMO have found certain expansions and updates to be disappointing, and for a live service game a few too many disappointments can be devastating. Now, in a new interview, the game's director Tyson Green has acknowledged how the game is struggling to bring in a new audience, and discussed the difficulties that come with that.
</p>
<p>
"For years now, Destiny has been on this steady hardening of the core [audience]," Green said, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future">IGN</a>. "More and more core players are staying and playing the game, but relatively few [new] people come into the game. There's a tightening and contraction, and this presents problems for a game that you're trying to maintain as a live service, especially when you want to keep serving those core players with great, compelling expansions."
</p>
<p>
Part of the issue, Green thinks, is that Destiny 2's expansion The Final Shape, which essentially wrapped up the main story Bungie had been working on nigh on a decade. They found that those that played it felt satisfied, but "the big [downwards] spike in population [came after]. That happened because we ended the saga. So you get what you pay for, right?"
</p>
<p>
Of course, as Green notes, from a business perspective this isn't what they had planned, and he noted that they wanted to and want to keep working within the world of Destiny. "There are still lots of things to do, and we have to keep building the game. Unfortunately, it was not gracefully managed, but we had to try something."
</p><p>
That something is the game's new Fate saga, the latest addition of that being the Star Wars themed Renegades. I'm not a Destiny person myself, and I can tell you personally that has someone who has floated the idea of picking the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> up, Star Wars does nothing for me (I think brand crossovers are the devil's work, particularly in narrative-driven live service games), and just how much of the story is vaulted away makes it feel not particularly worth it either.
</p><p>

Perhaps slightly soberingly, Green also said that he thinks Bungie have "been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: those that listen to the players and respond, and those that don't. And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny."

</p><p>
There are whispers from a source whose reputability I can't quite determine, so take this with the tiniest pinches of salt, <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752">that Destiny 3 is in the works</a>, but I am wondering if this isn't the trump card Bungie may want it to be. And with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">Marathon as it is</a>, well, Bungie can't really afford to make any mistakes.

<p>It was a mixed season last year for these players, but perhaps none more so than Neptune, a superstar player who broke back into the CDL under the Vancouver Surge banner, going on to land in second place at multiple Major tournaments <strong>and </strong>at COD Champs. It was <strong>almost </strong>Neptune’s greatest season ever.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ghosty and Envoy migrate from LA Thieves, their spots overtaken by a restructuring that has finally pulled aBeZy out from under the FaZe banner.</p>



<p>LAT won Major 3 and Major 4 and went on to top the chart by the end of the season, but a hugely lacklustre performance in Kitchener at COD Champs saw the team drop out in seventh place after being defeated by Boston Breach <strong>and </strong>Vancouver Surge. There’s likely very little love lost between Envoy, Ghosty, and Neptune.</p>



<p>Sib comes over from Cloud9 NY, a rehash of the old New York Subliners roster that was also taken over last season. It was a horrible year for C9NY, with the team failing to secure a spot of traction the whole season through, falling extremely short and not even making it to Champs.</p>



<p>Ironically, C9NY <strong>still </strong>finished above LAG M8 in the season standings.</p>



<p>It’s going to be a busy year in the Call of Duty League. Let me know what roster you’re most interested in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Fans Just Made Magic: The Gathering Do Something Unprecedented]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-mtg-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-superdrop-2000647703</link>
            <guid>1365883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s Secret Lair x <em>Monster Hunter</em> drop was revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251121083502/https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-monster-hunter-superdrop">just last week</a>. It featured a number of characters and creatures from the hit Capcom multiplayer series and a Sol Ring promo card in each drop. But fans were not impressed. The card selection for the reprints was criticized for being uninspired and having nothing to do with the series it was drawing from. In fact, the fan reaction was so loud <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">that Wizards of the Coast</a> has done something completely unexpected: take the Secret Lair drop back to the drawing board.</p> <p>“We heard loud and clear that you were disappointed, and we believe we can do better,” the company <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter">announced on Wednesday</a>. “We’re going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.” Wizards admitted it “missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of <em>Monster Hunter</em> and plans to rework the Superdrop in the meantime. Details on the new set won’t be re-revealed until next year.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We care a lot about the worlds we get to celebrate, and Secret Lair x Monster Hunter didn’t quite come together the way it should have. We hear you, so we’re heading back to the drawing board to rework this Superdrop. More to come.<a href="https://t.co/dtHublSB13">https://t.co/dtHublSB13</a> <a href="https://t.co/yMkaUPaUWI">pic.twitter.com/yMkaUPaUWI</a></p> <p>— MTG Secret Lair (@MTGSecretLair) <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1993726445193990451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Players had three main complaints about the Secret Lair x Monster Hunter collaboration. The first was that the card selection was pretty bland and not aligned with the series’ lore. Valstrax, the silver Elder Dragon, was <a href="https://x.com/TheTrinketMage/status/1990867324048421298">a Sol Ring</a>&nbsp;despite being neither an artifact nor a ring. Some took issue with the color selection for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1p0lerg/official_magic_the_gathering_x_monster_hunter/">various references</a>, as well as the card art.</p>

 <p>The general bewilderment was best encapsulated by the Champion of Kotoko card, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1p0i9dq/monster_hunter_secret_lair_champion_of_kotoko/">misspelled Kokoto</a>, the village from the very first Monster Hunter game. It didn’t help that many of the reprinted cards had a second-hand market value well below the $30 and $40 Superdrops.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Upon further inspection some of the Monster Hunter x Magic The Gathering cards don't look too good</p> <p>Velkhana and Malzeno especially look a bit weird, like they had their face smoothed.</p> <p>Yuan Garuga also looks goofy and then there's Champion Of "Kotoko" <a href="https://t.co/bbyOFVHpUG">pic.twitter.com/bbyOFVHpUG</a></p> <p>— DarkHero (@DarkHeroCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkHeroCC/status/1991154721541722419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One MTG YouTuber summed up the response with a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NASy37-CGaE">The <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair Sucks</a>.”</p> <p>Now that Wizards is redoing the set from scratch, some fans are hopeful it might just go the route of making completely unique cards rather than picking other card reprints to tag with new<em> Monster Hunter</em> names and art. Or Wizards could bring back the “craft” mechanic from<em> Lost Caverns of Ixalan,</em> given <em>MonHon</em>‘s emphasis on creatures and equipment. There have also been requests for Capcom’s own artists to contribute to the illustrations.</p> <p>Whatever the revised Secret Lair Superdrop ends up being, Wizards says not to get used to this sort of reversal. “Pulling Superdrops back isn’t something we’re going to do very often, but we’re committed to doing better,” the company wrote today. “Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.”</p>
