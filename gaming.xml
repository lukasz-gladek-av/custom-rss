            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167893/sony-days-of-play-sale-2024-ps5-slim-digital-edition-psvr-2-games-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony’s recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168001/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-silent-hill">State of Play showcase</a> may have given us a brief glimpse into the company’s plans for 2024 and beyond, but that probably does little if you were hoping for something you can play right now. That’s where the Days of Play sale comes in. Now through June 12th, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/">Sony is discounting dozens of PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 titles</a>, as well as accompanying <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#consoles">hardware</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#accessories">accessories</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus/#subscriptions">subscriptions</a>.</p></div><p>First things first, if you’re still looking to pick up a PS5 console, you can save $50 on the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition</strong>, which are available for as low as $449 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrW9iY3e3">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>) and $399 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrWxZIomR">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>), respectively. These match the lowest prices we’ve seen on the newer PS5 models, which are slightly slimmer than Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">original PS5 console</a>. They also sport two front-facing USB-C ports and an expanded 1TB of built-in storage (up from 825GB), though keep in mind that only the disc-based version can play physical games and other Ultra HD Blu-ray discs.&nbsp;</p><p>As an added bonus, PlayStation Plus members who buy directly from PlayStation will receive 12 months of Netflix Premium, the streaming service’s most expensive tier. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">Read our hands-on impressions of the PS5 “slim.”</a></h5></p><div><p>Sony’s new standard PlayStation 5 includes a removable disc drive, dual front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and a slightly smaller and lighter design.</p></div><div><p>The PlayStation 5 Digital doesn’t come with a disc drive, but you can buy one separately if you later decide you want one. The console otherwise plays all of the same games as the version equipped with a disc drive.</p></div><p>Elsewhere on the hardware front, the <strong>PSVR 2</strong> is on sale starting at $449 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmonR1hkAm">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. That’s the best price we’ve seen on the virtual reality headset, which, sadly, often costs more than the PS5 that’s required to play it.</p><p>The PSVR 2’s price reflects its underrealized potential. Its launch library wasn’t the greatest, but it’s slowly and steadily building its catalog with a diverse selection of made-for-VR titles. This includes <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA09555_00-HZVRCALLMOUNTAIN"><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em></a>, which you can currently purchase from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmNa6JwUFh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle">PlayStation Direct</a> with a PSVR 2 starting at $499 ($100 off). The latest <em>Horizon </em>title is probably one of the better showcases for what Sony’s PC-grade VR headset is capable of, though new VR modes in AAA games like <em>Resident Evil 7 </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23609901/gran-turismo-7-psvr-2-hands-on"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> are thrilling, to say the least.<em> </em></p><p>Additionally, if you buy a PSVR 2 directly from Sony and subscribe to PlayStation Plus, you’ll also get 12 months of Netflix Premium for free, which saves you about $276 over the course of a year. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">Read our PSVR 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>Sony’s PSVR 2 offers eye tracking, effortless setup, and PC-grade VR without a PC (though it does require a PS5). It can also double as a virtual flatscreen for watching Blu-rays, streaming apps, and other content.</p></div><div><p>Sony sells a bundle consisting of its PSVR 2, controllers, and a physical copy of <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>&nbsp;for the PS5.</p></div><p>Now through June 9th, you can also save up to 30 percent on a <strong>12-month subscription to </strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions"><strong>PlayStation Plus via the PlayStation Store</strong></a>, which is stackable with existing subscriptions. The exact amount varies based on which plan you choose; however, the Essential tier is 20 percent off ($63.99), the Extra tier is 25 percent off ($101.24), and the Premium tier is 30 percent off ($111.99).</p><p>The entry-level <strong>Essential</strong> plan allows you to download free PS Plus games monthly, which are accessible for as long as you’re a subscriber to PlayStation Plus. It also unlocks multiplayer access in games that require it, exclusive discounts, and advanced console features like cloud storage and Share Play. <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong>, meanwhile, offers the same set of perks as well as access to hundreds of titles that rotate regularly, including those that are part of Ubisoft Plus. If you step up to <strong>PS Plus Premium</strong>, you can add game trials, cloud streaming, and access to even more PlayStation classics and a selection of Sony Pictures films.</p><div><p>PlayStation Plus offers three tiers — Essential, Extra, and Premium. All of these subscriptions offer online play, with varying degrees of downloadable games and advanced console features included as part of the membership.</p></div><p>A PlayStation sale without discounted games would be odd, so it’s no shocker that hundreds of digital PS4 and PS5 games are currently on sale. Most are up to 60 percent off, but you’ll find opportunities to save as much as 85 percent on select titles during the various 24-hour flash sales that will be available throughout the event.</p><p>But if you happen to miss something juicy there, you can still find great prices on newer exclusives like <em><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></em>, which is on sale starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MARVELS-SPIDER-MAN-2-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C7WQRCPB?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqTht7xXI">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MARVELSPIDERMAN2">PlayStation Store</a>. The digital deluxe edition is also available for $59.99 ($20 off) from the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MSM2DDE000000000">PlayStation Store</a>, while the collector’s edition is down to $149.99 ($80 off) in the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-games/marvels-spider-man-2-collectors-edition-ps5">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. The latter includes physical extras like a steelbook case and a 19-inch Venom statue featuring Peter Parker and Miles Morales, plus two in-game suits and various skill unlocks.</p><div><p>Insomniac’s latest <em>Spider-Man</em> romp for the PlayStation 5 ups the ante with a vast open world to explore, wonderful web-slinging mechanics, and the ability to play as not one but two spider-men. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> is also worth a look, especially now that it’s on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0783148264580163">PlayStation Store</a>. The modern rendition of Square Enix’s classic JRPG is actually beating the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167183/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-deal-sale-ps5">price we recently called out for the physical copy</a>, though you can also pick up the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0978938405039882">digital deluxe edition on sale for $67.49</a> (about $23 off).</p></div><div><p>The middle game in a three-part trilogy, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> continues the reimagining of the classic PS1 RPG with modern visuals, an expansive open world, new gameplay elements, and even better character development than the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><p>Unsurprisingly, you can also find sales on third-party PS4 and PS5 titles spanning multiple genres. For example, sports gamers looking to crack a bat can pick up <em><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></em> starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqU7HmZMx">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmlb-the-show-24-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-91019524">Target</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA17085_00-MLBTHESHOW24SHIP">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>If you’re not into baseball, there’s also <em><strong>WWE 2K24</strong></em>, which is easily 2K’s best wrestling game yet. It refines some of the more recent gameplay modes and adds new match types, including an ambulance match, a casket match, and a special guest referee. Right now, the base version is on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>The base game is great on its own, but if you’re looking to get the most out of it, I’d recommend grabbing the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24WMEDITION"><strong>40 Years of WrestleMania Edition</strong> for $89.99 ($30 off)</a>. It offers accelerators, boosters, and all five character packs planned for the game, including the new ECW Punk Pack that adds hardcore legends like CM Punk, The Dudley Boyz, Sandman, and Terry Funk.</p><div><p><em>MLB The Show 24</em> features photorealistic graphics, an updated roster with your favorite players, and some of the best baseball gameplay around.</p></div><div><p><em>WWE 2K24</em> is the newest wrestling game for the sports entertainment promotion. It builds on the incredibly fun gameplay of the prior two titles and adds in new game modes, match types, and a bigger roster than ever.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more Days of Play highlights</h3></p><div><ul><li><em><strong>Tekken 8</strong></em> is one of the fiercest fighting games out, and you can start practicing for <a href="https://www.evo.gg/events/las-vegas">July’s Evo tournament</a> with the Deluxe Edition, which is currently on sale for $69.99 ($30 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA10595_00-TK8DXEDITION0000">PlayStation Store</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168682/scavengers-reign-netflix-sci-fi-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1b8eU5">The streaming era operates via a cold and opaque calculus. Many shows unceremoniously premiere with limited promotion, only to face swift cancellation with an equal lack of fanfare. With no real numbers and a few dodgy reports available to the public and creators (now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163463/netflix-most-viewed-tv-movies-2023">a little less dodgy</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893273/wga-hollywood-writers-strike-tv-movie-contract-explained">the WGA strike</a>), a show’s fate can feel like a cosmic joke, with no rhyme or reason to why some soldier on and some never get the chance to find an audience. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max"><em>Scavengers Reign</em></a>, the stunning animated series that debuted on Max last year, found its number was up when the streamer <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-streaming-1235912035/">canceled it earlier this May</a>. However, in a rare moment of clarity, there is a way forward for the show: It just has to be a hit starting today, when it premieres on Netflix. </p>
<p id="wtlh8m">Its new summer home (<em>Scavengers Reign</em> is still available to stream on Max) is <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-1235998046/">reportedly considering a season 2 renewal</a> pending the show’s Netflix debut, though what a favorable run looks like isn’t terribly clear. Mostly, this is just an excuse to exercise a rare bit of streaming-era agency: Go check out <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23599935/best-tv-shows-2023-new">the very best shows of last year</a> and the rare series that earns the superlative of “like nothing else on television,” simply by virtue of its stunning visual design. </p>

<p id="ROllfO">Taking visual cues from European sci-fi artists like Moebius and Simon Roy, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> chronicles the aftermath of a disaster aboard spacecraft Demeter, following a handful of survivors that escaped to the alien world of Vesta Minor, a hauntingly beautiful and hostile world. Yet survival is only a secondary concern for show creators Joe Bennett and Charles Huettner. Instead, the pair use <em>Scavengers Reign</em> as an exercise in crafting a truly alien world, with all of the awe and horror that entails. As our reviewer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max">wrote</a> when the show premiered last fall: </p>
<blockquote><p id="4fJH7x">Creature design and worldbuilding are one and the same in <em>Scavengers Reign</em>. Every animal, from the tiniest insect or docile herbivore to the most colossal and terrifying carnivore, exhibits a behavior that serves a function both within the moment-to-moment beats of an episode and in the larger ecosystem of Vesta Minor as a whole.</p></blockquote>

<p id="jiOdJA">Furthermore, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> isn’t merely concerned with creepy-gorgeous tourism. Instead, like <em>Jurassic Park</em>, its xenobiology doubles as potent metaphor, with each strange encounter a heartbreaking echo of some barely voiced pain each character carries. Why, for example, is the survivor Kamen haunted by his wife when a strange psychic quadruped holds him in its thrall? When local flora begins to infect the circuitry of Levi, the robotic companion of the stranded Azi, Levi begins to show signs of real, bona fide life in her synthetic shell — why does Azi seem so reluctant to see it? And Sam and Ursula, the only two humans stranded together, struggle to survive while maintaining harmony with the strange new land, but can that be done? Or is their struggle to survive inherently destructive? </p>
<p id="NiihK2"><em>Scavengers Reign</em> probes at heavy questions, lingers in moments of beauty and horror, and does it all with wonderfully rendered, languidly paced animation from studio Titmouse. Like all good art, it leaves plenty of room for the viewer to participate in it, to mull it over and think about what meaning might be found in it. It’s the sort of story that’s done something wonderful, and stands a pretty good chance of dazzling us all once more, if given the opportunity. </p>
<p id="THD2fY">Give it a shot on Netflix this weekend. Maybe the show will get another season because of it, and maybe not. But what’s here ought to be celebrated. </p>

<p>Back at The Game Awards 2023, SEGA announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was making five new games</a> based on classic franchises like Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. Six months later, reliable insider Midori has an update the development of various games in the lineup.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796576390554501581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy Twitter thread</a>, Midori said that a number of the games have been pushed to a fiscal year 2028, including Games as a Service (GaaS) titles based on Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. These GaaS titles would be coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the full Unreal Engine 5 remakes</a> of Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio.</p>



<p>“Internally, both the Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi plans had already been previously delayed two different times, including the original reveal dates for the projects.,” he said. “The previous plan before this month was to release Jet Set Radio remake and reboot in 2026 and Crazy Taxi in 2027.” </p>



<p>She continued: “The Remake titles were supposed to release a short while before the reboots for fans of the original titles who did not want to play the GaaS reboots that are currently in development.”</p>



<p>Speaking of the remakes, she says that the Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio remakes were “very similar” to the originals. They will have some feature improvements and additions, however, including multiplayer for Crazy Taxi. Day one cosmetic DLC is also planned for the games.</p>



<p>In addition to those two games, Midori says that Golden Axe was originally planned to release in 2023. It got to the point that marketing plans were created for the game, but then, obviously, plans changed internally with the game not yet officially revealed. </p>



<p>“And now SOA [SEGA of America] is more involved in development and marketing of SEGA titles than before,” she said. “And communication has become more consistent between SOA and SOJ for these titles as part of global initiative. It is not just for Sonic titles.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[1000xResist Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/1000xresist-review.886674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>“Just be grateful you get to say goodbye.” “There’s nothing here for you anymore.” “Nostalgia can be a dangerous thing.” Simple one-liners like these are plentiful in the early conversations of 1000xResist, a story-driven game set in a far-flung future where humanity's scant remains live on through generations of clones. It’s easy to see that kind of writing and get the impression developer Sunset Visitor is perhaps a bit too eager to be melodramatic – but it trusts you’ll stick with it because their delivery and the context around them make moments like these as thoughtful as they are gut-wrenching. A striking visual style and an intoxicating mystery pull you in as its ambitious narrative structure comes together brilliantly, and in the process, its sharply written story makes bold and daring statements about family, political revolution, and the things that make us human.</p><p>It’s quite clear that 1000xResist draws from works like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review">NieR: Automata</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time-review">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>, or Satoshi Kon films, all of which blend surreal concepts with emotionally charged deconstructions of the human condition. You can use that as shorthand to get an idea of what this game goes for, but it quickly shows you that it’s so much more than just an amalgamation of influences. 1000xResist forges a strong identity steeped in its own fiction, establishing a wholly unique sci-fi world with its own culture, rules of governance, and belief systems – it does so with such confidence that I even found myself reciting the phrases its characters use throughout – a little “Hekki ALLMO,” or “Hair to hair,” goes a long way in these streets. That’s a microcosm of the experience; finding things which may not mean much at first glance that evolve into meaningful expressions that cut like a knife.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>1000xResist Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You spend most of your time controlling Watcher, one of six “Sisters” who are the leadership of a small civilization surviving in isolation on a remote station. They’re only referred to by the titles that represent their societal function, and it’s the Allmother, from which everyone was derived, who’s the godlike figure they all seem to revere. The story starts with a jolt by showing Watcher violently drive a shiv into the Allmother’s back, and the intensity of Watcher’s rage gives a staggering first impression – one that grows evermore shocking as you develop a deeper understanding of who the Allmother was. Unraveling this world also revolves around a deadly pandemic that wiped out nearly all of humanity, and the ensuing aftermath sets the foundation for why a society of clones made in her image exists at all.</p><p>You spend much of your time “communing” with other Sisters by navigating dreamlike scenarios, gradually uncovering a greater truth within surreal reconstructions of the Allmother’s memories. Interacting with characters and shifting through different time periods in various locations let conversations play out like pieces to a puzzle. Exploring these ethereal environments paints a more complete and harrowing picture of her life, and literal changes in perspective draw you into each scenario with specific intent – whether it’s through first-person, fixed camera angles, side-scrolling scenes, or third-person views as you fly across nodes to reach objectives, 1000xResist isn’t afraid to break both convention and expectation at critical points.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>1000xResist is a revolution in storytelling.</p></div><p>The station where the Sisters live acts as a main hub and has the vibe of a small-scale Citadel from Mass Effect. Spending time here to talk to the other Sisters and their understudies reveals crucial details that pull you closer to their world and way of life, and there’s so much charm and insight that comes through in these one-off conversations. Although it’s a bit of a pain to navigate, since the station is constructed in some really odd ways with winding hallways that don’t always lead to where you’d expect, it’s always worth the trouble. Even in its unsettling atmosphere where something always feels a little <em>off</em>, it’s still a sort of home that evokes a certain sentimentality.</p><p>Buried within the memories of the Allmother are pieces of her normal life; traces of her relationships at school, a tumultuous upbringing in a home with struggling parents, and some troubling decisions she made along the way. These moments are deeply personal, and distinctly born of the Asian diaspora. 1000xResist is rooted in the experience of a Chinese family coming to the west to seek refuge and rebuild a life from scratch while raising a child. Even when there were specific references to Chinese traditions and Mandarin phrases I wasn’t familiar with (but was always excited to learn about), it was all still so familiar to me, as if there could’ve been an alternate version of this exact story transposed with Filipino traditions and Tagalog phrases. It’s a cathartic and authentic representation of the common ground Asian Americans/Canadians share, extending to anyone who grew up a first generation from an immigrant family – the disconnect we feel from being pushed into assimilating and functioning in a western society while clinging on (sometimes reluctantly) to the cultures of our motherland. It's also an open invitation to those on the outside to see what our lives are really like, and a shining example of how <em>the local is universal</em>.</p><p>In my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review"><u>Persona 3 Reload review</u></a> from earlier this year, I had mentioned that its story and characters put a lot of the recent tragedies and hardships in my own life into perspective. By the time I rolled credits on 1000xResist, it had done the same but in a way that felt more <em>targeted</em>. From the feeling of “making it” when you’ve moved into a tiny apartment to the olive branches parents extend to their angsty teen kids to keep them connected to their culture, these are visions of a life so many of us have lived. 1000xResist is a representation of how we reflect on our upbringing and recognize the ways it shaped us as adults for better and worse, which is perspective that only comes with time and maturity.</p><p>1000xResist’s cultural foundation never becomes self-indulgent because it is the critical context that deftly creates a complete and nuanced depiction of why its world came to be. It forms a powerful connection with the Allmother and establishes the disposition for which all the Sisters share. So, to fully understand 1000xResist is to also understand generational trauma, the damage it leaves on its victims, and the ripple effect it has on those around them. Breaking cycles requires radical action, and whether that be ending harmful habits with our loved ones or upending an unjust status quo, this is a story that believes, and demonstrates how, these two must be closely intertwined.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It dissects the immigrant experience to show something greater than simple representation.</p></div><p>There are allusions to the history of Hong Kong protests that are sometimes used as reference for what sets 1000xResist in motion, but like its other parts, that’s only a jumping off point as the story carves its own path. Tales of rebellion and uprising are aplenty in other games since they provide you with clear motivations, but rarely do you see a game walk you through radicalization on such an intimate level – 1000xResist is the perfect example of “show, don’t tell.” It’s masterfully written to appeal to our humanity rather than preach its politics alone, and it’s far more impactful when the onus is on you to really understand what it’s trying to say. That speaks to how effectively the folks at Sunset Visitor wield their real-world influences and lived experiences as a foundation to tell a story that inspires change, and isn’t afraid to show how cruel and heartbreaking that can be.</p><p>1000xResist doesn’t shy away from the complexities, dangers, and unintended consequences of taking action and following through on a just cause. And it’s smart about where it draws its lines in the sand, expertly identifying how fascism manifests in subversive and insidious ways. It’s easy to depict the boot of corrupt and violent systems crushing the powerless, but watching historical revisionism erase what a people once were (and manipulate those around you) is just as chilling to see unfold. So, what happens when those people are pushed to the brink, and the most desperate begin to push back? These are just a few of the concepts that 1000xResist navigates effortlessly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s often dark with an underlying dread lingering over its more broad story elements. However, that wouldn’t work as effectively as it does without the interpersonal dynamics that drive 1000xResist. In just its 12-hour runtime, fully formed characters are created, with rich personalities that anchor the story’s bold themes. Without that heart and soul, there is no inspiration for a revolution, but this is <em>far </em>from the power of friendship trope often used in stories to save the day. These are realistically flawed characters with believable and complicated relationships. Constant tension and skepticism tests their trust in each other as the systems they’ve lived under start to come under question, and during the moments in between are sobering examples of what it takes to be vulnerable with somebody.</p><p>Another impressive aspect is that every single line of dialogue is voiced and delivered with intent. The voice acting doesn’t come across like a star-studded cast reading from a well-rehearsed script, but actual people in my life speaking to me in a natural setting. It trades theatrics for something authentic, and it’s far more effective for what this story is trying to say. This helps ground its sentimentality, so when characters share their own aspirations or open up to each other, there’s a genuine warmth instead of a cloying melodrama. And when they break down from the traumatic experiences they endure, it’s as if I’m there to console one of my own friends. For as dark as things may get, 1000xResist evokes a certain tenderness and levity in the face of tragedy.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Indie Games</h3><p>These are my personal favorites. Don't hate, appreciate.</p></div><p>The fact that the details of this world aren’t delivered through optional journal entries, a codex in the menus, or long-winded exposition is a testament to how 1000xResist is purposeful in its writing and doesn’t waste its breath. But that’s also a credit to the strength of its art direction and visual storytelling. The shot composition of each sequence and the cinematography of its cutscenes communicate so much of what doesn’t need to be outright said. 1000xResist isn’t a graphically impressive game, but it is certainly a visually striking one. Colors are used as a storytelling device, setting the mood without a word by letting them pop in specific instances. Even though it relies on a basic set of animations, the camera work captures the emotions of its characters to emphasize their most important lines, whether it be off-center close-ups or panning environmental shots. Sunset Visitor flips its technical limitations into one of its greatest assets, letting its creative techniques speak as loud as its words.</p><p>“Sometimes, just to miss something is enough.” “You should appreciate people that see you for who you are.” “You must learn to live with the mistakes you’ve made.” Simple one-liners like these powerfully encapsulate the defining moments of 1000xResist. In its melodrama, it inspires self-reflection and asks us to take stock of what we value most. As fleeting or short-lived as our most cherished memories may be, they can still leave a profound impact on us for the rest of our lives. And when we take a step back to reflect on our place in the world, the hope is that they inspire future action.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="234" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The next entry to the beloved <em>Monster Hunter </em>series is on its way, continuing the hunt that started from the original. Here’s everything you need to know about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, including a release date, platforms, and more.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-monster-hunter-wilds-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Monster Hunter Wilds come out?</h2> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">As of now, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> does not have a set release date, but it is slated for a 2025 launch. Some rumors have been floating around regarding an early 2025 debut. However, this presumption may turn out to be false, indicating a mid to late-year release. Hopefully, Capcom will make an announcement soon to give us a better time frame.</p> <h2 id="h-what-platforms-will-monster-hunter-wilds-be-on" data-injectable="false">What platforms will Monster Hunter Wilds be on?</h2> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will be available to play on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC</strong>. It’s currently available for wishlist via the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. The Xbox version has yet to make its own wishlist page, so we’ll need to wait for this specific platform.</p>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">It isn’t clear if <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will launch on the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monster-hunter-stories-coming-to-switch-playstation-4-and-pc-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>. Yet, it isn’t entirely impossible, given that titles like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-monster-hunter-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> are available to play on the platform.</p> <h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-trailers" data-injectable="false">Monster Hunter Wilds trailers</h2> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">The Game Awards 2023 revealed the very first trailer for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds. </em>It gave us a short sneak peek of various monsters and the formidable Forbidden Lands.</p> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyoBA0aCRNk?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">We also see the playable character riding the new mount, Seikret. Not only is this creature used for traveling, but it can be an excellent asset for hunts. You can utilize it to stash away multiple gear, allowing you to heal and equip several weapons.</p> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-a-first-look-at-its-gameplay-in-the-latest-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play 2024</a> also gave us a first look into gameplay. It focuses more on the game’s combat side, presenting several brutal showdowns.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - 1st Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2u6VmVmhh-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">The trailer shows creatures like the Doshaguma, a fanged beast that lingers in the Windward Plains. We also get a glimpse of the reptilian-like Chatacabra, which uses its saliva to power up its attacks.</p>
 <h2 id="h-will-monster-hunter-wilds-be-open-world" data-injectable="false">Will Monster Hunter Wilds be open world?</h2> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">Since there is little information about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds’</em> gameplay, it needs to be clarified whether the game will be open-world or not. However, the trailer may hint at this feature, mainly because it includes changing environments.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> page mentions two hunting locales: a formidable location with challenging monsters and a much more peaceful area. Creatures also have designated ecosystems, where you’ll primarily start in the Windward Plains.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="false">Due to these unique environmental attributes, an open-world feature may pan out for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds.</em></p>

 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">After completing the Felipe Anderson End of an Era SBC in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team, you’ll get a 93-rated RW item that can operate in several positions. The card has decent stats and playstyles at an affordable price, but nothing that’s meta-defining. However, the SBC is certainly well-worth its costs in terms of required fodder. </p>

			<p>Today, Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Little Nightmares III has been delayed to 2025. The developer and publisher jointly shared this message on Twitter/X:</p>
<p><em>Ever since the announcement of Little Nightmares III at gamescom last year, we've been thrilled to see our community buzzing with excitement and anticipation. </em><br>
<em>The teams at Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco Europe have been working hard towards delivering the best experience possible for the next entry in the franchise. As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. </em><br>
<em>For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025. We'll be sharing more about Little Nightmares III later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.</em></p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last year during Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live. Here's what little we know about Little Nightmares III:</p>
<p><em>In Little Nightmares III, you follow the journey of Low &amp; Alone, as they search for a path that could lead them out of the Nowhere. Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of disturbing places, the two friends will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and escape the grasp of an even greater threat lurking in the shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>For the first time in the franchise, face your childhood fears together with a friend in online co-op, or in solo with an AI companion.</em></p>
<p>Little Nightmares III will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Unofficially, we all know a PC version is likely in the works. Historically, Rockstar has done this many times: Announce a game for consoles, release it, then announce a PC version, and launch that later. But until a <em>GTA 6</em> PC port is officially confirmed and announced, it seems like everyone who works at Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two must be vague  about all of this. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>VGC </em>on May 31</a></span>, when recently asked about <em>GTA 6</em> coming to PC during an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a></span> at a  conference this week, we got this fun word salad from Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement. I guess that could happen, too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone. But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before. And they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time. Okay?</p></blockquote><p>You can definitely read between the lines here and pull from this answer that, yeah, duh, <em>GTA 6</em> is going to get ported to PC. Rockstar always focuses on consoles first, then PC after that. It followed this playbook with <em>GTA V</em> and <em>GTA IV</em>. Zelnick alludes to that by saying “Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before.” </p><p>But again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139">because the industry is obsessed with secrecy</a></span> and holding back every announcement for future events and trailers, Zelnick has to dance around the obvious. You never know when you’ll need to use the announcement of <em>GTA 6</em> on PC as leverage!</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>is set to arrive in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And I bet in 2026 or sooner you’ll get a PC port, just don’t ask anyone at Rockstar or Take-Two about it right now.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It features robot versions of characters from every console generation, and used old console hardware and peripherals as props. It’s evident by just how many references are in its first trailer that <em>Astro Bot </em>is continuing the tradition with a mix of nods to huge PlayStation hits and deep cuts from the brand’s rich past. Here are the characters, consoles, and peripherals we saw in these few minutes of footage.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Right off the bat, we get several references to PlayStation characters in the form of the PlayStation Studios logo screen. Astro leads a stampede of robots, some dressed as PlayStation characters. The menagerie includes <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos and Atreus, Aloy from <em>Horizon</em>, Spike and an ape from <em>Ape Escape</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake, and Ratchet from <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>. Most of these characters will show up again later in the trailer, but it’s not the full extent of the PlayStation heroes that will make an appearance in <em>Astro Bot</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the very first things we see, after being reintroduced to Astro Bot, is a DualSense controller, the PlayStation 5’s next-gen version of the famous Dualshock.

<p data-characters="254" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are countless <em>LEGO </em>sets available to purchase and, if you’re trying to keep to a certain budget, things can get a little complicated. With sets costing hundreds of dollars, it’s not always easy to find an affordable <em>LEGO</em> set to gift or hoard.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">However, as a collector with a child who is also turning into something of a <em>LEGO </em>fan, I’ve had to get thrifty, and I’ve become pretty good at finding <em>LEGO </em>sets on the cheaper side. On this list, I’ve included something for all tastes and the best part? None of these sets sell for more than $50 USD.</p> <h2 id="h-bonsai-tree" data-injectable="false"><strong>Bonsai Tree</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>

Well, almost. You can build one trunk and then have the choice between greenery or Cherry Blossoms to complete the look. I love this set and have it in my bedroom, changing the leaves depending on the season.</p> <h2 id="h-venomized-groot-marvel" data-injectable="false"><strong>Venomized Groot (</strong><strong><em>Marvel</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">I can’t be the only person whose favorite character from the Marvel universe is Groot, and <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/venomised-groot-76249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this set</a> combines him with another favorite – Venom. You can build this set to be either half-venomized or completely venomized, allowing for some customization and variety if you decide to deconstruct and build the set again.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-dobby-the-house-elf-harry-potter" data-injectable="false"><strong>Dobby the House Elf (</strong><strong><em>Harry Potter</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $34.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>

You also get a <em>LEGO </em>version of Tom Riddle’s Diary from The Chamber of Secrets, complete with soggy sock, and the cake which results in bars being put on Harry’s window. Dobby’s giant green eyes and happy smile are just too cute.</p> <h2 id="h-everyone-is-awesome" data-injectable="false"><strong>Everyone is Awesome</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $34.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>

Designed by Matthew Aston, it’s a celebration of inclusivity, positivity and kindness. Even if it’s not designed to be played with, this one’s still a pretty cool set to have. Bonus points if you can avoid getting the song stuck in your head.</p> <h2 id="h-dinosaur-fossils-t-rex-skull-jurassic-world" data-injectable="false"><strong>Dinosaur Fossils: T. Rex Skull (</strong><strong><em>Jurassic World</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $39.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Even if you’re not that much of a fan of the Jurassic World franchise (though I’m unsure how you couldn’t be, at least when it comes to the original movie), this set looks really nice sitting on a shelf. You get both the T. Rex footprint and fossilized skull to display, as well as a small plaque relaying details about real-life T. Rex.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-isabelle-s-house-visit-animal-crossing" data-injectable="false"><strong>Isabelle’s House Visit (</strong><strong><em>Animal Crossing</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $39.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Part of the fairly recent inclusion of Animal Crossing as a <em>LEGO </em>collection, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/isabelle-s-house-visit-77049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Isabelle’s House Visit</a> includes not only the house and surrounding greenery, but also a floating present and two minifigs – Isabelle and Fauna – which complete the scene. The set has only 389 pieces, so it’s one children can help with and enjoy dismantling just to put it back together again.</p> <h2 id="h-orchid" data-injectable="false"><strong>Orchid</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">My fiancé purchased the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/orchid-10311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orchid set</a> for me as a gift and we built it together, so I may be a little biased here, but I cannot overstate how good value this set is. It’s actually pretty big, standing at 15 inches tall, so it’s replaced the real plant on my dining table. I can attest that, as someone who is terrible at keeping houseplants alive, <em>LEGO </em>flowers are an excellent alternative!</p>

It has 600 pieces and, when built, has interactive parts which make it good for both kids and adults.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-spider-tank-star-wars" data-injectable="false"><strong>Spider Tank (<em>Star Wars</em>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="17" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">This mechanical spider from the Mandalorian comes with three minifigs: The Mandalorian himself, Grogu, and Bo-Katan Kryze. The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/spider-tank-75361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider Tank</a> itself has a shooting function, designed to fling tiny bits of LEGO across the living room for you to find hours later once the kids are in bed, so I’d argue that this one should be kept out of small kids, lest your feet feel the force of the LEGO step.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-sword-outpost-minecraft" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Sword Outpost (</strong><strong><em>Minecraft</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="17" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $44.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="false">I have to admit, my first thought when the Minecraft collection of LEGO was announced was, “What took them so long?”. I mean, it’s a world built entirely from blocks so it just makes sense to make things from the game out of LEGO. Well, this is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/the-sword-outpost-21244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the sets</a> now available from the Minecraft LEGO collection, including an oversized version of a Diamond Sword and multiple minifigs, like the adorably blocky pig.</p>

		<p>Nacon is set to take a shot at the sim racing world, announcing the development of its first steering wheel peripherals and the formation of a new department dedicated to racing.</p>
<p>The French publisher and game accessories maker is building the new racing department around KT Racing on the game development side – currently hard at work finishing development of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown – and a new Revosim premium brand that will include Nacon’s first steering wheel.</p>


<p>Revosim will check all the boxes for a modern high-end racing wheel with a direct drive motor, a GT steering wheel design, and a set of pedals with a load cell for braking.</p>
<p>Details on pricing and availability have yet to be announced, but the Revosim will be going up against the best of Thrustmaster, Logitech, Fanatec and more boutique wheel manufacturers. It’s a potentially difficult market to crack, but new contenders are always welcome.</p>
<p>The racing department is being led by Sébastien Waxin, who has been in charge of Nacon’s racing game catalogue of over a decade. For the announcement he said, “We are proud to be presenting, for the first time, the prototype of our first premium racing wheel during Bigben Week. Its development represents a natural step in the evolution of NACON’s expertise, epitomised by the new brand Revosim, which combines the company’s many years of experience in racing simulations with the flagship Revolution accessories brand. We are looking forward to revealing the technical details of the steering wheel in the coming months.”</p>

<p>Nacon is a well established brand for third party gaming peripherals. The RIG gaming headsets have their distinctive industrial style combined with high quality audio, there’s an ever-evolving set of pro controllers for PlayStation and Xbox, keyboards and mice for PC, arcade sticks and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-games-coming-out-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Keeping track of all the latest video games coming out is an increasingly complex task, what with multiple PC storefronts, Xbox One, PS4, Switch, mobile, and more to keep track of, but don’t worry, I’m here to help. Every month I'll be running down the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/games-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games you need to be keeping an eye on</a>, from the big triple-A headliners, to the intriguing indies you might overlook.</p>
<p>June is sure to be a big month for video game news, but it isn’t that big in terms of actual releases. That said, there are still a few promising things coming, including Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Atlus' big revamp of Shin Megami Tensei V. Meanwhile, on the indie front, players can look forward to the atmospheric horror game Still Wakes the Deep, stylish dungeon crawler #BLUD, and more. Oh, and we don't cover DLC in these articles, but still, I feel like I should at least quickly mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is coming out on June 21.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> While I may have played demos or got early access to some of the games recommended in this article, in most cases I’m simply choosing games that look promising, and can’t vouch for the end product. Do wait for reviews before buying! </em></p>
<p>That said, here are the games you should be looking out for in June…</p>
<h2><strong>The Headliners</strong></h2>
<p><iframe title="Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance - Official 'The Ultimate Beginning' Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edeihC8xHt0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance (PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 &amp; Switch, June 14)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shin-megami-tensei-v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> originally came and went without too much fanfare as a Switch exclusive back in 2021, but now Atlus is giving the game another chance to shine. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance not only totally revamps the game’s presentation for more powerful platforms, but adds an entire second story path, new areas, demons, and more. Atlus considers this the new standard version of SMTV, going so far as to remove the older Switch version from sale. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWN2RMFT/?tag=wccftech0a9-20">pre-order Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD - Nintendo Direct 9.14.2023" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIP2_LJdi0I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD (Switch, June 27)</strong></p>
<p>Continuing our theme of underappreciated games getting another shot, in between the original Luigi’s Mansion and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-3-bustin-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, Nintendo released the 3DS-exclusive Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon. It was a very ambitious game by 3DS standards, and now it’s getting a full Switch revival under the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a>. Rev up your Poltergust and check out the Luigi’s Mansion game you may have missed out on. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYPPRX3N/?tag=wccftech0a9-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Promising Indies</strong></h2>
<p><iframe title="#BLUD - Official Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Eu6q2V3i5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#BLUD (PC, June 18)</strong></p>
<p>Looking for a Diablo-esque dungeon crawler without &nbsp;all the darkness and gloom? Well, then #BLUD might be for you. The game combines dungeon crawling with lively Nickelodeon-style animation (and some violence you wouldn’t see on Nick). Oh, yeah, and there’s vampires, too! Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921480/BLUD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for #BLUD</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Still Wakes the Deep - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGz5zvgCOEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Still Wakes the Deep (PC, Xbox Series X/S &amp; PS5, June 18)</strong></p>
<p>A good setting can make or break a horror story, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, set on a massive isolated deep sea oil rig off the coast of Scotland, has a great one. Developed by Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room, Still Wakes the Deep has some atmospheric walking-sim-style elements to it, but it also looks to serve up plenty of intense moments of survival and otherworldly horror. This is indie horror amped up. Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Still Wakes the Deep</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Until Then - Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDCwoJQrAOY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Until Then (PC &amp; PS5, June 25)</strong></p>
<p>Until Then is a gorgeously hand-crafted 2D narrative adventure that aims to immerse players in the dramatic world of high school kids living in the Philippines. You’ll be doing more than just chilling out though, as the game also weaves in magical and mystery elements to draw the story along. Video games can transport you like few other mediums, and this looks like a journey worth taking. Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Until Then</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Times &amp; Galaxy (PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5 &amp; Switch, June 21)</strong></p>
<p>As somebody who’s spent 15 years writing for a living, I can assure you it isn’t always that exciting, but I must admit, Times &amp; Galaxy looks to do a pretty good job of making journalism entertaining. For starters, the game takes place in a fun sci-fi setting and features a “build-a-story” mechanic that turns writing into a sort of fun puzzle (if only it was really like that!) Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/883230/Times_and_Galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Times &amp; Galaxy</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-hellblade-2-patch-addresses-ghosting-issues-improves-fsr3-artifacts-alongside-numerous-other-fixes.886620/</guid>

			<p>Ninja Theory has deployed a new Hellblade 2 patch, packing fixes for several issues, including frame generation ghosting issues, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch is a minor one for Ninja Theory's recently released Hellblade sequel, but one that will be welcomed by fans nonetheless. Aside from the aforementioned fixes for frame generation issues, this new update improves FSR3 artifacts, addresses some crashing issues, and fixes some encountered memory leaks. In addition, the update fixes missing captions as well as facial animations, and adds a warning prompt when selecting ‘New Story’ (this option resets the current save's story progress).&nbsp;You can find the full release notes for this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/4166471769756034428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade 2 patch here</a>.</p>
<p>Hellblade 2 is available worldwide now across PC and Xbox. The game is also available through Game Pass. Here's what we wrote about this great-looking sequel to 2017's Hellblade in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> earlier this month:</p>
<p><em>"On that note, Ninja Theory will assuredly get their latest work in the hands of many more users, which is great for this type of experience. However, I'm not so sure Microsoft will be just as happy with the return on investment, especially since Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is otherwise sold at $49 (instead of the original's $29) and is unlikely to set sales charts on fire. I expect Microsoft&nbsp;will eventually release it on PlayStation consoles&nbsp;to maximize profits.</em></p>
<p><em>I still have to discuss the audiovisual department. There's not much to say here except that it is absolutely stellar. Unreal Engine 5 is used to its full extent, with Nanite making a particularly impressive showcase of its virtual geometry in the impressive rendering of Iceland's rocky environments. The atmosphere and lighting are fantastic, although I found certain scenes to be a bit too dark, to the point where you literally had to increase the gamma to see anything."</em></p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24168219/longlegs-director-preview-nicolas-cage-serial-killer-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/longlegs%E2%80%99-director-on-what-the-horror-movie%E2%80%99s-viral-marketing-campaign-is-hiding.886617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168219/longlegs-director-preview-nicolas-cage-serial-killer-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="m2X4Rj">If you’ve seen anything about <em>Longlegs</em>, from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24055798/longlegs-horror-movie-trailer-teaser-release">cryptic teasers to its spooky trailer</a>, you probably know it’s an upcoming horror movie about a serial killer played by Nicolas Cage. You also probably don’t know much else. </p>
<p id="FHiSSP">The trailer has elements that certainly feel recognizable, like a young female FBI agent investigating a notorious serial killer, but there’s an overwhelming sense of unease and mystery that leaves the whole thing feeling just a little bit off, enhancing the creepiness and unfamiliarity. And according to director Oz Perkins, that’s very much by design. </p>
<p id="PqWxRL">Perkins describes <em>Longlegs </em>as a “pop-punk, nostalgic serial killer movie with a supernatural flavor,” but he didn’t want to throw all that at audiences right away. </p>
<p id="s17SK6">“[I] used things like <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, <em>Se7en</em>, and <em>Zodiac </em>as kind of primers,” Perkins says. “So the audience sees those clues, or those cues, and says, <em>OK, I understand how this will work.</em>”<em> </em></p>

<p id="yCZ1cS">But these cinematic touchstones are more like starting points than destinations for Perkins, a veteran horror filmmaker whose past work, like <em>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</em> and <em>Gretel &amp; Hansel</em>, has proven popular in the world of arthouse horror but never quite broken into the mainstream. </p>
<p id="jxHTVM">“It’s meant to be easier on an audience to connect with it. So that when it gets funky, and it does get funky, we’ve kind of earned it,” Perkins explains. “It’s more playful at that point. I think in previous movies, I think I’ve gotten a little opaque. [...] Now I want to make something that more people will enjoy, and will give me more latitude to do what I want, so it starts with something more familiar.”</p>
<p id="rNXipH">Perkins’ work on the movie started with the character of Longlegs, who had been figuratively lurking in the background and at the edges of some of his previous stories and ideas. He said he knew certain things about the character, but compared it to seeing the back of someone who looks familiar as they leave a convenience store: You’re so positive you know them, but you can never be totally sure — a terrifying description for a character that would later become a serial killer. </p>
<p id="ZMk3CA">“I knew that he drove up to people’s houses, on their birthdays, or on their kids’ birthdays,” Perkins says. “And he brought with him sort of, maybe, stuffed animals? He was a clown or a singer or magician or performer or something.”</p>
<div id="YqjI2J"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OG7wOTE8NhE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="rDcGgL">But turning that vague idea of a character into something to center a movie around proved to be more of a puzzle for Perkins. He says he worked it out like a crossword puzzle, understanding the shape and space he had allotted, then fitting in the details that would make the movie work and make it accessible for audiences, like turning Longlegs into a serial killer, or centering the movie on a young FBI agent to pull in a <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> homage — a movie he says made a huge impression on him as a kid. </p>
<p id="80GtH5">Another key piece of the puzzle for Perkins was adding Nicolas Cage to the project as the serial killer in question. Perkins says Cage read the script and loved it, and that he brings an undeniably unique energy to all his characters. It was Perkins’ job to find a way to channel that energy. </p>
<p id="cqXDzl">“There’s no version where I’m going to try to change him into something that he’s not, or try to diffuse what he’s going to bring,” Perkins explains. “You don’t get Nicolas Cage in your picture unless you want what he’s going to bring. You kind of just wait and see what it is. And you have faith and trust that it’s going to be right. And in this case, it really is.”</p>
<div id="H4XxrK"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/es1pFnq_VJ4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="dt3v65">As for where the story of <em>Longlegs </em>goes after the familiar setup, Perkins didn’t offer many details, preferring to save the surprises for when people can see the movie for themselves. However, he did offer up the tantalizing note that David Lynch is a particularly big inspiration for him. </p>
<p id="ZrOzQV">“<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23298759/twin-peaks-movie-fire-walk-with-me-anniversary-criterion"><em>Fire Walk with Me</em></a> was really important to me,” he says. “I feel like the tempo, the environment, the cadence of things, the world, those things are really deep in my psyche and I think they probably come in the wash a bit.” </p>
<p id="uvPY6t">One thing Perkins does make clear is that viewers are best off experiencing all of <em>Longlegs</em>’ twists and surprises in a theater if they can. </p>
<p id="mTrjWC">“We are hiding something under a veil,” Perkins teases. “We are hiding something under a curtain and it’s more fun to pull the sheet off when there’s a lot of people watching. It’s kind of like, <em>Gather around so we can reveal the Elephant Man.</em> And I think doing that in a room with people, in an immersive experience of the theater — I’m proud to have made a movie that works well that way.”</p>
<p id="ylvuYr"><small><em>Longlegs </em></small><small>will be in theaters on July 12.</small></p>

Summer is here. Pride month is here.

The studio’s been quiet about the game for a long time now, sparingly offering up updates over the last year, but it’s finally here and I’m relishing the chance to play it all weekend. Inspired by Taoism, but mechanically akin to a 2D <em>Sekiro</em>, I’ve been stoked on <em>Nine Sols</em>’ blending of faith, mythology and a grim sci-fi world since I first saw it. A demo from a year ago assured me of its mechanics, and now that it’s in my hand, I’m finally able to lose myself in <em>Nine Sols</em> and parry my way through its gorgeously rendered world. Just as soon as I finish <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, though. – Moises Taveras<br></p><p><em>*Your mileage may vary</em></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-recommend-id="image://76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-recommend-id="image://76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This game burned me out bad, man. My most anticipated release of 2024,<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> quickly exhausted my hype levels. I went hard the first weekend it came out, played several evenings afterwards, and then drifted to playing once or twice a week. I reached peak enjoyment while perfecting my timing during the Shinra parade in Junon, and quickly hit a wall upon arriving in Costa Del Sol. It’s not that I ever stopped enjoying the game—my momentum just kind of fizzled. Tons of other stuff came out. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>was much easier to drop in and out of during spare moments here and there. More recently, <em>Diablo IV</em>’s been serving as that end-of-evening brain-off respite. But I really want to finish <em>Rebirth</em>. I need to finish<em> Rebirth</em>. So this weekend I’m going to try to mainline the story as much as possible before the endless mini-games and open-world side activities once again grind things to a halt. I love that stuff, but I can’t wait 100 hours to see this ending everyone hates so much. At least nothing’s coming out next month to get in my way. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-recommend-id="image://d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Cicada Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-recommend-id="image://d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Switch,<strong> </strong>Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Stars!

I don’t know what caused me to even load up <em>Isles of Sea &amp; Sky</em>, given its Sokobanish stylings, but I’m ever so glad I did.</p><p>This is far more than standard block-pushing. This is a vast, ever-expanding world of islands to explore, each packed with unique puzzles, often solvable in two or three different ways for different rewards. It has heavy <em>A Link to the Past</em> undertones, while never feeling like it’s leaning on <em>Zelda</em> as an inspiration, instead possessing its own unique character. Each island has a sort of deity-like being that needs you to find six of at least a dozen tokens, which will then unlock new blocks that allow you to re-approach the area’s puzzles using new skills. For instance, the second island you’ll likely explore has specific blue blocks that are eventually transformed into gorgeous little blue sprites, who will take on the properties of any block they’re shoved into. This obviously has enormous consequences on puzzles you couldn’t solve before, and offers new ways to approach those you could to reach a different prize.</p><p>I really, really thought I was done with this genre, usually finding the nature of sokoban puzzles—where you’re endlessly finding yourself in dead-ends—to be far too frustrating, but <em>Isles of Sea &amp; Sky</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://islesofseaandsky.com/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://islesofseaandsky.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">once known as <em>Akurra</em></a></span>) removes all of this with single-button taps to take back any move, and another tap to reset a location.

I felt a bit of this concern before diving back into one of my all-time favorite games, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, via its brand-new remake on the Switch.

Navigating the world, and using Mario’s ever-increasing assortment of abilities—err, I mean terrible curses—to find secrets and access new areas, is a delight, and the combat hits that sweet spot of being accessible to genre newcomers and deep enough to keep you engaged. But yes, come for the writing, and the game’s endearing papercraft visuals, which look better than ever on the Switch. You won’t be disappointed. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-recommend-id="image://17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->rose-engine / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-recommend-id="image://17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5,<strong> </strong>PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Just enjoy it</p></div><p>Ever since I reviewed the retro-inspired horror game<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span> at the beginning of May (and found it lacking), I’ve been itching to revisit 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/signalis-survival-horror-impressions-review-pc-ps4-xbox-1849730503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/signalis-survival-horror-impressions-review-pc-ps4-xbox-1849730503"><em>Signalis</em></a></span>. The first game from the two-person team Rose Engine was one of my favorite of the year, and it’s never quite left my mind since. Like <em>Crow Country</em>, <em>Signalis </em>is a survival horror game that visually and mechanically pulls heavily from the PlayStation 1 games that defined the genre (think <em>Silent Hill </em>and <em>Resident Evil</em>). Where the two differ, however, is in execution. </p><p><br><em>Signalis </em>is one of those rare retro-inspired games that so intrinsically understands what makes its inspirations tick, and is able to not only recreate their greatness but build on it. The game follows android LSTR as she seeks to find her partner in the abandoned halls of a mining facility, now overrun with zombie-like creatures. Through item scarcity, inventory management and puzzles, the player must go deeper into the facility as you learn what caused a mysterious disease now running rampant. On top of the excellent use of tension is a wonderfully twisting story about love, and it’s pretty excellent. <em>Signalis </em>is a game that constantly rewards revisiting its world and I can’t wait to see what new things I pick up on this time around. – Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-recommend-id="image://5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Player First Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-recommend-id="image://5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Figure out if I actually like this game or not</p></div><p>I don’t like most platform fighters, and I don’t think WB’s crossover brawler <em>Multiversus </em>is going to be any different.

<p>PlayStation might have some announcements during Summer Games Fest 2024, it’s been claimed.</p>



<p>Renowned tipster, <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796320512081354980">Midori</a>, known for their scoops related to SEGA and Nintendo, recently tweeted about PlayStation attending Summer Game Fest. The post informed players that more information regarding “Metaphor: ReFantazio and Sonic X Shadow Generations” will be relayed during the Summer Game Fest. Adding to this, Midori stated that we can expect announcements on “more titles from SIE studios too”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is hard to know what PlayStation will showcase at the event, as they have only revealed that they will be at the event in some capacity. However, we speculate that it could be the game that LEGO and PlayStation are collaborating to create, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a>, which was exclusively reported by Insider Gaming earlier this month. The game should be similar to what we have seen in their Star Wars, Marvel, DC, and other Traveller’s Tale series of games. Sources previously revealed that the game would be “Horizon Forbidden West but LEGO.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other than that, players are hoping that we might receive something from Sucker Punch, maybe a reveal for Ghost of Tsushima 2. Geoff Keighley also has a close relationship with Kojima, so we might get another glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a>. In addition, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-officially-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astrobot pre-orders</a> are set to go live on June 7, so another look at the game could be on hand during the main show.</p>



<div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment recently hosted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, which included a series of announcements and reveals such as Astro Boy, Concord, God of War: Ragnarok PC release date and a bunch more for PSVR 2 too. It seems this dedicated event was probably not long enough for them to provide us with updates on all of their projects. Which could be a reason enough to take the stage during Summer Game Fest 2024. </p><p>What do you think PlayStation could be cooking up for Summer Game Fest in 2024?</p></div>

<p>Battlestate Games has just revealed that the next global wipe event in Escape from Tarkov will take place in August, making it one of the longest durations between wipes in the game’s history. This reveal took place today on the TarkovTV broadcast, during which Nikita Buyanov shared plenty of information about what’s coming next, ranging from new weapons to hideout expansions – and much more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-next-wipe-is-still-months-away">Tarkov’s Next Wipe is Still Months Away</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has had a tough time of it of late. The game has been the subject of much controversy, particularly with Battlestate Games introducing a brand-new edition of the game that was deemed ‘pay-to-win’ and borderline disrespectful to existing players. In recent weeks, the team at Battlestate Games has tried to make amends, including leaning more actively into community feedback to make Escape from Tarkov ‘better’.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of TarkovTV, Nikita Buyanov revealed that the patch that’ll bring the next wipe is dropping in August 2024. He didn’t specify a date, but referenced that it would be ‘early August’. The last wipe was in December, so it’s a lengthy gap – one of the longest between wipes in Tarkov history.</p>



<p>Here are some other tidbits coming to Tarkov per the showcase:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bipods</li>



<li>New weapons (M60)</li>



<li>Hideout areas</li>



<li>Mannequins and more display mechanics in the Hideout</li>



<li>A new secure stash box</li>



<li>New apparel</li>



<li>Crossovers between Arena and Escape from Tarkov</li>



<li>‘Arena Boxes’ – loot boxes, essentially</li>



<li>Factory rework</li>



<li>Tripwires and landmines (both AI and players) on containers and dead bodies</li>



<li>PMC Karma</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s plenty more coming – so stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anger-foot-is-like-john-wick-with-some-extra-kick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hands-on with the frantic first-person shooter that brings new meaning to the term foot soldier.</h2></div><section><p>Fast-paced first-person shooters may be a dime a dozen these days, but Anger Foot has a unique gameplay hook that is literally kicking the door down for your attention. This colourful and completely chaotic shooter from the makers of Broforce is like a first-person take on the compelling, room-clearing carnage of Hotline Miami, with an emphasis on using your left foot of fury to violently smash a path through locked doors, obstacles, and gangs of anthropomorphic animal enemies. It’s a shoot and boot ‘em up that feels like John Wick with some extra kick, and I enjoyed the two hours I spent playing an early build of Anger Foot every skull-stomping step of the way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are guns too, of course, but the pistol in your hand is merely a support act to the size 12 snuffer of life at the end of your left leg. There’s no ammunition to pick up and reload, instead once you’ve run out of rounds to chamber you just throw your empty gun at an enemy to stun them, jump-kick them into next week, and catch their freshly dropped uzi or shotgun before carrying on your merry, murderous way. Enemies can be booted directly into their friends behind them like dim-witted dominoes, and there’s never any shortage of explosive gas canisters or oil barrels to be found in each gang den you crash through, allowing for spectacular chain reaction kills – or your own instant death should you accidently shoot them at close quarters.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The pistol in your hand is merely a support act to the size 12 snuffer of life at the end of your left leg.</p></div><p>In fact, I’ve died a lot during the two-dozen levels I’ve played so far, since you’re every bit as vulnerable to one-shotted deaths as the enemies around you. A continually shuffling roster of enemy types and combinations meant that Anger Foot consistently kept me on my anger toes, forcing me to find new strategies to most efficiently deal with each new threat. When riot gear clad birds arrived I started firing off a round to make them reflexively raise their shields so that I could run in and boot their bulletproof barriers straight back into their beaks. Meanwhile I was delighted to find that the grenades thrown by puffer jacket-clad goons could be volleyed back at them with a well-timed kick, forcing them to watch their own bomb blow up in their faces like they were the producers of the Madame Web movie.      </p><p>Surviving all the way to each level exit earns you a star, but there are a further two stars to claim per level for optional challenges such as completing a level within a stricter time limit, or killing a certain number of enemies using only your foot. Some of these additional objectives seem seriously challenging, and although each level only takes a couple of minutes to complete I can see myself spending hours trying to earn all the stars in the finished game – although I don’t know how I’m supposed to beat a level in under 30 seconds when I keep getting distracted by the playable Broforce arcade machines found along the way. </p><p>The more stars you earn, the more special shoes you can unlock and lace up, with each pair of kicks granting you a unique gameplay buff not unlike the animal masks from Hotline Miami. You might strap on a pair of high tops that earns you a precious round of ammo for every bad guy you boot in the face, or slip into a pair of sneakers that activates a big head mode to make it easier to headshot enemies from long range. I also found footwear that could charge up kicks into room-clearing dash attacks, as well as another pair that let me come back from the dead once per level. Talk about a sole revival!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Anger Foot Screens</h3></div></output><p>I also unlocked a slightly embarrassing pair of socks with sandals that allowed me to deal extra damage during boss fights, although this did mean that I was able to easily stomp out Anger Foot’s first major boss like it was a house spider under a work boot. Given how tricky the levels that preceded it were, including one against an unseen sniper that instantly snuffed out my sprints between cover, it seemed slightly disappointing to dispatch the leader of the Violence Gang with a mere handful of half-hearted highkicks. Hopefully there’ll be some heavier head honchos to contend with in the three other gangs to take down in Anger Foot – namely the Pollution Gang found in the sewers, the Business Gang found in the high rises, and the Debauchery Gang found in… I don’t know, one of P. Diddy’s mansions, probably.  </p><p>Basic boss fights aside, Anger Foot’s evolving combat and cartoonish charm kept a goofy grin on my face during my playtime, and its rousing, bass-heavy techno groove had me tapping my toes while I was capping my foes – from rooftop shootouts with heavily-armed gangbangers to subterranean stoushes with snakes and giant squid tentacles in the sewers below. It remains to be seen if the instantly gratifying action of Anger Foot will have the anger legs to go the distance in the finished game, but based on what I’ve played so far it seems like this is one frantic first-person shooter that’s truly putting its best foot forward.</p><p><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Editor in IGN's Sydney office.

IMAGE CREDIT: EMBRACER GROUP.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>The triple-A video game industry collectively raised the price of its video games with the launch of the current console generation in 2020, but in recent months the $70 price point has become the topic of much discussion amid the industry’s ongoing struggles. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamers-mostly-played-older-games-like-gta-5-and-fortnite-in-2023">Recent data points to gamers tending to favor older, live service games</a>, such as Fortnite, Roblox, and Call of Duty, leaving less room for new, full price games.</p><p>Indeed, Embracer has seen a number of high-profile flops, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-flopped-embracer-says-after-laying-off-staff">including the recently released horror revival Alone in the Dark</a>, which Wingefors said was “a big investment” that “didn't catch enough consumers”.</p><p>"I think the industry is facing the same problem as all other industries, with inflation and rising costs of game development," Wingefors added. "And it's been hard to increase pricing [in] premium PC/console. The pricing of those products has been the same for many years, which means that the margin to succeed is less, and on top of that, there is a higher cost of capital. Ultimately when you make big investments or games, you need to play with teams you are very confident in, or with IPs you own or control, and have the full financial income.</p><p>"On top of that, the consumers have more content than ever to choose from. They love to engage in established IPs they've been playing before, which means it's harder to have them trying out new things or new IPs. It's just something we're all facing. It's a reality which we have been adapting to over the past year, and we will continue to adapt to that reality."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The pricing of those products has been the same for many years...</p></div><p>Wingefors’ comments suggest Embracer is waiting for another video game company to go first, essentially, before it follows suit with a price hike. But what company could justify such a move, which would likely be met with a backlash from gamers?</p><p>Rockstar is currently the subject of debate around this topic, with the Take-Two-owned company preparing to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> late 2025. Rockstar has yet to announce a price for GTA 6, or how the game will be sold, but there are few other games that would move the needle quite as much as this behemoth.</p><p>In November 2023, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said video game frontline prices “are still very, very low” compared to other forms of entertainment “because we offer many hours of engagement”.</p><p>“The value of the engagement is very high,” Zelnick added. “So, I think the industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power. However, there is a great deal of value offered.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Or is it?</h2></div><section><p>Chasing the End doesn’t hide its inspirations for even a second. In the opening scene, Rion, a young woman in Seoul, South Korea, rises from the bed in her apartment building, the TV in the corner showing nothing but static, and a not-so-subtle pixel-art poster of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review">Playdead’s 2016 masterpiece</a> Inside hanging on the wall behind her. </p><p>In fact, Inside is the only pristine thing you could possibly be reminded of as you explore Rion’s world. Everything has gone to hell: trash coats the floors of her building, rooms are boarded up, the walls are cracked and crumbling, and as an elderly neighbor stops Rion for a quick chat to plead for help cleaning her place up, it quickly becomes clear that this is not a prosperous world. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Chasing the End - Screenshots (plus a bonus gif)</h3></div></output><p>In fact, Rion tells her nosy neighbor that she’s given up and that she’s heading to the Han River, where we soon guide her and learn that she intends to jump off the bridge, as so many others have before her – all signified by the shoes left on the side of the railing. She has second thoughts though, fortunately, and is then startled by the sound of gunfire and a crash. She meets a wounded soldier whose quick trigger ensured that he was the only survivor of the scuffle. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Inside poster on Rion's wall is the only pristine thing you could possibly be reminded of as you explore her doomed world. </p></div><p>As he bleeds out, he entrusts her with a data key; it’s something that, if the soldier is to be believed, is so valuable that it could buy Rion a ticket to a life that will last longer than the week or so the Earth has left before it’s destroyed by guaranteeing her passage on an escape rocket for the rich and elite. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And thus Rion has a reason to hope, and Chasing the End has its gameplay catalyst. The demo I played only contained the Prelude and part of Chapter 1, but after setting up its raison d'etre, it shows off the start of what to expect: plenty of physics-based puzzles. Like the Playdead games that inspired it, Chasing the End will have you manipulating objects in the environment in order to clear obstacles and open paths to the next area. The controls are simple – there’s just one interact button and a jump button – and so far it’s nothing complicated (at least, in this super early slice of the campaign), but it’s enough to get you thinking as you’re drawn towards the next part of Rion’s story. </p><p>I quite like Chasing the End’s simple but very bleak pixel-art visual style, and there’s already more dialogue here than in all Playdead games ever made combined, which doesn’t guarantee quality, but it does at least promise that developer Jino isn’t trying to make a shameless Inside clone. There is an original idea here – and a rather captivating one at that thanks to the asteroid-induced apocalypse that serves as the backdrop for the action – so let’s see if the team is able to fulfill its potential.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Former game director Joe Blackburn teased a Xur rework last year, suggesting a more exciting-experience with the arms dealer after the expansion goes live. For now, here's where Xur is this week and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week you can find Xur on <strong>Nessus, </strong>in <strong>The Watcher's Grave</strong>. For his weapon, Xur is offering <strong>SUROS Regime</strong>. Hunters can pick up <strong>Graviton Forfeit</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Actium War Rig</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Karnstein Armlets</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311051-xurnessus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311051" data-ratio="0.56197916666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311051-xurnessus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311051"></a><figcaption>Xur's location on Nessus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311051-xurnessus.jpg"></figure><p>Head to Nessus and use the Watcher's Grave transmat zone to find Xur this week. When you arrive, hop on your sparrow and head north toward the exit of the area. Look for a big tree with pink moss on the right side of the area. Climb up onto its big, flat branch, where you can reach Xur.</p><h2>Xur Exotic and Legendary Items</h2><ul><li>Exotic Engram - 97 Legendary Shards</li><li>SUROS Regime - 29 Legendary Shards</li><li>Graviton Forfeit - 23 Legendary Shards</li><li>Actium War Rig - 23 Legendary Shards</li><li>Karnstein Armlets - 23 Legendary Shards</li><li>Hawkmoon - 200 Legendary Shards, 125,000 Glimmer, 1 Ascendant Shard, 1 Exotic Cipher</li><li>Xenology quest - Free</li><li>Legendary weapons and armor - 50 Legendary Shards, 1,000 Glimmer</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Exotic Armor</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Graviton Forfeit (Exotic Hunter helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311082-destiny22024-05-3119-07-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311082" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311082-destiny22024-05-3119-07-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311082"></a><figcaption>Graviton Forfeit</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311082-destiny22024-05-3119-07-05.jpg"></figure><p>For the Hunter who enjoys sticking to the shadows, Graviton Forfeit increases the duration of invisibility effects. Additionally, your melee recharges faster, your weapons reload more quickly, and recovery is greatly increased. Mobility is pretty decent for an Exotic where you'll want to move quickly in and out of danger, recovery is pretty good, and intellect is high enough to allow for quicker cooldowns on your Super. Resilience and strength are very low, so this weak roll is hard to recommend this week.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 18</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 69</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Actium War Rig (Exotic Titan chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311084-destiny22024-05-3119-07-15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311084" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311084-destiny22024-05-3119-07-15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311084"></a><figcaption>Actium War Rig</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311084-destiny22024-05-3119-07-15.jpg"></figure><p>If you're picking up a SUROS Regime this week and you're playing as a Titan, Actium War Rig is a great Exotic to pair it with. This chest piece steadily reloads a portion of your equipped auto rifle or machine gun, allowing you to fire for longer. Sweet Business is one of the best Exotics to use with it, as you'll be shooting for days with this armor. Mobility is unnecessarily high on this build, but with a high intellect stat, it could work nicely for a build focused on popping a Ward of Dawn Super as quickly as possible. Resilience and recovery aren't too bad, but the low strength stat will need to be increased with armor mods.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 70</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Karnstein Armlets (Exotic Warlock gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311085-destiny22024-05-3119-07-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311085-destiny22024-05-3119-07-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311085"></a><figcaption>Karnstein Armlets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4311085-destiny22024-05-3119-07-24.jpg"></figure><p>A vampiric Exotic, Karnstein Armlets grant cure and restoration instantly when you land a melee or finisher final blow.

The studio recently <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/02/29/crash-bandicoot-4-spyro-reignited-trilogy-dev-toys-for-bob-is-splitting-from">went independent</a> after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.</p>

<p>The studio states its new title is "very early in development" and that we won't see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn't surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xbox</a> to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜 <a href="https://t.co/6EqrQbabpv">pic.twitter.com/6EqrQbabpv</a></p>

</div>

<p>Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/13/microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard</a>. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="253" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been waiting impatiently for the updated <em>Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail</em> Benchmark, I’ve got good news for you. The new version finally has a release date of June 3, and we’ve also got new information about what to expect when it’s here.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">While the release date for the updated <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yoshida-acknowledges-ffxiv-dawntrail-benchmark-complaints-updated-version-on-the-way/">Benchmark</a> software has been up in the air for a while, we do at least have some evidence of the hard work put in to get <em>Dawntrail</em> looking as it should, and the June 3 release date means players still have plenty of time to make sure their setups can handle <em>Dawntrail</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">The further delay can be at least partly attributed to the fact that routine building inspections at the development offices will result in ‘full power outages’ on June 1 and 2, meaning that any issues that arose during an earlier release would be left two days without attention. I wouldn’t want to be that building inspector.</p>

            <p>
Arkane Austin's ailing vampire shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> has received its final update, as the developers themselves are purged by parent company Microsoft. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-will-receive-one-final-update-after-all-including-an-offline-mode">Announced a few weeks back</a>, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new in-game progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That's in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new Elder Nests will appear around Redfall much like Heart Nests, and are distinguished by a purple glow. Slay the boss vampire lurking within, and you'll earn a temporary Heart Shard buff that scales to campaign difficulty.  As for the revamped Neighbourhood stuff, there are six ranks of Community Standing encompassing 39 permanent buffs, from cosmetics appearing on your map and compass to an Escape Plan buff that activates a salvaged Bellwether cloak for 10 seconds when your health is critical. 
</p>
<p>
"All the upgrades from the Community Standing Skill Tree are meant to provide you with a mixture of QoL and gameplay benefits," the developers note. "A few of the traits will even help collectors finish out their hunt for cosmetics and Grave Locks. You can read more about the patch on <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/57LBTGVNF2rYof6K3yMGLP/redfall-game-update-4-available-now?linkId=100000263752169">Bethesda's official site</a>.  
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced</a> that Arkane Austin together with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tango-gameworks-deserves-to-be-remembered-for-more-than-shinji-mikami">Hi-Fi Rush developers Tango Gameworks</a> would close on May 7th, in what Xbox's Matt Booty termed a "consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP." 
</p>
<p>
Arkane Austin's other works include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">the wonderful Prey</a>. Redfall isn't nearly as captivating, but I think even detractors would agree that it harboured the spark of something greater, with an engrossing setting and visual direction that were spoiled by bugs, a shortage of compelling activities and some rather scanty post-launch support during its first year.</p>
<p>
"The thing is, I actually quite like wandering around Redfall," Ed Thorn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-review">wrote in our review</a>. "Discounting the pop-in and the MMO-esque warring factions that don't actually damage one another, it's got some impressive buildings and occasional hints of Arkane magic, and even the jank can't pull me out of enjoying the lazy port town controlled by vampires. There's a nice ratio of imposing museums to auburn flora, coupled with moments of wonder as you notice the sea's been parted by supernatural forces, or as you're whisked into the warped halls of a vampire's brain during a big set piece. Interiors are also on point, too. Arkane know how to make rooms seem lived in and there's plenty of it here."</p>
<p>
While it'll never be the game it could have been, Arkane Austin managing to add offline support in the face of layoffs means that Redfall won't vanish as and when Microsoft turns off its servers. "So many people worked so hard to make this patch a reality, even after they learned Arkane was closing," lead narrative designer Steve Powers <a href="https://x.com/stevepowers/status/1796225006763942191">wrote on Xitter</a> as the patch went live last night. "I am so immensely proud of the Arkane team and will treasure my time with them forever."
</p>
<p>Best of luck to all of Arkane Austin's survivors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-until-dawn-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has a plan. It doesn’t involve Tahiti, though. Its goal is to launch a few exclusives on PC, then keep the sequels to said games on its console ecosystem. In turn, the company expects fans to buy a PlayStation 5 or, in the future, a PlayStation 6 to continue playing a franchise. Little do they know, we’re patient players. But those games that are coming to PC now have a few caveats to consider for many. Namely, does Until Dawn require a PSN account on PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-a-psn-account-to-play-until-dawn-on-pc">Do You Need a PSN Account to Play Until Dawn on PC?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, right alongside God of War Ragnarok, Until Dawn requires a PSN account to play on PC. Despite being a single-player cinematic experience, Until Dawn features PlayStation Trophies and the new PlayStation Overlay, similar to the Xbox Overlay, requiring a constant play connection.</p>



<p>Even worse, over 120 countries worldwide cannot purchase or play any game with PSN requirements. PSN isn’t supported worldwide, only in approximately 70 countries. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-until-dawn">What is Until Dawn?</h2>



<p>Did you play The Quarry? If not, I recommend scooping it up on Steam, especially with the upcoming Steam Summer Sale dropping prices to ridiculous lows. In any case, it’s a cinematic horror experience in which you control a group of characters as they attempt to survive the night from untold horrors in the darkness. It’s not a direct sequel to Until Dawn, but they share many similarities in style and gameplay.</p>



<p>Until Dawn follows a group of friends as they venture into the wilderness, hoping for a camping getaway at an isolated lodge. Unfortunately, they’re not alone. You’ll control individual group members, making life-or-death decisions along the way and changing the tale’s outcome with every choice.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 16 is on sale for only $35 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPMTJJ6D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1825606123847527313%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-16-is-on-sale-for-cheap-at-amazon-and-best-buy%2F1100-6519089%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. This matches the best price yet for the latest (brand-new) mainline entry in the series.</p><p>While every Final Fantasy game is different, Final Fantasy 16 takes the RPG roots of the series and injects a healthy dose of action into its design. The result feels like a mix between the action-packed spectacle of Devil May Cry and the RPG elements of older Final Fantasy games as you use a combination of swords and sorcery to defeat powerful foes.</p><p>This is also one of the darkest Final Fantasy entries, a game that wastes no time in setting up its stale of warring kingdoms, bustling slave trades, and cutthroat politics. All of this is seen through the eyes of Clive Rosfield, the protagonist who players will guide across a story that spans decades and charts his quest to bring balance back to a world that is in disarray. Don't worry if that sounds too much like Game of Thrones, because unlike that HBO series, Final Fantasy 16 has stunning boss fights between the Godzilla-sized Eikons that you'll encounter.</p><p>"Having seen Final Fantasy 16 all the way through, I'm happy to include it alongside some of my all-time favorites in the series," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/" data-ref-id="1900-6418081">Final Fantasy 16 review</a>. "It's heartening to see that this bold approach to both story and gameplay is now part of that legacy, expanding the definition of what a mainline entry could be. It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them. FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms."</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 is just one of many PlayStation exclusives on sale right now during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-2024-ps5-deals/1100-6523751/" data-ref-id="1100-6523751">Days of Play</a>.

<p data-characters="209" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Toys for Bob has announced <a href="https://x.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter</a> that they’ve teamed up with Microsoft for their next new game. There’s no word on what that next new game will be, but their choice of partner is… quite the choice.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xbox</a> to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit – but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜 <a href="https://t.co/6EqrQbabpv">pic.twitter.com/6EqrQbabpv</a></p>— Toys For Bob (@ToysForBob) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Toys for Bob was originally a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard and, along with them, were <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/uk-regulators-give-consent-for-microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought up by Microsoft in 2023</a>. It was only a few months before Microsoft went to work laying of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,900 employees</a>, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/toys-for-bob-future-unclear-amid-studio-closure-and-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some that were at Toys for Bob</a>, leaving the developer’s survival in question. Subsequently, Toys for Bob was able to split from the newly acquired Activision and set out on their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Since then, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft has shuttered</a> Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, while absorbing Roundhouse Studios into ZeniMax Online.</p> <p data-characters="547" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">I consider myself to be a forgiving person, but I’m confused that the studio is so eager to partner with their former existential threat. I shouldn’t be too surprised because, at the time of their split, Toys for Bob said in a statement that they were looking into a possible partnership with Microsoft. It may have been a part of the deal that allowed them to separate. Or perhaps they are working on a property owned by Microsoft. Or maybe they feel it’s a safe partnership because Microsoft no longer has the power to lay off their staff.</p>
 <p data-characters="626" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="false">Toys For Bob most recently worked on the <em>Skylanders </em>series, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spyro-reignited-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spyro Reignited T</a></em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>rilogy</em>, and <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time</em></a>. It’s possible that the developer is looking to return to one of those licenses, which would necessitate a deal with Microsoft. However, that’s purely speculation trying to make sense of the matter. We won’t know until the project is revealed. According to the Tweet, “We’re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit – but know that we’re working hard on an experience we’re so sooo inspired about! Can’t wait to share more.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-wear-and-tear-feature-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ea-sports-college-football-25-wear-and-tear-feature-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> challenges players to pick their spots and protect their players from taking big hits at all costs. Here is everything you need to know about the wear and tear feature and how to best avoid injuries. </p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">Wear and tear is a new feature in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, which accurately tracks the impact of every hit and fall on your players. For example, if your quarterback throws the ball 40 times in a game and takes a few shots from sitting in the pocket for too long, he won’t operate at 100 percent the following week. Or, if a running back takes a huge shot to his knee or lower leg, they won’t have the same explosiveness on the following set of plays. </p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, there is a way to mitigate wear and tear and prevent your best players from taking unnecessary damage that might potentially keep them off the field when they’re needed most. Lets jump right into how this feature works. </p>  <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cfb25-wear-tear-4-screens.png.adapt_.768w.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">As seen in the image above, every limb and body part of a player is linked to a different color indicator. Yellow is slight, high is orange, and severe is red. Based on the hits or fatigue from that body part, the color will change, and a meter in the bottom left indicates how close a player is to becoming injured. Fortunately, their body parts will degrade slower based on the toughness rating, and players can regain health when they are not on the field, during timeouts, at halftime, and between weeks. </p>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">To avoid injuries, users should regularly make substitutions to provide rest and prevent wear and tear. In addition, it’s always more fun to make an exciting spin move, juke, or hurdle over defenders, but you don’t always want to put your players in dangerous positions. So even though it’s not as flashy, sometimes running out of bounds or doing a safe catch might save your team for later in the season. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to check wear and tear</h2> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false">Here is a list of ways to check wear and tear in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. </p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Player reticle – Left side Wear and Tear bars, right side fatigue. Note, the bars depleting only represent the most hurt body part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Depth chart – Here, you can see a Wear and Tear panel on the bottom right of the player card as well as the total an attribute is decreasing in the spreadsheet.&nbsp;</li> <li>Coach Vision – Hold LT+RS on Xbox or L2+R2 on PlayStation down to see the Wear and Tear status of your entire team.&nbsp;</li> <li>Picture in Picture (PIP) in the play call menu.&nbsp;</li> <li>We’ve added a ton of ‘Wear and Tear’ get-up animations. After a player is banged up, you’ll see a variety of animations for a given body part, depending on the severity.</li> <li>You can also manage your players’ Wear and Tear in the Dynasty player card.</li> </ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-steam-survival-crafter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/soulmask-provides-yet-more-catnip-for-survival-crafter-lovers-on-steam.886527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-steam-survival-crafter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've got room in your life for another indie open-world survival-crafter, you might want to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>, which was released today on Early Access and which is climbing the Steam charts rapidly.</p>

<p>Earlier this week,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>publisher Qooland Games <a href="https://mask.qoolandgames.com/index/detail/144" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that the game's release would be moved from June 18th to May 31st, and it looks like that's a move which has paid off.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2646460/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s 24-hour player count has already reached a whopping 16,665, which is pretty impressive considering the game has only been on release for a handful of hours at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-pyramid.jpg?itok=cWBtgnQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-pyramid.jpg?itok=QxwcGdKR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>is taking the indie survival-crafter world by storm right now.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's numbers are even more impressive considering that the open-world survival-crafter market is arguably pretty saturated, with games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february"><em>Palworld</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-ashlands-update-ptr-launch"><em>Valheim</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-enshrouded-update-hollow-halls"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, and many others competing for players' time.</p>

<p>Qooland and developer CampFire Studio know that they need to keep people engaged if they want to build something sustainable, though, which is probably why the two studios delivered an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2646460/view/4191240933898301822" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early Access roadmap</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Said roadmap offers an "initial blueprint for the future" and promises a new map, new mounts and masks, and new gameplay features, plus lots more.&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>has some pretty ambitious plans behind it, apparently.</p>

<p>Given that we're not even into the weekend yet, it's likely that&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s numbers will increase even further over the next couple of days, so we could have another bona fide indie crafter hit on our hands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-flying.jpg?itok=UCn8JXXg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-flying.jpg?itok=Ii06FqyJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big things are in store for&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>certainly talks a big game. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646460/Soulmask/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> promises "more than 500 hours" of content in the Early Access version alone, spanning activities like farming, exploring, and, erm, "raising pigs". Hmm.</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>, you can do so right now via Steam Early Access. Can it make enough of a name for itself to stand out in a very crowded field? We'll have to wait and see, but early signs are pretty positive.</p>

Microsoft and Qualcomm aren’t talking much about this yet, but both companies have been dropping hints about game compatibility.</p><p>Qualcomm said previously that most Windows games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24107331/qualcomm-gdc-2024-snapdragon-on-windows-games">should “just work”</a> on Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and Microsoft took the time to demo some more games onstage at Build last week. <em>Borderlands 3</em> was shown running around 60 percent faster than native 1440p resolution thanks to Microsoft’s Auto Super Resolution technology. This taps into the NPU to boost frame rates and resolution, much like how Nvidia’s DLSS utilizes its own GPUs to upscale games.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161936/windows-on-arm-ready-software-linaro-microsoft-qualcomm">Microsoft also revealed</a> a new “works on Windows on Arm” website that catalogs which games work on Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite laptops. Linaro built the website and claims to have tested more than 1,400 games on the new Surface Laptop and other Snapdragon X Elite devices. More than 700 games are listed as running at 1080p and 60fps, including titles like <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>.</p><p>This all sounds rather promising for emulated games running on thin and lightweight laptops...</p><div>

			<p>Yesterday saw Sony roll out a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a>, and while opinions on such showcases always vary, it contained a fair number of announcements, including the ambitious new platformer <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>, first gameplay and a release-date for the multiplayer FPS <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>, as well as additional dates for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok PC port</a>, and more. So, is that it for Team Blue? Astro Bot, Concord, Silent Hill 2, and GoW Ragnarok on PC would make a solid lineup for the rest of the year, so maybe PlayStation returns to its cave to hibernate for the rest of the summer?</p>
<p>Well, apparently Sony isn’t done with the “E3 season” announcements just yet. According to reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midori</a>, we can look forward to info on “more titles from some SIE [Sony Interactive Entertainment] studios” at&nbsp; Summer Game Fest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">And more titles from some SIE studios too! 😊</p>
<p>— みどり (@MbKKssTBhz5) <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796320512081354980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Midori has one of the better track records in the leaking game, so if she says something, you should pay attention. As for what Sony might show, that’s up in the air right now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man 2</a> DLC seems like a fairly safe bet, as the big Sony leak from late last year revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-3-free-dlcs-carnage-other-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac has a bunch of plans for 2024 DLC</a> they haven’t officially revealed yet. Maybe we also get another little looky-loo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/marvels-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolverine</a>? Beyond the superhero stuff, perhaps we get another look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fairgame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairgame$</a>, and a first peek at <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstations-new-firesprite-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firesprite Studios’ horror title</a> or the rumored Lego Horizon Adventures (yes, a crossover between Aloy and Lego is a supposedly real thing that’s been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored by reliable sources</a>).</p>
<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show will stream live on Friday, June 7 at 2pm PT. What do you think Sony might bring to the big show? What are you <em>hoping </em>to see?</p>
