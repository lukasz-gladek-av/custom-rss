            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/criticdb-announced-beyond-traditional-aggregation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TechRaptor's very own Rutledge Daugette, along with several other members of the editorial team at our lovely little site, have announced CriticDB, a brand new review aggregator site that plans to "go beyond" traditional aggregation.</p>

<p>Rutledge describes <a href="https://criticdb.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CriticDB</a> as a "new video game review aggregation and game discovery platform". As you've probably guessed from that, it'll aim not only to aggregate professional reviews, but also to help you find games you might have missed.</p>

<p>At launch, the site will aggregate over 75 outlets' reviews (and that includes us here at TechRaptor, of course), and the team anticipates it will launch with more than 20,000 reviews across over 2,000 game pages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/criticdb-game-page-lies-of-p.jpg?itok=quPyEsCI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/criticdb-game-page-lies-of-p.jpg?itok=sepylObG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to check out over 2,000 game pages at launch on CriticDB.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Rutledge's brief, CriticDB puts three pillars at the center of its mission:</p>

<ul><li>Collecting reviews and previews from around the web</li>
	<li>Connecting gamers with games they might have missed</li>
	<li>Helping outlets and PR to connect more easily</li>
</ul><p>Rutledge also says he wants the site to be a "positive force in the industry", highlighting "great work and games" that may otherwise go unnoticed. The site is also geared towards its users; the point is to create a "community-driven" platform.</p>

<p>On CriticDB, you'll be able to browse professional and user reviews (although Rutledge says user reviews will only be submittable by those who subscribe to the paid Pro user tier), follow outlets and creators, and create lists with various different parameters.</p>

<p>Those lists include favorites, wishlists, and even played and beaten games, so it looks like CriticDB might also be gunning for the crowns of the likes of Backloggd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/criticdb-search-function-insert.jpg?itok=69Dilk6P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/criticdb-search-function-insert.jpg?itok=Gk88Z9KE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>CriticDB will feature a robust search function as well as plenty of user-centric features.</figcaption></figure><p>CriticDB users can create game pages for titles that are missing from the site's database, and they can also create links between similar games, helping other users to find games in their niche. Leaderboards will be available for users who create and link the most games, too.</p>

<p>Game pages consist of info like game release dates, listings for developers and publishers, and genres, as well as which platforms you can play the game on. Naturally, you'll also find CriticDB's signature "similar games" list, which will, if all goes well, have been at least partially curated by the site's community.</p>

<p>If you've ever found yourself wanting to find certain outlets, such as minority-owned platforms or independent sites, CriticDB will feature outlet tags to let you search for specific terms as well.</p>

<p>When it comes to the platform's future, Rutledge says the new site has a "robust roadmap" through which it will "expand...its features" throughout 2025. Some of the features coming to the platform include the following:</p>

<ul><li>An XP system and&nbsp;badges for profiles</li>
	<li>Outlet and&nbsp;author following</li>
	<li>On-site notifications for new releases of your wishlisted games and&nbsp;more</li>
</ul><p>If you're an outlet or a creator, you can also apply to be included on the platform when the <a href="https://criticdb.com/" rel="nofollow">review aggregation platform</a> launches on January 30th, so make sure you add it to your bookmarks for then.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>'s Adventure mode - a procedurally generated campaign that lets you approach the famously dense colony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> like a more traditional roguelite - is now out as a free update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/">on Steam</a>. The game represents perhaps the most cavernous, yawping blind spot in my entire pile of shame. I do own it, but I'm yet to play. I've already read a great deal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-basement-of-curiosity">extended wordery</a> on its merits - please, sell it to me in the comments in seven words or less. Here's a trailer:</p>

<p>Graham most definitely has played it though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dwarf-fortress-the-detailed-roguelike-thats-easy-to-play">calling</a> its older incarnation "a good way to experience the charms of its procedural world and high level of simulation". Personal anecdotes and experience are great and all, but what I really want is some deeply impersonal bullet-pointed features from a store page. Here are Adventure Mode's:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Go anywhere! Explore any civilization, earn a reputation, and recruit followers to join you</li>
<li>Experience your fortress and the simulation in a new, more embodied way</li>
<li>Explore mythical dungeons to find magical items, artifacts, and fill your quest journal</li>
<li>Hints of mythology and magic as a start of future simulation enrichment to come</li>
<li>An additional hour of music from Dabu and Simon Swerwer, presented as a second volume of the original soundtrack</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>As Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dwarf-fortresss-adventure-mode-getting-tutorials-and-more-direction-in-the-sandbox">covered here</a>, Adventure Mode sounds tailored for aspirant beardlings such as a myself, with a focus on tutorialisation and a more personal feel, since you only play a single character. Here's some further insight from co-creators Tarn and Zach Adams</p>
<blockquote><p>“In our earliest conception of the game you were meant to lose...  lose for a reason! Even before your fortresses existed in a huge procedurally generated world, they were destroyed and became haunted ruins you could explore in an RPG-style adventure. Years later, as our fantasy worlds have grown and become more complex, the Adventure Mode experience is so much more impressive.  Now the entire world is connected in ways you can actually see.  Visit the far off lands that send caravans to your fortresses, or seek out and slay the monsters that have troubled your dwarves before.  The extensive combat system only viewed from afar in Fortress Mode is now yours to use to inflict violence on your enemies...  or if you choose, travel the world and recite poetry to a room full of wombat men."</p></blockquote>
<p>W…wombat men, you say?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Call of Duty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">reportedly sold an "AI-generated cosmetic"</a> for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in late 2023, and fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">accused Activision of using generative AI again for a loading screen last year</a>. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">AI was "the very core" of its business</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/ja/topics/customers/capcom-generating-ideas-with-generative-ai?hl=ja" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Google Cloud Japan</u></a>, Kazuki Abe, a technical director at Capcom who has worked on huge titles like Monster Hunter: World and Exoprimal, explained how the company is experimenting with implementing AI in its game development processes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the most time-consuming and labor intensive parts of game development is coming up with hundreds of thousands of unique ideas,” Abe explained <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>(via Automaton</u></a>). He added that designs for things like televisions require their own unique designs, logos, and shape. “Including unused ones, we ended up having to come up with hundreds of thousands of ideas,” he continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple proposals are needed for the thousands to tens of thousands of these kinds of objects per game, and each proposal includes illustrations needed to communicate the idea to the art director and artists as well as text, Abe explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing room for efficiency improvements, Abe created a system where generative AI could read various game design documents and an AI could output the ideas, enhancing development speed and efficiency, delivering feedback for itself in the process and further refining output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His prototype, which taps into multiple AI models such as Google Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, and Imagen has apparently received positive feedback from internal development teams. The result of implementing the AI model would ultimately “reduce costs significantly” compared to doing them all by hand, while also improving quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, Capcom’s experimentation with AI models appears to be limited to just this system, leaving other aspects of game development, such as ideation, gameplay, programming, and character design firmly in the hands of humans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.

The hit mobile game is getting a much-needed content refresh later this month in the form of a new set called Space-Time Smackdown. Two separate booster packs will feature Dialga and Palkia on their covers, the legendaries from <em>Pokémon Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>. The set arrives alongside the addition of card trading, a long awaited feature <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957">we also just got some more controversial new details about</a></span>. </p><p>Space-Time Smackdown  goes live January 30. In addition to Dialga and Palkia, the set will feature other Pokémon new to <em>TCG Pocket</em>, including Lucario and Sinnoh region starters Turtwig, Chimchar and Piplup. A trailer for the expansion teased other cards and new illustrations for existing ones as well. There will seemingly be over 140 cards available from the new packs, making Space-Time Smackdown smaller than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809">starting Genetic Apex set, but twice the size of the Mythical Island set released in December</a></span>. </p><p>When it comes to trading, which will be added to the game on January 29, we already knew that players would be limited to exchanging cards at 1-star rarity and below. This was already rubbing players the wrong way, since crown rarity cards—like gold Charizard Ex—are the hardest to get and the only ones many diehard fans are still chasing. </p><p>Now, Creatures Inc. and DeNA have revealed the currencies players will need to trade with one another in addition to the rarity restrictions. The development team revealed players will need both trade hourglasses <em>and</em> trade tokens to exchange cards. Given current cooldowns, it certainly seems like this will limit players to just a few trades a week unless they spend money, though we still don’t know if or how <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s premium currency will factor into the new social mechanic. </p><p>Players also won’t be able to trade cards from First Space-Time Smackdown to start with either. The development team previously told fans it was looking at the negative feedback for the trading rules, but it doesn’t seem like it plans to change course anytime soon. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <li><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PS5</a></li>    </ul>

    
    <p><span>"Development is progressing smoothly."</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The untitled third entry in the&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> project, following&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> and&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Rebirth [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em>, is currently about nine months into development, according to director Naoki Hamaguchi. <span id="more-940012"></span></p><p>“Regarding the third game, we started working on it immediately after finishing <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>—around March or April 2024—so we’ve already been in development for about nine months,” Hamaguchi told <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/865/G086563/20250121053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer.net</a> in an interview for the release of the <a title="Platforms > PC [22,181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. “Our goal for 2024 was to solidify the gameplay experience we were aiming for with the third entry of the <em>Remake</em> project, and we put together a great build that aligns with the team’s overall direction and vision.</p><p>“Starting in 2025, we’ve entered the phase of building and refining the game based on the plan we’ve established, and development is progressing smoothly and at a good pace, following the schedule I initially laid out. I can’t say when I’ll be able to share more information, but please stay tuned.”</p><p>Producer Yoshinori Kitase added, “When it comes to large, story-driven <a title="Genres > RPG [16,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> projects, the pace of development depends heavily on whether the story itself is fully locked in. For the third game’s story, after I received the scenario from [scenario write Kazushige] Nojima, I asked him to give it a greater sense of completeness since this is the final game. We just wrapped that up a few days ago, so I feel that things are progressing smoothly.”</p><p>While <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> originally released on <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,613 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, sequel <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> released on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,694 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> without a PlayStation 4 version. Asked whether users can expect the third game to follow the trend of only being available on the next generation of consoles, Kitase laughed and said, “No, no, don’t worry about that next time.”</p><p>Earlier in the interview, 4Gamer.net asked Hamaguchi why the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> games have had staggered releases on PC, rather than launching day and date with their <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> versions.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Hamaguchi explained, “First off, the&nbsp;<em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [136 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> brand and franchise, and by extension, <a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, have built a very strong partnership with <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>. I strongly hope this continues going forward. However, it’s also true that we are no longer in an era where limiting the hardware on which you can play&nbsp; offers only substantial benefits. In fact, we’ve been seeing more and more cases where [Sony Interactive Entertainment]’s titles are being released for PC in addition to PlayStation 5.</p><p>“Through this&nbsp;<em>Remake</em> project, we also realized this shift, and have <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/square-enix-announces-new-medium-term-business-plan-square-enix-reboots-and-awakens-3-years-of-foundation-laying-for-long-term-growth">announced</a> as a company that we will be gearing towards multiplatform development. New [intellectual property] will be developed along these lines, so I personally believe it to be inevitable that console and PC versions will be released at the same time, or extremely close to each other, going forward.”</p><p>Later on in the interview, after Kitase’s comment about the third game not being exclusive to the next generation of consoles, Hamaguchi said,. “As I said earlier, going forward, [Square Enix] plans to release titles across a wide range of platforms so that more people can enjoy them. While I can’t make any promises at this point, we want our games to be played by as many people as possible, so we’ll do our best.”</p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> first launched for PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024. The PC version launched via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Funselektor and Strelka Games have announced Over the Hill, a new stylish driving game that takes the elegant presentation established in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/art-of-rally/" data-ref-id="5000-496661">Art of Rally</a> and applies it to offroading.</p><p>Officially stylized in all lowercase letters as "over the hill," this new indie racing game will hit many of the same notes as 2020's Art of Rally. That previous racer from Funselektor stood out in a sea of indie games because of its stylish presentation that stripped back all the fluff common in rally racing games. Its controls and car handling still felt authentic, like a simulation racing game, but Art of Rally plays from a top-down perspective and lets players drive through vibrant tracks. Over the Hill takes many of those design tenants and applies them to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game/" data-ref-id="5000-599973">MudRunner</a>-style offroad exploration game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> over the hill - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In Over the Hill, players explore different offroading locales connected by portals. It supports single-player and co-op with up to four player, and Funselektor populated each area with many challenges to complete and hidden collectibles to find. It won't always be easy to drive from one point to another, as players will have to account for Over the Hill's day-night cycle, dynamic weather, and other environmental obstacles that require tools to overcome. Over the Hill plays quite differently from Art of Rally, but Funselektor founder Dune Casu explained why the studio went this route for a follow-up.</p><p>"After having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace," Casu said in a press release. "In a way, this game is similar to the experience I've had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There's something special about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature, and less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2929250/over_the_hill/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Over the Hill</a> will launch on PC via Steam sometime in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-circana-us-sales-data-reveals-2024s-top-selling-games.1089882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US sales analysis group Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for 2024 as a whole, and you'll never guess which of the year's biggest releases topped the charts.</p>

<p>As ever, this data comes from Circana's Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dhbzzk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, and it crowns none other than&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>as the year's best-selling title.</p>

<p>That's not surprising given that Microsoft has called&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">the franchise's biggest yet</a>, but it will probably come as something of a relief given that the game was also made available <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">on Game Pass on day one</a>. Looks like that decision didn't do much to dampen its sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=dA1uCHGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=f442NDfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has, perhaps unsurprisingly, taken the crown of 2024's best-selling game in the US.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>'s performance will also doubtless come as a relief to Microsoft and Activision given how much the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets" rel="nofollow">series' budgets appear to have ballooned</a> in recent years;&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>really is too big to fail, so it'll be reassuring that this one didn't.</p>

<p>In second place on the all-format sales chart, it's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, which, again, won't come as much of a surprise given that the game recently swiped the crown of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">best-selling sports game in US history</a>.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>, which was sitting at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">12 million sales at last count</a>, takes third place, while the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>takes fourth place.&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>is in fifth.</p>

<p>In terms of platform-specific charts, it's a tussle between&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>for PlayStation and Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>topping <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2djbuyk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sony's chart</a> and&nbsp;<em>College Football&nbsp;</em>reaching number one on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dkxnp22n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft's</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=Bn96CzFP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=DUTTzKXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold remarkably well.</figcaption></figure><p>Since neither game was released on the Nintendo Switch, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>College Football 25&nbsp;</em>are completely absent from Nintendo's table.</p>

<p>Instead, it's topped by&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>taking up second place and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>in third.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>really is unstoppable, eh?</p>

<p>You can check out Piscatella's full Bluesky thread, which begins with data specific to December 2024 then widens up to encapsulate the whole year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. As always, it's worth a look if you're a numbers nerd!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Don't Nod's Lost Records: Bloom & Rage Part 2 Delayed By a Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nods-lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed-by-a-month.1089879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don't Nod has delayed the second part of upcoming adventure game <i>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i>. The game's second chapter is now set to launch around a month later than its originally-intended release date.</p>

<p>In an FAQ answering questions about&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, Don't Nod says the delay was put into effect in order to give the devs time to "refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling". It sounds like the usual delay reasoning, by and large.</p>

<p>The studio says that it's "confident" the delay will allow it to "provide you with a richer experience", and that it has "a little something up [its sleeve] on social media to keep you entertained in the time between the two Tapes" (i.e. chapters).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=MXcUjlpo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=v_Hv5wXx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>'s second part will be delayed by around a month.</figcaption></figure><p>The second part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, which is also known as "Rage",&nbsp;is now set to arrive on April 15th. This delay won't affect the first part (also known, surprisingly enough, as "Bloom"), which is still set to launch on February 18th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>is, Don't Nod's FAQ explains it pretty succinctly: it's a "single-player experience focused on narrative exploration" that revolves around four friends confronting the dark secrets of something that happened to them 27 years ago.</p>

<p>You'll be able to navigate between the 1995 and 2022 timelines and "shape both narratives" as you go, uncovering the truth of the sleepy Michigan town of Velvet Cove and what may or may not lie beneath its surface (spoilers, though: something definitely does).</p>




<p>This isn't the first time the game has been delayed in some form or another. <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>was originally set for release in 2024, but back in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Don't Nod pushed its launch back to 2025.</p>

<p>The studio will no doubt be banking on&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>' success for two reasons: to offset the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">recent underperformance</a> of some of its games and to launch what is supposed to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-by-life-is-strange-devs-is-first-game-in-much-larger" rel="nofollow">wider universe of interconnected media</a>.</p>

<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first part is due to arrive on February 18th, and the second will be released on April 15th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/celeste-devs-cancel-next-game-earthblade-due-to-studio-disagreement.1089843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Celeste&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Towerfall&nbsp;</em>studio Extremely OK Games has revealed that its ambitious Metroidvania platformer&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled owing to an internal studio dispute.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official EXOK website titled "Final&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>Update" (just in case you weren't absolutely sure the game was done), the studio describes the cancellation as "a huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". EXOK head Maddy Thorson says the decision to cancel was actually made in December.</p>

<p>According to Thorson, a "fracture" began forming in 2024, with her and coworker Noel Berry on one side and art director Pedro Medeiros on another. Specifically, the dispute revolved around "the IP rights of&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>", and it's a dispute Thorson says she "won't be detailing publicly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=VVIxJQhI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=MB3WBn6G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ambitious-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>The dispute, which Thorson calls "a very difficult and heartbreaking process", was eventually resolved, but she and Berry eventually agreed to go their separate ways with Medeiros, who originally announced his departure from EXOK <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Thorson says that the dispute with Medeiros caused her and Berry to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>and ask themselves whether continuing its development would be "worth the pain". Together, they concluded that working on the game had become "exhausting", leading them to "admit defeat".</p>

<p>She also goes on to say that fans shouldn't blame Medeiros, and that he and the team on his game&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>"aren't the enemy". Treating them as such will make you unwelcome "in any EXOK community", she says.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it was an exploration-based action platformer that would have offered "seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart".</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-revealed-as-new-game-from-celeste-developers" rel="nofollow">revealed in 2021</a>, EXOK announced in early 2024 that&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/celeste-creator-earthblade-delayed" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming out that year</a>. It's very likely the studio had already begun to grapple with the problems that would cause the game's cancellation even then.</p>

<p>As for what's next for EXOK, Thorson says the goal now is to "wipe the slate clean" and to "refocus...back to smaller-scale projects". We'll have to wait and see where that goes in future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> recently celebrated its first anniversary, and to mark the occasion developer Pocketpair outlined its plans for the game's second year, with a roadmap that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">co-op crossplay and an "ending scenario"</a>.</p>
<p>But, why add an 'ending' now? Could it be because of Nintendo's impending legal action against the game? Well, Pocketpair community manager John "Bucky" Buckley tells Eurogamer this 'ending' has actually been "mapped out for quite some time" - and even though it is on its way, it certainly doesn't mean this is 'the end' of Palworld.</p>

<p>"The World Tree, where the 'ending' takes place, has been visible since day one," Bucky tells me. "Many players suspected their journey would end there, and we've been asked repeatedly about when the World Tree will become available so we're pretty excited to finally be opening the area up for players!"</p>
<p>Bucky admits "ending" may not actually be the best way to phrase things, but says he "can't think of a better one" right now.</p>
<p>"While the World Tree will mark the conclusion of this particular journey, it's by no means the end of Palworld," he assures.</p>
<p>As for what else is still to come in Palworld, Bucky promises "exciting things" in the pipeline. "We might have announced the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> collaboration a bit prematurely," he admits, "but everyone, including Re-Logic, was so excited that we thought it'd be fun to share early!"</p>
<p>Pocketpair remains "really excited about the direction [its] headed", Bucky continued, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">Pocketpair's newly-announced publishing division</a> "which aims to fund and support developers in creating cool games".</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, Palworld's first year has not been without its challenges.</p>
<p>"There were so many challenges, to be honest," he tells me. "Pre-launch, we started gaining traction online, which was new for us and brought its own difficulties. Post-launch, we faced server problems, bug reporting issues, countless accusations... It was a lot to handle.</p>
<p>"While those issues haven't entirely gone away, they've definitely become more manageable."</p>
<p>Those accusations mostly came with a Pokémon-flavoured edge to them. Before the game was released in early access last January, many dubbed it 'Pokémon with guns' due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-hides-an-unreleased-familiar-looking-pal-creature-in-its-code-fan-says">familiar designs of some Palworld creatures</a> and some in-game mechanics. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit is targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ss_4c403dcd22f20a11524269c71f9feec96085a762.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Pocketpair</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, what has the team learned from the last 12 months? After all, no one - even Bucky - expected Palworld to take off quite as much as it did. As a reminder, Palworld became the first big mega-hit of 2024, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam last January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p><p>"As a company, we've learned how to structure our processes better," Bucky tells me. "People often forget that Pocketpair is quite a small team. The methods we've used for our previous games worked well, but Palworld put a spotlight on both our weaknesses and strengths. This year really brought the team together and made us more effective in our workflows."</p>
<p>But, for Bucky personally, he now appreciates the "importance of asking for advice and help as soon as possible" adding: "There are so many incredibly knowledgeable people in this industry."</p>

			<p>Despite being a pretty big fan of the Disgaea franchise, I’ve never dabbled in the other strategy RPG releases that team has concocted over the years. Nippon Ichi Software has a massive catalogue of different titles to dig into, though, which also makes it so surprising that it took this long for the company to put out a sequel to something other than Disgaea. It’s been over twenty years since the original Phantom Brave came out, having been ported and remastered a few different times since that initial release. For a select group of dedicated fans, Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the chance to finally experience a new adventure in this world. As someone who never played the original, though, I was equal parts excited and cautious to see how much this game would differentiate itself from that far-too-familiar Disgaea formula.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero – Gameplay Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Knv_DXvub0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I was also definitely concerned that hopping into the sequel to a game I never played would leave me with more questions than answers, but Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is incredibly easy to dig into as a newcomer. For one thing, the game’s intro does a good job of quickly introducing you to series protagonists Marona and Ash – a young girl who has the special ability to see and communicate with phantoms – and a phantom named Ash who has sworn to protect her at all costs. Very soon after introducing them to you, though, Marona and Ash are separated due to a mysterious attack, with Marona waking up on an unfamiliar island all alone. She soon meets a lonely Phantom girl named Apricot, whose father was the leader of a massive pirate crew before going missing. Tangled up with Apricot and searching for Ash, Marona ends up involved in a web of swashbuckling adventures as she sets out to help her new friend and find her old one.</p>


<p>I appreciated the way Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero balances the tone of it’s writing. I’ve come to expect zany, fourth-wall-breaking anime shenanigans from Nippon Ichi Software, but there’s a somewhat softer and more heartfelt vibe to this game. There are still silly jokes and weird characters, and literally every time Apricot is on screen I can’t help but laugh at how anxious and overwhelmed her portrait art looks. The themes of loss and death and family run deep in this game, though, and I appreciated that the macabre of it all isn’t entirely ignored – there’s a constant clash with the fact that you’re going on silly fun adventures with ghosts and then being reminded that these fun new friends are ghosts and have died, and the game takes the time to explore and unpack all of that in a way I really appreciated.</p>


<p>Phantoms aren’t just a thing for the sake of silly ghost jokes, though. Their existence (or lack thereof) is a major element of the combat in Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero. Battles take place in small SRPG style maps, but with the familiar square-grid movement replaced with full dynamic movement around the map within a certain range. Protagonist Marona can’t do much by herself in any of these maps, though – but using her Phantom abilities, she can confine the ghostly friends in her party into any object on the map to give them a physical form. A Phantom who gets confined to an object will also get buffs or stat modifiers or new abilities depending on the object.</p>
<p>It’s a simple concept that quickly expands out in an overwhelming amount of ways. Some objects are linked thematically, and Phantoms confined to linked objects share those linked stats. Some characters can summon weapons and mechs called Gadgets that you can confine into to unlock extra attacks. Marona can even use Confriend to fuse with a Phantom on the field, changing her character model and giving her a few turns of ultra-powered action. The depth of the Phantom system is really impressive, and combined with the free movement it creates an entirely different battle flow and priority focus than in usual SRPGs. Positioning is key, but now so is environmental item awareness and managing your Phantoms time on the field efficiently.</p>

<p>It took a long time for the battles in Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero to feel less overwhelming and more open-ended. In part, the way the game tutorializes and introduces you to the various mechanics at your disposal leaves a lot to be desired – the official English website for the game has a better on-boarding tutorial for the combat system than the game itself. Once things settled in and started to click though, it was so satisfying to almost stumble accidentally into really effective and surprising strategies. In one instance, I had a barehanded Phantom near a strong enemy, and thought to throw a powerful weapon from one of my allies to that unequipped Phantom – and it worked, letting me equip that thrown weapon onto them and deal with that enemy instantly.</p>
<p>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero does an excellent job of differentiating itself from the vibe and mechanics that the Disgaea franchise has made so familiar. It asks a lot of you in the beginning, but once you wrap your mind around it all, this ends up being one of the most inventive and original strategy RPGs I’ve ever played.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-expands-mod-support-for-baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3.1089807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-expands-mod-support-for-baldurs-gate-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced a collaboration with Larian Studios and mod.io to expand mod support for Baldur's Gate 3 on GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>As you will likely remember, the cRPG added built-in cross-platform mod support thanks to mod.io. Baldur's Gate 3 mods <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods-expand-party-size-unlock-level-cap-add-spells-feats-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been a thing on PC</a> even during the early access phase thanks to the old-fashioned way, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since last September</a>, there has been an official modding tool and a mod manager available within the game that players can access.</p>
<p>Thanks to the aforementioned partnership, GeForce NOW users subscribed to the Ultimate and Performance tiers can now download the mods via the in-game menu and keep them enabled across sessions, which is obviously the biggest problem with cloud gaming since you always get a different remote PC when logging in for a new session. Alternatively, GFN users may subscribe to the mods via mod.io to load them automatically when launching the game from GeForce NOW. Not all mods will be available at first; it will start with mods that have been curated for consoles. However, NVIDIA said to stay tuned for expanded support coming specifically for the game's PC mods in the future.</p>
<p>Improved support for mods and add-ons appears to be a long-term goal for NVIDIA with GeForce NOW. A while ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-world-of-warcraft-addons-to-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added support for World of Warcraft add-ons</a>. We'll see if this trend continues with other PC games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs.1089801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has revealed that it's opened a publishing wing, and that its first game will be a horror project by&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios.</p>

<p>The partnership was announced earlier today in a <a href="https://x.com/PocketpairPBLSH/status/1882352824731980211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, wherein Pocketpair describes Surgent as "a studio with an original approach" and pledges to support the studio "to the fullest extent".</p>

<p>While this is Pocketpair's first publishing signing, it won't be the studio's last; the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dev tells fans to "look forward to future announcements for details of specific projects", so we're going to be seeing more Pocketpair-published games in future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pocketpair-palworld-tales-of-kenzera-zau-publishing-next-game.jpg?itok=BnWEcCFq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pocketpair-palworld-tales-of-kenzera-zau-publishing-next-game.jpg?itok=MjE3-mJ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair is stepping up to publish&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent's next game.</figcaption></figure><p>Over on the new Pocketpair Publishing <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the studio says its mission is "simple": to "find fun games" and then "help make those fun games a reality".</p>

<p>Pocketpair pledges not to tell indie developers "what to do", not to "take control" from them during the making of their games, and not to "change [their] dream or push [them] to make a certain type of game".</p>

<p>Instead, the studio simply wants to "give [developers] money" and "help [them] make a fun game". That sounds nice and simple to me, although it's notable that Pocketpair doesn't disclose the share it'll take of developers' revenue or other terms along those lines.</p>

<p>As for the next Surgent project, studio head Abubakar Salim says that it won't be set in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>universe and that it will be based around "a pattern in the entertainment industry". It'll also be "short and weird", according to Salim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=IG_TiTGZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=U7WO8bcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll likely see more Pocketpair Publishing projects in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a nice redemption story for Surgent Studios; back in October, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow">put its team "on notice for redundancy"</a>&nbsp;following the underperformance of the game (although we now know it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">not the only EA-published game</a> to have underperformed in recent months).</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait a little while to see what Surgent's next project looks like, and we don't know whether Pocketpair will indeed be publishing more games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera&nbsp;</em>universe, but for now, it looks like Surgent has been granted a reprieve. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update finally has a release date, and it's coming just a day before the game's next major expansion set arrives.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the trading update, which will allow you to trade cards with your friends (albeit with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-details" rel="nofollow">pretty hefty caveats</a>), will arrive on January 29th, which is next Wednesday at time of writing.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the trading update will only let you trade with friends, and only certain cards will be supported to begin with. Additionally, you'll only be able to trade cards of certain rarity levels, and new items will need to be used in order to facilitate trades.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=EqhDLw6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=Ls5PaGcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion will bring plenty of new cards for you to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, you'll only be able to trade cards from the first two sets as well, those being Genetic Apex and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>. Plans are in place to introduce trading for other sets at a later date, apparently.</p>

<p>As for the new expansion, it's called&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown</em>, and as the name suggests, it'll largely revolve around two of the Sinnoh region's pivotal legendary Pokemon, namely Dialga and Palkia. The new booster packs will be themed around those Pokemon as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new Pokemon from Sinnoh that haven't appeared in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>before; The Pokemon Company is teasing Lucario and the three Sinnoh starters (Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup), but there will likely be others, too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the new set also teases a Pachirisu ex card that includes attack text referring to Pokemon Tools, a mechanic from the main&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>game that can augment certain 'mon attacks. Sounds like they'll be making their debut with this set as well.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update launches on January 29th, and the&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion set launches a day later on January 30th. Make sure you're ready for both!</p>

It seems as if there will be cooldown periods as well as a cost if you want to swap cards from Pocket’s Genetic Apex and Mythical Island sets with other players. But there will <em>definitely </em>be some waiting involved for people hoping to trade Space-Time Smackdown, which will not be tradeable until a later date after it drops on January 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
