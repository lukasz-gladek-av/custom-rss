<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159180/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in May 2014. We're updating and republishing it in honour of the game's arrival on Switch 2 as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-gba-game-ranked">the Nintendo Classics GBA lineup</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Starting life on the PlayStation in 1997, at a time when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> had just brought the gaming world triple-jumping headlong into the era of 3D platforming, Namco's Klonoa series has always done things differently. Klonoa's first outing, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/klonoa_door_to_phantomile">Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</a>, was a pioneering foray into 2.5D, mixing polygonal backgrounds with sprite-based characters, and restricting movement to a two-dimensional path while letting the path itself wind its way enchantingly through a three-dimensional world.</p>
<p>It was breathtaking then and continues to captivate today, as Nintendo gamers discovered with the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/klonoa">Wii remake</a> in 2008. But Klonoa's earliest appearance on a Nintendo system was back in 2001, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a> for the Game Boy Advance. Given that one of the series' defining features is its innovative use of 2.5D, does this fully two-dimensional performance manage to capture the charm of Klonoa's original adventures? Absolutely, and in the process, Empire of Dreams delivers one of the finest puzzle-platforming experiences found anywhere.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159178/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Rabbit, cat, or both? Klonoa's species is never really explained, and isn't worth fretting over; in-game, he's referred to simply as a "Dream Traveller". Empire of Dreams' story revisits the series' staple theme this time in the Kingdom of Jillius, where an insomnia-stricken emperor has outlawed dreaming within the realm. Naturally, Klonoa runs afoul of this law and is tasked with ridding the kingdom of various monsters to atone for it. Told through mostly static cutscenes, the story is charming and more engrossing than you might expect, and backed up by wonderfully engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>The main hook of the series is that Klonoa can use a short-range "Wind Bullet" from his ring to lift enemies above his head, inflating them in the process in a visual homage to Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/dig_dug">Dig Dug</a>. From there, he can hurl them at other enemies or throw them towards the ground mid-jump, leapfrogging over them to perform his signature double-jump.</p>
<p>It feels great, and re-imagining enemies as stepping stones rather than strictly obstacles makes for a very different kind of platforming experience. It means that just moving around the levels (or "Visions" as they're called here) involves light puzzling elements, and collecting the three stars, plus 30 optional gems that require creative use of Klonoa's skills and puzzle-solving prowess.</p>

<p>Barring some head-scratchers in the later areas, these puzzles are never difficult. But they're not designed to stump you. Rather, they're meant — like Klonoa's central double-jump mechanic — to engage you in your surroundings, and to encourage full use of the environment. By design, Empire of Dreams is a game that invites you to enjoy the little things.</p>
<p>An array of different foes and environmental elements are introduced as you progress, bringing new puzzle-solving techniques with them and making each world feel fresh in gameplay as well as visual style. The level design is fantastic throughout, and keeps a strong sense of forward momentum even when there's backtracking involved. It's very difficult to get lost, and since enemies and objects respawn automatically, you'll never be stuck having to restart a Vision.</p>
<p>The main puzzle levels are broken up by two faster-paced stage types, with both forced-scrolling platforming and side-view hoverboarding sequences thrown into the mix. Yes, Empire of Dreams hails from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2</a> era, when every mammalian mascot worth their salt added some sort of extreme board sport to their résumé, but Klonoa feels like he comes by his hoverboard honestly. These stages are a lot of fun, and collecting all 100 optional gems requires quick thinking, split-second jumps, and likely a lot of replay. The forced-scrolling levels in particular are beautifully designed, easy enough to complete without being frustrating, but with gems placed tantalizingly just out of reach so that you're always tempted to risk squeezing in another double-jump or potentially deadly detour.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159186/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Even as an early Game Boy Advance release, Empire of Dreams looks wonderful, making excellent use of the system's impressive 2D capabilities. Sprite scaling and rotation add real personality to Klonoa's foes, environments, and boss battles, while parallax scrolling brings the multi-layered backgrounds to life. Animations are beautiful, the sprites are charming, and the bright colour palette — which thoughtfully lent itself to easy viewing even on the non-backlit first generation Game Boy Advance — shines brilliantly. The visual themes in the different worlds also skip the usual platformer clichés of fire, ice, and so on, and are much richer for it; the opera house-themed second world is a real highlight.</p>
<p>The soundtrack was a standout feature of both Klonoa's console outings, and this portable version lives up to their musical legacy, albeit on a smaller scale. The loops are shorter, but the series' trademark sound is still here in spades, with catchy melodies lilting over the action and often evocative of the wind mentioned in our hero's Japanese name (<strong>Kaze no Klonoa</strong> - "Klonoa of the Wind"). The impressive voice samples included are also a treat, and Klonoa's trademark <em>"Wahoo!"</em> adds a gleeful sense of triumph to every double-jump.</p>
<p>Empire of Dreams has 40 Visions spread out over its five worlds, and while it's not a lengthy game by today's standards (you could easily beat it in a weekend), the focused stages are perfect for quick trips into Klonoa's world. You can return to previously cleared Visions at any time, and there are extras to be unlocked by collecting every gem in every level, which significantly extends the replay value for ambitious players.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159187/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The restore points afforded by the Wii U's Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online (plus the latter's rewind function) are largely unnecessary, given the game's save system and relatively short levels, but the emulation extras are handy additions.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Game Boy Advance was blessed with an enviable and nearly endless parade of platformers over its lifespan, and this game stands out as one of the very best. With thoroughly satisfying mechanics and more charm in the opening stages than many games manage by the closing credits, Klonoa: Empire of Dreams is an absolute joy and well worth revisiting.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed Klonoa's big screen adventures, you'll love Empire of Dreams both for the same reasons and for its distinct, pocket-sized personality; if you've never had the pleasure of taking a trip with Namco's fuzzy Dream Traveller, this is a wonderful place to start.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-portal-mode-gameplay-ea-battlefield-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-portal-gameplay-appears-online-shows-just-how-far-the-editor-can-be-pushed.1309014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-debuts-battlefield-6-campaign-trailer/">we got our first look at the campaign mode</a> in Battlefield 6 during Sony's State of Play presentation. Today, gameplay from the upcoming Portal mode in Battlefield 6 has appeared online, and it's a major showcase of just how far players will be able to push this new Portal.</p>



<p>If you're unfamiliar, the Portal in Battlefield 6 is where players can access other player-made game modes and levels that drastically change everything about what it is to play Battlefield 6. It's a full-blown creative mode where you can make seemingly anything you can think of using assets and models already in Battlefield, and this year's version of it seems to be more expansive than ever before.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer for the mode from EA and Battlefield Studios that was <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1971228205387317485">posted to X (formerly Twitter)</a> shows a bit of what this new tier of level-crafting potential looks like, with quick shots of the editor and how granular players can get.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6RGo76uyTk&amp;t=5s">YouTuber JackFrags</a> shows off some of the Battlefield Studios-made modes that really show off how you can just create whatever you want in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. Want to recreate Counter-Strike? Check. Want to create your own Battlefield version of Call of Duty Zombies? Check. Want to make a version of Only Up where you're competing against other squads to race to the top and hold that position? Check. Racing F-16s, creating your own conquest maps, re-drawing out-of-bounds lines, adjusting every detail of the gameplay experience? Check.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Portal Gameplay and Impressions..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6RGo76uyTk?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's far more freedom than we've seen in previous Battlefield games, and while the modes created by Battlefield Studios shown in the video are just a few of the more obvious options (like a Zombies mode or racing vehicles), you can only imagine the kinds of modes players will make once they get their hands on it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to find out, as Battlefield 6 arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming October 10, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ananta-anime-gta-spider-man-rip-off-clone-trailer-2000628763</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-anime-gta-clone-is-ditching-gacha-but-not-being-shy-about-ripping-off-spider-man.1309011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s the saying, “good artists copy, great ones steal.” And then there’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-mugen-ananta-anime-rpg-open-world-gta-trailer-1851714840">whatever <em>Ananta</em> is doing</a>. The upcoming open-world RPG from NetEase developer Naked Rain is going viral again thanks to new footage from Tokyo Game Show 2025. While it might look like the latest round of <em>Genshin Impact</em>-inspired <a href="https://kotaku.com/zenless-zone-zero-hoyoverse-rpg-project-mugen-anime-1850772023">mobile anime slop</a>, the developer has confirmed it won’t be relying on exploitative gambling mechanics to earn its keep. It will, however, be ripping off <em>Spider-Man</em> in every way it can.</p> <p>First, let’s start with the new trailer. Released earlier this week, it shows seven minutes of gameplay depicting all the ways you can explore, fight, and hang out in <em>Ananta’s</em> urban playground. Taking the reins of special agents patrolling the streets for strange anomalies, the new footage is almost a greatest hits highlight reel of all the past games the upcoming mobile release is pulling from, including not just<em> Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em> but also<em> Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Sifu</em>, and more. There’s fluid martial arts brawls and smartphone hacking games. And of course, there’s the web-singing people have been gawking at since the game was first announced.</p>  <p>It looks neat, and it’s impressive this is a game designed for mobile devices and not high-end consoles. Naked Rain is promising multi-level exploration from the ground-level streets to city rooftops, as well as interiors you can explore at different elevations. There are vehicles you can get in and drive, weapons you can pick up off the ground, from guns to golf clubs, and NPCs who will supposedly react to whatever chaos you’re causing while out exploring. “Every choice ripples through the life of the city,” the developers write. We’ll see.</p>

 <p>For some players, this is a win-win-win. Steal one game mechanic and you’re a thief. But take a bunch from all different games, pour them into a blender, see what comes out, and you might be a genius, or at least someone with the potential to make NetEase a lot of money. For others, however, <em>Ananta</em> is a bit <em>too</em> “shameless” when it comes to ripping off the competition. It’s not just that you can web-swing around town like Spider-Man, it’s that you can also use Venom-like powers to smash bad guys with attacks that look straight out of<em> Spider-Man 2</em>. <em>Uncharted</em> didn’t invent quick-time events, but some of these chase scenes look really on the nose.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This Ananta game has no shame 😅<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Uncharted4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Uncharted4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaughtyDog?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NaughtyDog</a> <a href="https://t.co/ly53Bi6Ebi">pic.twitter.com/ly53Bi6Ebi</a></p> <p>— King J 🤴🏿 (@JMaine518) <a href="https://twitter.com/JMaine518/status/1971228406328250840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marvel's Spider-Man 2: The Anime… I mean, ANANTA looks absolutely incredible!

One other big thing going for it is that, unlike a lot of games in this space, <em>Ananta</em> won’t be hocking pay-to-win character loot boxes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-whales-hoyoverse-gacha-gambling-spending-1849734889">also known as gacha mechanics</a>, in order to make money. Naked Rain confirmed <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53241">to <em>Famitsu</em></a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gta-style-open-world-anime-game-ananta-will-not-have-a-character-gacha-system-netease-confirms/"><em>Automaton</em></a>) that the game’s monetization will instead rely on cosmetics and other customizable features ranging from outfits and cars to the player’s house.</p> <p>It’s not the only post-<em>Genshin</em> Impact mobile RPG to be shifting away from gacha mechanics. The makers of<em> Duet Night Abyss,</em> which arrives on mobile next month, announced they too <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/a-gacha-rpg-is-cutting-all-the-gacha-garbage-so-it-can-just-be-a-better-game-were-completely-removing-all-character-and-weapon-banners/">would be ditching</a> the hero loot box grind and getting rid of star ratings for equipment to limit pay-to-win mechanics. It’s also doing away with stamina limits, another popular way for nickel-and-diming players on mobile. “In the last test,” DecaBear says, “[Testers] said our gameplay–which is built around fast-paced grinding–kept getting blocked by stamina limits,” producer DecaBear said. “And that felt pretty bad.”</p>

While its arrival is welcome, Gearbox warned console players that increasing the FOV past the default could cause some dips in performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Graeme Timmins had flagged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-its-prioritizing-the-first-round-of-buffs-over-patching-out-instakill-knife-builds-but-it-will-eventually-address-unintended-interactions">Gearbox was more interested in buffing than nerfing Borderlands 4 in the short term</a>, leaving broken builds alone for the time being. And today's update reinforces that approach, with no nerfs to speak of. Indeed, Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to say Gearbox had too many buffs to fit into today’s update, so it broke them up into their own balance update that’s due out early next week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update also includes fixes for the high-profile memory leak issue for Borderlands 4 on console, which causes the framerate to degrade the longer you play. But there’s more to come. “We believe we've made significant improvements there, but we're still investigating data to make sure any remaining issues continue to be resolved,” <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971251482692669832" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timmins explained</a>. “We're confident that today's update makes a big difference though, and we're excited to get feedback/data on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance improvements on PC are also welcome. Borderlands 4 is still on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 3 is not in any plan developer Arrowhead has right now, the studio’s CEO has confirmed. Instead, it wants <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> to keep going for years and years, like veteran MMO RuneScape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jagex’s fantasy MMO RuneScape began life as a browser game an incredible 25 years ago. It’s had over 300 million accounts since, and is still going strong today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, rather than follow Helldivers 2 with Helldivers 3, as the video game industry would perhaps expect, Arrowhead wants to follow RuneScape’s lead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-boss-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-a-forever-game-like-runescape-that-can-keep-improving-with-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani clarified the studio’s plans in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420521613207535647" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Discord</a>. “We have no plans for HD3,” he said, “just HD2 for as long as it can go. Think RuneScape.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of a Helldivers 3 had come up recently when Jorjani said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-a-destiny-style-social-hub-for-helldivers-2-its-on-the-feature-list-for-the-next-one-dev-says">a social hub space like the Tower in Destiny was “on the feature list for the next one."</a> But he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified</a> that he was talking about Arrowhead’s next game, not a Helldivers 2 sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His latest comment is consistent with prior statements on the studio’s plans. Jorjani has in the past said Arrowhead hopes to build upon Helldivers 2 to such an extent that it basically becomes a Helldivers 3, but that was clearly figuratively speaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Myself and the directors agree we would love this to be a forever game,” Jorjani added in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420498034395054172" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another Discord post</a>. “Assuming we get a grip on the performance and dev practices we can keep expanding it for a long time. PlayStation is super supportive.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Review Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jorjani’s comments shouldn't come as a surprise. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab"><u>The studio has indicated it plans to support Helldivers 2 for years to come</u></a>, and only recently launched the Sony-published game on Xbox Series X and S and the Into the Unjust update, which added Hive Worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">Helldivers 2 production director Alex Bolle told IGN</a> "we want it to be around for years and years and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are?" he continued. "And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while Helldivers 3 isn’t happening, more Helldivers stuff very much is. In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Sony announced that <u>Helldivers 2</u> was being adapted into a film</a> as part of a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures. No other details were offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. Check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review-update-now-on-xbox-series-xs"><u>review of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X and S</u></a> to see what we think of the game as it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

So far, we know the open-world racer. Although developer Playground Games won’t be revealing gameplay until early next year, it does (unsurprisingly) tease Tokyo and the countryside surrounding Mt.

<p>Finally scoring on Switch this November</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's that time of year again when Level-5 reminds us all that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> is a real game, and this time, there's even a brand-new trailer to boot.</p>
<p>The repeatedly delayed football RPG will <em>finally</em> be arriving on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>13th November</strong>, and today's Tokyo Game Show trailer gives us the lowdown on everything that we can expect.</p>
<p>Now, sure, the footage that we see this time isn't particularly different to that which we've been shown before, but in Level-5's defence, we have been tracking this one for a long time at this point.</p>
<p>The new trailer is only available in Japanese for the time being — the caption states that English subtitles will be added "at a later date" — but there's still plenty of gameplay to check out. We get a good look at the game's OTT training minigames, special-ability-based matches and nostalgic 'Chronicle Mode'. There's even a touch of town building-esque pitch customisation thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>It has been a long time coming, but we'd be lying if we said that we weren't a little bit excited for this one to finally kick off in November. Let's just hope that the release date sticks this time.</p>

              <p>We still have a few other holidays to get through before the big ones at the end of the year, but you can get excited for them now with this LEGO Star Wars advent calendar. Truly, I can’t thing of a better brand to be making advent calendars for the holidays. Small, surprise LEGO builds are the perfect little toy and activity to be greeted with each day while counting down to Christmas. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4308/">This Star Wars one is normally priced at $45, but for a limited time you can scoop it up for 16% off</a>. That brings the price down to just $38, saving you a cool $7.</p>
<p>This LEGO Star Wars advent calendar is new for 2025 and will transform December into 24 days of fun for any Star Wars fan six years old and up. The set includes a very specific choice of iconic characters across the franchise. You won’t find Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, or Prince Leia here.

C-3PO is there of course but you also get droids like R7-A7, BD-72, a scrap battle droid, and a super battle droid. BB-8 is adorably dressed up like a snowman and there is a Jawa that comes with a holiday sweater.</p>

<h2>Let Star Wars Make Your Holiday Special</h2>
<p>Maybe sometime along the way of this 24-day countdown with you new LEGO advent calendar, you make some time to checkout the infamous <em>Star Wars Holiday Special</em> of which most involved wish it to go away. The CBS made-for-television broadcast is set after <em>A New Hope</em> but before the yet-to-be-released&nbsp;<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>. It follows everyone’s favorite Wookie Chewbacca alongside Han Solo venturing to return to Chewie’s home planet of Kashyyyk to celebrate “Life Day.” After its first airing it had never been broadcast again nor re-released in any official capacity. It’s not good and is the right choice to make this LEGO advent calendar have nothing to do with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians"><i><span>The Guardian</span></i></a><span> is reporting that Microsoft has cut off the Israeli military’s access to the technology that it has been using to conduct surveillance on phone calls in Palestine. According to the report, the Xbox company told Israeli officials that the military’s spy agency, Unit 8200, violated its terms of service by “storing the vast trove of surveillance data in its Azure cloud platform.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This follows </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"><span>previous </span><i><span>Guardian</span></i><span> reporting</span></a><span> from August on how Azure was being used to store Palestine communications, as Israel had been surveilling civilian phone calls in Gaza and the West Bank. Following the report, Microsoft had an external investigation conducted into its relationship with Unit 8200, which led to the cancellation of the unit’s access to its cloud storage and AI services. You can read the </span><i><span>Guardian</span></i><span>‘s story for more of the minutiae, but the long and short of it is that this is a huge win for both the employees and external forces that </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5518786/microsoft-protesters-office-israel"><span>have been calling for a boycott</span></a><span> of Microsoft due to its relationship with the Israeli government, as it continues its ongoing attacks on the people of Palestine. Microsoft was </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox"><span>added to the BDS Movement’s boycott list</span></a><span> earlier this year, with the movement calling the company “perhaps the most complicit tech company in Israel’s illegal occupation, apartheid regime and ongoing genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza.” This included calls to cancel subscriptions to Xbox Game Pass, as well as boycotting games like <em>Candy Crush</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>, which are all owned by Microsoft’s various studios. We’ve reached out to the BDS Movement for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <p><span>Brad Smith, the Vice Chair &amp; President of Microsoft, sent an email to employees that was published </span><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/"><span>on the company’s blog</span></a><span>, in which he cited </span><i><span>The Guardian</span></i><span>’s reporting as the catalyst for this decision.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian’s reporting. This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services.</span></p> <p><span>We therefore have informed IMOD of Microsoft’s decision to cease and disable specified IMOD subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies. We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians.</span></p> <p><span>As I said at our recent employee townhall, this does not impact the important work that Microsoft continues to do to protect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East, including under the Abraham Accords.</span></p> <p><span>I want to note our appreciation for the reporting of The Guardian. Its reports were based in part on sources outside Microsoft that had information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments. This helped inform our review.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>While this is a victory, as both Smith and </span><i><span>The Guardian</span></i><span> note, Microsoft still </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft"><span>has other longstanding relationships</span></a><span> with the Israel Defense Forces, which include access to certain tech and services. But this is the first example of a United States company pulling its resources from Israel since the war with Gaza began. </span></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades 2</a> has officially launched in full, and the day-one patch notes reveal just how far the game has come since it started its early-access journey. Currently available for PC and Switch consoles, the 1.0 version of Hades arrives with a substantial number of changes to the game, ranging from minor tweaks to new additions that'll keep you exploring the Underworld for hours on end.</p><p>Some of the biggest highlights here include the true ending of the game, so if you want to see how Princess Melinoe's story really concludes, you'll want to go give Chronos a good kicking. Supergiant Games added that this ending will not change key events in the game, and earning it will unlock the final Vow of Rivals rank. Getting to that ending is quite the achievement, and one that will be celebrated with some digital kudos, as 50 different achievements have been unlocked as well.</p>

      </div>
<p>You do not need to start the game over to earn any achievements, so once you load it up, you may be pleasantly surprised to find these retroactively added to your account. Players can also expect new artwork--like visual effects, environmental art, and other visual improvements--new music to listen to, more decorations to liven up the Crossroads, and even more Keepsakes to collect. Beyond that, there are scores of tweaks to virtually every part of Hades 2, from combat to character animations and much more.</p><p>If you feel like scrolling through the lengthy patch notes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512967793587520047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can click this link to read</a> about every change, big and small.</p><p>"Hades 2 exits early access as a finely-honed and deeply engaging roguelite that builds upon the strong foundations established by the first game," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review</a>. "It's larger in every way, with more characters and conversations to enjoy, an entirely new roster of weapons to learn, and deeper customization options to its expanded combat system, yet none of these upgrades compromise Hades' legacy. Rather, Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel that is essential to play."</p><p>If you're looking to dive into one of the best games of 2025, you can check out GameSpot's guides on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-best-endgame-build-tips/1100-6534896/" data-ref-id="1100-6534896">best Hades 2 endgame builds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-soot-where-to-find-wake-up-hypnos-soundest-of-sleepers/1100-6534788/" data-ref-id="1100-6534788">where to find soot to wake up Hypnos in Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-melinoe-seek-us-riddles-where-to-locate-three-fates/1100-6534873/" data-ref-id="1100-6534873">where to locate the three Fates in Hades 2</a>.</p>

                <p>A major new patch for Borderlands 4 has arrived, adding the promised field of view (FOV) slider on console, making stability and performance improvements, and tweaking some rewards and progression elements.</p><p>It's a beefy patch, but it's not the end of Gearbox's ongoing support, as the developer also said there were "too many" buffs for Vault Hunters to fit into this update, so these changes are coming in their own balance update that is <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">targeting release early next week.</a> That said, this newest patch does indeed contain Vault Hunter changes and balance adjustments for Harlowe the Gravitar, Amon the Forgeknight, Vex the Siren, and Rafa the Exo-Soldier. You can see the specific changes in the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes below</a>.</p><p>Since Borderlands 4 launched earlier this month, players on console and PC have complained about stability and performance issues, and this patch addresses both of those concerns. It also addresses instances of crashes, hitching, and low FPS. Gearbox said it's work continues and it will make "further improvements to stability and performance" in the future.</p><p>For the FOV slider on console, Gearbox said people should know that increasing the FOV beyond the default settings may cause "dips in performance."</p><p>The technical issues with Borderlands 4 prompted Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">post through it</a>, but he's since moved on to <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1970925490556002363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting a lot about the upcoming Now You See Me movie sequel</a>.

"In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the screen is smaller, so there is less space to work with. Crafting every screen became a little puzzle we had to solve," he said. "With</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we were working with NES-style constraints, which gave us a lot of structure."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has fewer limitations in some ways, so we had to invent more of our own rules. That actually makes it harder, because more freedom means more choices!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Velasco, Making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">wasn't just about building a new kind of retro game—it was also an adventure in adapting to the new possibilities of Kickstarter in 2025.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dream-casting-and-finding-character-with-your-own-voice-unlocking-the-vault-2" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dream-casting and finding character with your own voice - Unlocking the Vault #2</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter can be a major marketing tool in 2025">Kickstarter can be a major marketing tool in 2025</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the developers, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the largest game they have made to date. The success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its spin-offs gave the team the runway to move forward with their project. However, as Velasco elaborated, their second attempt at a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yachtclubgames/mina-the-hollower">Kickstarter campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> helped them further expand the vision and build an audience for a game that is quite different from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The game is not entirely funded through Kickstarter. It was a portion of the budget, but it was also a marketing and community-building tool," said Velasco. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">[crowdfunding] campaign went really well. It funded quickly, created a very enthusiastic community, and we even got to work with backers directly through things like "Director for a Day," just like we did back in 2013. It was very rewarding to experience... It was also much easier to fulfill rewards this time compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ten years ago, when we overpromised and were literally packing boxes of dirt ourselves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Kickstarter has always been a place where niche audiences can make projects happen," he said. "Retro-inspired games fit perfectly there. They may not always have mass appeal to convince a big company to fund them, but crowdfunding shines a spotlight on them and helps them break into the mainstream. Today, retro game nostalgia is a big business, but we still approach it from a very indie place."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/nintendo-spells-out-why-player-communication-should-only-happen-in-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo spells out why player communication should only happen in-game</a></p><p>Image via Yacht Club Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Yacht Club Games ventures into a top-down action-RPG in the vein of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Oracle of Ages/Seasons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the Game Boy Color. Focusing on the plucky Mina, who wields a variety of weapons and can burrow underground to overcome foes and puzzles, she explores an island in mass turmoil as invading armies spread their corruption. The core loop leans into the structure of the Legend of Zelda series, but there's a heightened focus on exploring moody, atmospheric zones filled with different combat encounters. Different scenarios demand different tactics and careful use of Mina's arsenal to overcome them. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was modeled closely after classic 8-bit side-scrolling games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DuckTales </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ninja Gaiden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has an entirely different pace and flow, moving away from traditional stage progression to a more seamless overworld with towns and dungeons to uncover.

With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the top-down view resembles a classic RPG or action-adventure so that players might expect exploration, dungeons, and interconnected systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In both cases, as developers, we are playing with player expectations.

It has involved combat, hundreds of items that interact with one another... a giant overworld that can be explored in any order, and more!

<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b35a35cf5a1c/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: GungHo Online</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53444">Famistu</a> has published the latest weekly physical charts in Japan, and while a handful of new releases have changed things up a bit, the line-up is still <em>largely</em> the same.</p>
<p>At first glance, you'll notice that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> remains on top, selling a further 33,861 copies. But last week's new release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a>, takes both second and third place, with the PS5 version <em>just</em> edging out the Switch release (physically at least) by 58 copies.</p>
<p>But, if you combine both the PS5 and Switch copies sales, that makes Trails in the Sky the biggest game in terms of sales this week, which is impressive. For those wondering, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> is digital-only, so that won't appear on the list.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067stnxhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remains steady, shifting another 11,300 copies — some consistent numbers right there. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/gallery-unboxing-superdeluxes-castlevania-advance-and-dominus-collections-on-switch">Superdeluxe's gorgeous</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> rounds out the top five, selling just under 10k copies.</p>

<p>Switching to the hardware side of things, the Switch 2 unsurprisingly remains up top. After surpassing the 2 million mark in Japan last month, it's sold a further 40,711 units, far outselling any other console this week.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 SKUs have sold a combined 21,660, compared to the PS5's combined 8,384, a pretty significant drop for Sony's console compared to last week, while the Switch remains relatively consistent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's yet another GeForce NOW Thursday, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-mecha-break/">a new batch of games announced</a> as joining the ever-growing library of games available to stream through NVIDIA's cloud service. This week, 10 games are joining the cloud library, while two games already available get a boost by officially becoming streamable with NVIDIA's new RTX 5080 graphics cards powering them.</p>



<p>The highlights in this week's batch of new GeForce NOW games include Mecha Break from developer Amazing Seasun Games, with the multiplayer PvPvE title joining the service with support from DLSS 4, letting you enjoy the 3v3 or 6v6 matches at high frame rates.</p>



<p>Other highlights come from new indie titles on the scene, including Baby Steps, a game from the makers of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. Baby Steps released earlier this week on September 23, after the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">slightly delayed it in order to get out of the way of Hollow Knight Silksong's launch</a>.</p>



<p>If you've not heard of Baby Steps before, it's a physics-based hiking game where you take control of a 35-year-old man-child in a onesie. You control each of his legs separately, and find yourself on a treacherous hike while winding your way through a story that is as weird as it is hilarious. It was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Wccftech's highlights at a Steam Next Fest earlier this year</a>, and the demo is still available if you want to try it out before jumping in.</p>



<p>Another highlight in this week's batch is the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy collection, which includes all 14 episodes from the first three games. </p>



<p>As for the two games that can be played through NVIDIA's new RTX 5080 graphics card, those titles are Remedy Entertainment's excellent Alan Wake 2, and GSC Game World's Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to GeForce NOW this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aztecs: The Last Sun</li>



<li>Baby Steps</li>



<li>CloverPit</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2</li>



<li>Lost Right</li>



<li>Mecha Break</li>



<li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Precedessor</li>



<li>Renown</li>



<li>Sworn</li>
</ul>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-dying-light-the-beast/">13 games joined the cloud library</a>, including the new Claws of Awaji DLC for Assassin's Creed Shadows, Dying Light: The Beast, Jump Space, and Two Point Museum.</p>

            <p>Vroom. Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom vroom. Ahem, sorry, dunno what happened to me there. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> EVO, the three-letter-yelling follow up to one on Steam's long-reigning top <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">racing sims</a>, has just gotten its third early access update. It adds in online multiplayer, plus a bunch of fresh cars and tracks to hop into moments before you're unceremoniously punted off by a random.</p>
<p>I've been playing a bit of a waiting game with AC EVO since <a href="https://www.vg247.com/assetto-corsa-evo-feels-like-worthy-heir-to-steam-racing-titans-so-far-but-lot-of-laps-to-go">yapping about it at length for my old home</a> when it first debuted in early access at the start of this year, but this might be the point I hop behind its wheel agaion and see how devs Kunos Simulazioni have managed to flesh it out so far. After all, they've now added in a 90s Merc 190E, which is pretty much square German saloon kryptonite for my will to hold off on checking things out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Booting the gas to commence my rundown of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3058630/view/543369627969782128?l=english">update 3's inclusions</a>, the headliner's AC EVO's first step into multiplayer via a new mode that lets you hop into races against up to 16 other players who'll no doubt be polite enough not to use your rear bumper as their brake. These races are held in free in-game servers, which run 24/7 and will have the sort of variety of race scenarios, tracks, and weather settings you'd expect to pick between.</p>
<p>A portal for custom servers is said to be coming soon and those are paid, something that hasn't gone down well with players to the extent it looks to be a key factor in the EVO's Steam reviews currently sitting at mixed. In terms of what they cost, a 20 or more slot server that's live 24/7 for 30 days will be €15 plus VAT, while renting a server with unlimited slots for just a day will cost €5. There are discounts if you opt to rent a server for longer periods, those being three, six, or twelve months. It's a controversial way of monetising things for sure, especially for a game that's still in paid early access.</p><p>Beyond that, update 3 brings nine new cars: three GTs, three special racers, and three road cars. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2, and Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport are the GTs, the Caterham Seven Academy Racer, Dallara Stradale, and the Ferrari F2004 F1 car that a certain Mike Schumacher drove are the specials. Finally, the road cars are the Audi RS 6 Avant, BMW M3 Sport Evo (E30), and that Merc 190E Evo 2 I mentioned earlier. New tracks-wise, Belgian rain magnet Spa and energy drink road the Red Bull Ring have arrived.</p>
<p>When fire them up, you'll likely notice a few other new additions like revamped car audio, a recalibrated tyre simming model, and graphical tweaks which bring in global illumination, optimised CPU/GPU performance especially for bigger grids and "significantly reduced VRAM usage"</p>
<p>So, hopefully less stuttery vroom vrooms when jumping into these new online races. Tell the first road rager who cheekily spins you out and then speeds of sniggering like Dick Dastardly I said hi.</p>

			<p>Let It Die: Inferno is a new rougelite-survival game from developer GungHo Online Entertainment a the next game in the Let It Die series. Announced during yesterday's Sony State of Play event, it'll arrive on PC and PS5 this coming December 3, 2025.</p>



<p>Let It Die: Inferno is a PvEvP title that will constantly have you doing whatever you can to survive as you try to work your way towards the legendary 'Eye of the Reaper' treasure that can give whosoever finds it immense untold power.</p>



<p>You'll search for it by descending into the Hell Gate, plunging into its depths for this treasure to hopefully be the last one standing with it. On top of dealing with the creatures and demons you'll find on your way to the treasure, you'll also have to contend with other players in this third-person action roguelite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Within the Hell Gate, all bests are off,</em>" writes Allyson Nicholas, associate community manager at GungHo Online Entertainment, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/survival-action-roguelite-let-it-die-inferno-launches-december-3-on-ps5/">a PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>In order to survive, players must not only fend off grotesque creatures and human enemies in melee-focused combat, but also other players. It's rougelite survival action in a chaotic PvEvP environment. Upon each descent, your Raider will be equipped with a character-specific weapon</em>, <em>which can be switched out with any weapon you find as you explore. All Raidrs are dual-wielding and the combination of weapons in your equipment slots will unlock new special attacks. Needless to say, no two playing experiences will be the same; stage layouts and item placements shift every descent, so players must use a strategic combination of unique weapons and special abilities to make it out alive</em>."</p>



<p>The last time we saw the Let It Die series was with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathverse-let-it-die-will-be-redeveloped-service-to-be-suspended-on-july-18/">free-to-play title Deathverse: Let It Die</a>, which was taken offline in 2023 to be "<em>redeveloped</em>" into something new. Well, GungHo Online Entertainment doesn't directly come out and say that Let It Die: Inferno is that redeveloped title, but that could very well be the case.</p>



<p>Regardless, at least Let It Die fans won't have to wait too long to check out Inferno with its December release date, and while it might not be free-to-play, it is only costing you $24.99 to jump in.</p>

I came across it in yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IndieFanFest">Indie Fan Fest</a> stream, and I quite like the cut of its torpedo bays.
</p>
<p>
Nullspace grabs me for a couple of reasons. One is its "retrofuturistic universe", which strikes me as both sleek and cosy. It's kind of <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/39LP0B">chibi Homeworld</a>. The kitbashed ships come alive with swivelling turrets and manoeuvring jets, but something about the way they're proportioned, patterned and lit also makes me think of freshly piped cake icing. I also quite like the Star Fox-style jabbering heads of unit commanders in the bottom corner.

<p>
The other thing I like is that this is one of those possibly borked genre hybrids, like Shiny Entertainment's Sacrifice or Activision's old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlezone">Battlezone</a> reboot. On the one hand, it's a real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> with planetary bases, various resources to gather, a choice of fleet formations, and the option of either using asteroids for cover or blowing them up for disruption. On the other, it's a dogfighter, with the ability to seize control of any ship and hose the badniks with your own two thumbs. 
</p><p>
The result may prove to be more akin to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> or a punch-up in an Airfix factory than the Battle of New Caprica. There are a couple of moments in the trailer when ships barge into each other like shopping trolleys. But I do like the bustle of it all. 
</p>
<p>
There's a story to reckon with, when you're not making battleships kiss. It channels both "the Golden Age of Sci-Fi" and "deep existential themes". According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2363280/NULLSPACE/">the Steam page</a>, you will "lead or challenge factions like the democratic Hegen, the transhumanist Dominion, and the resourceful Junkers as they vie for survival and dominance." Apparently the game contains a "unique take on the Fermi Paradox", this being the contention that we really should have run into some advanced extraterrestrials by now given the amount of stuff there is in outer space. Interested to learn more, I guess.
</p>
<p>
As for those factions, they put me a little in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a>, though they don't seem quite as vicious. Here's the blurb in full:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>The Junkers: Survivors and scavengers, the Junkers live on the fringes of space, salvaging remnants of humanity's past to build a precarious future. Their resourcefulness and ingenuity allow them to adapt to any situation, but their distrust of centralized authority makes them fiercely independent--and difficult to unify.</li>
<li>The Hegen: A powerful, militaristic faction rooted in discipline and order. The Hegen values tradition and hierarchy, believing that humanity's salvation lies in strict control and unwavering loyalty. Their massive fleets and technological prowess make them a force to be reckoned with, but their rigidity may blind them to alternative solutions.</li>
<li>The Dominion: Visionaries, innovators, and seekers of progress, the Dominion is driven by the belief that humanity's evolution lies in embracing new ideas and technologies. They see opportunity in the chaos, pushing boundaries to forge a brighter future, though their relentless pursuit of advancement often clashes with the values of other factions.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>
All told: I can dig it. But do I dig it more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>? I can see representations of gravity wells in the trailer, there, but I doubt it's simulating quite as much stuff. Nullspace hath yet no release date beyond "coming soon".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A generation of Nintendo fans grew up playing the <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> on GameCube at every sleepover. And now this slept on kart racer’s franchise is finally coming back. It’s kind of crazy that the Nintendo Switch 2 is only getting a small handful of exclusive titles this year and two of them are kart racers. I guess Mr. Sakurai—director of the <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> games and creator of Kirby—really just wanted to see his pink ball back in the driver’s seat of a warp store and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/">Nintendo said “Fine.”&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders </em>is now available for pre-order over at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>The first <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> had a limited roster, just letting you race as different colors of Kirby. You could unlock Meta Knight and King DeDeDe, but they did not allow the option to choose your machine.&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is fixing that by giving you a huge new cast of racers — all of which have full access to the different machines to race on. Choose between Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, Chef Kawasaki, and so many more characters. Each racer has their own unique special move they can unleash to give them the edge in a race.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The machine choices have greatly expanded, but lots of fan favorites are returning. the speedy Turbo Star, the slippery Slick Star, and the intimidating Rex Wheelie are all back. New machines such as the heavyweight Battle Chariot are looking to be a fun time as well.</p>
<h2>City Trial Is Back</h2>
<p>Real fans of <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> know that the heart of this game is not in the racing modes. No, sir. You play this game for one thing and one thing only — City Trial. This multiplayer free roam mode is back in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> and it’s looking to be better than ever before. Zip around the floating city known as Skyah as you have minutes to find a good machine, collect power-ups and upgrades, then compete against up to 16 players online in a random field event. These could be standard races, battles to the death, darts but on karts, and so much more.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/">You can pre-order either the physical version or a digital code which you can enter into your Nintendo Switch 2 to install on release.</a> The game is set to release later this Fall on November 20. Pre-order today for $70. Remember before pre-ordering that this title is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 and will not run on your old, standard Nintendo Switch console</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

                <p>Over the last couple of years, developer Insomniac Games has earned critical acclaim for its work on Marvel's Spider-Man series. Following two main Spider-Man games and the Miles Morales game, the studio's next project is one that has Marvel fans excited as a legendary mutant is stepping back into the spotlight.</p><p>The last time that Wolverine had a solo game was all the way back in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. A tie-in game to the film of the same name, Raven Software's single-player adventure was a gruesome and action-packed spectacle of blood, guts, and adamantium claws. More than a decade later, Insomniac's take on the X-Man is looking like a spiritual successor, and while the game is still deep in development, a few new details about Marvel's Wolverine have been revealed recently.</p><h2 id="When_will_Marvel_s_Wolverine_be_released_">When will Marvel's Wolverine be released?</h2><p>As revealed during the September 2025 State of Play, Marvel's Wolverine will be popping its claws in Fall 2026. </p><p>Insomniac is something of a miracle worker when it comes to video game releases, as since 2018, the studio has shipped Marvel's Spider-Man, expansive DLC for the game, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, with Spider-Man 2 launching in October 2023. Insomniac has a reputation for surprisingly short development cycles in the current era of multi-year game projects, and it has been suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-will-be-m-rated-game-could-launch-as-early-as-fall-2024-report/1100-6511117/">Marvel's Wolverine could launch in Fall 2024</a>. That didn't happen, of course, and most recently, Insomniac <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-dev-refuses-to-comment-on-2025-release-date-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement/1100-6528944/" data-ref-id="1100-6528944">refused to comment when asked if Wolverine is coming in 2025.</a></p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_platforms">Marvel's Wolverine platforms</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Marvel's Wolverine will be headed to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive, given Insomniac's position as a PlayStation first-party studio<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-sony-bought-insomniac-games-we-felt-that-this-/1100-6469237/" data-ref-id="1100-6469237"> since its acquisition by Sony in 2019</a>. It's highly likely that the game will eventually come to PC, as several other Insomniac-developed titles have also wound up on that platform following their PS5 release.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_gameplay">Marvel's Wolverine gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQXgLjwdM98" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sQXgLjwdM98" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wolverine isn't the kind of hero who wins a fight with quips and hugs, and naturally, Insomniac wants to create an experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-trailer-reveals-2026-release-window-and-very-bloody-gameplay/1100-6532076/" data-ref-id="1100-6532076">that feels fast and ferocious</a>. The studio says its aiming to create "the ultimate Wolverine fantasy" and enhance that vicious combat with action-packed set pieces and a gripping story. The first gameplay trailer hinted at this savage side of Wolverine, as the X-Man was using his adamantium claws to impale enemies, rip them apart, and brutally dismember them.</p><p>As for the tone of the game, Insomniac is aiming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-will-be-full-sized-and-mature-in-tone/1100-6496210/">deliver a mature experience</a>, which is fitting considering Wolverine's nature as a walking weapon. Insomniac's recent games have also been showcases of slick action, so there's a good chance that the studio will deliver some cutting-edge gameplay with Wolverine that's balanced by the developer's ability to dig deep into the emotional core of its characters.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_story">Marvel's Wolverine story</h2><p>Insomniac isn't sharing too many details on what the storyline for Marvel's Wolverine will be, but the studio did tease that it will be original take on the character to uncover the secrets of a dark past that has eluded him. </p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_actor">Marvel's Wolverine actor</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6cSbKIwGWQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P6cSbKIwGWQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To bring Logan to life, Insomniac recruited Australian actor Liam McIntyre to voice the character and provide motion capture for him. McIntyre has a long list of acting credits, and he's best known for playing the lead role of Spartacus in the TV series Spartacus: Vengeance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s Monster Hunter mania at this year’s Tokyo Game Show, with Capcom giving over a huge amount of floorspace to every version of Monster Hunter currently out there, from the mainline Wilds and crossover events in Final Fantasy XIV, through to the upcoming mobile title <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-outlanders-preview-what-if-this-is-the-best-monster-hunter-of-2025/">Monster Hunter Outlanders</a>. The next big release for the franchise, though, is Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection - Release Date Trailer | TGS 2025 Extended Cut" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkJ1qtTPRZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The third entry in the turn-based RPG spin-off turns monsters, or Monsties, into rideable pals, fusing Pokémon-style collecting with a slower-paced take on Monster Hunter’s inimitable style and genre-defining combat. It’s a spin-off that’s earned plenty of accolades, and with Stories 3 it looks as though Capcom have created the best entry yet.</p>


<p>So much of the game’s appeal stems from its visuals. The anime-inspired art direction is effortlessly appealing, and here it feels closer than ever to Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a>. That’s no bad thing, and when it’s combined with the unique armour designs and iconic creatures of the Monster Hunter universe, you’ve got one of the best-looking anime-style games in recent memory.</p>


<p>As a JRPG, there’s a far greater focus on storytelling than you’ll find in the mainline series, and that means more conversation, more world-building, and more characterisation. Luckily for us, we got to experience a good portion of the game during our hands-on at TGS. You’re Captain Leo, a prince of the kingdom who’s sworn to lead a group known as the Raiders. Alongside Simon, rookie Thea and Felyne pal Rudy, you set out to find the truth in a foreboding prophecy, in a world where various species are going extinct, and the kingdom is on the brink of war.</p>
<p>We got to play the demo build on Switch 2 in handheld mode, and I was initially concerned whether Capcom had been able to iron out the performance issues that plagued Monster Hunter Stories 2 on the original Switch. Thankfully, it seems that frame rate issues have been hunted into extinction, though I think it’s running at a more modest 30fps rather than the PS5’s 60fps. Still, for a turn-based game, that makes very little difference, and the exploration felt smooth and issue-free. Oddly, the only place where I thought I caught a couple of stutters was during cutscenes, but with these outside gameplay, and kinks should be ironed out before launch in March next year.</p>
<p>Three games in, the fundamental combat system remains in place, with you and your Monstie fighting alongside a companion and their creature. There’s three different types of basic attack, with Power, Technical and Speed attacks each holding sway over one other. If you end up in a head-to-head and you’ve picked the more powerful attack, then you’ll cause extra damage, and avoid taking any yourself, though if you get it wrong, you’ll be punished accordingly. It promotes learning each monster’s attacks and weaknesses, and it’s a clever way to bring across a facet of the mainline games.</p>

<p>It doesn’t stop there. As you fight, you build up Kinship with your Monstie. You do that just by fighting alongside each other, but you can amp it up with Double Attacks, where you and your monster have chosen the same type of attack. Once you’ve charged your Kinship, you can leap onto your monster pal and then unleash a Kinship attack that’s both graphically rewarding and massively damaging. Fundamentally, that’s the core loop of battle.</p>
<p>The demo featured a small selection of easily recognisable monsters, starting with the fodder of Velociprey, before increasing the difficulty with the Velocidrome and a Paolumu. Through the demo you saw the importance of focusing on attack types, and working with your Monstie in order to dish out the most damage.</p>
<p>The close of the demo showcased the final form of that, with you facing off against a Feral Chatacabra. Feral creatures have been afflicted by some kind of growth – haven’t they always? – and you have to think through which part of the animal to attack, and when.</p>
<p>Choosing the wrong time and the wrong part results in a vicious counterattack, so you have to bide your time before trying to remove the growth from its back. In the meantime, it covers its forearms in a different substance, and if you then aim for those limbs, you can topple it over, giving you and your teammate the chance to unleash a Synchro Rush, once again hammering it and its health bar.</p>
<p>Whether the additions to the turn-based combat make all that much difference remains to be seen, and in some ways, it’s just kicking the can a little further down the road. I do hope that the overall difficulty is a little higher than the previous games, or that there’s the option to make it more challenging from the off, so that veterans and turn-based fans can really get the most out of it. That said, it does exactly what you want, which is give you more Monster Hunter Stories.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is the obvious next step for the series. That’s taking the graphics and the turn-based action up a notch, while expanding the world of Monster Hunter into newfound territory. The previous two games have given fans a totally different take on the mythology and magic of the series’ iconic creatures, and on early impressions alone, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection looks as though it’s going to carry on that tradition.</p>

<p>We're zwei-back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_zwei_remake">Panzer Dragoon Zwei: Remake</a> is alive and well, and currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/panzer-dragoon-zwei-remake-resurfaces-will-be-playable-at-tgs-2025">playable at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>. And while the press (and eventually public) are going hands-on with the game, publisher Forever Entertainment has shared the gameplay footage for the upcoming remake for the first time.</p>
<p>That's... kind of amazing, given that Zwei: Remake was announced back in 2018. Forever Entertainment has basically been radio silent on it since then, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">Panzer Dragoon: Remake</a> and various <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission Remakes</a> have been released since then.</p>
<p>Anyway, for those who have played the 1996 Sega Saturn rail shooter <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/panzer_dragoon_ii_zwei">Panzer Dragoon II Zwei</a>, things will look pretty familiar, though everything has been given a new lick of paint.</p>
<p>The footage is all from Episode 2, the name of the second stage of the game, featuring combat mostly from the ground (there is plenty of flying in game, so don't worry).</p>

<p>Some comments on the video do share some concerns, such as the size of the dragon's wings and the design of the boss at the end. And Forever Entertainment doesn't exactly have the best track-record, with the first game's remake getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">an average review from us</a>. Still, we're glad this sequel is still kicking and we hope to see more of it very soon.</p>
<p>Panzer Dragoon Zwei: Remake is coming to Switch at some point — there's no release date yet, but we'll be sure to tell you all about it as soon as we know.</p>

Then oh boy, does Xiaomi have the phone for you.</p><p>Today it announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785693/xiaomi-17-pro-max-china-launch-specs-price-second-screen">flagship 17 series phones</a> in China, led by the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max (any naming similarity to Apple is resolutely <a href="https://weibo.com/1892653244/Q4EeinmG4"><em>not</em> a coincidence</a>). Those two Pro models mostly stand out for the inclusion of a second screen on the back, which stretches across the wide camera island. It can be used to frame selfies, set timers, and control music playback, but all I can think about is Xiaomi’s official accessory to convert the phone into a ratchet Game Boy.</p><p>The ¥299 (about $40) Retro Handheld Console Case includes four face buttons, a circular D-pad that looks more like an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design">iPod Click Wheel</a> than anything else, and a 200mAh battery that Xiaomi says should deliver 40 days of gameplay, at three hours a day. It even comes with <em>Angry Birds 2</em>.</p><p>The sole downside — apart from what I can only assume is an incredibly awkward, cramped gaming experience ruined by the two lenses on the screen — is that you can’t use the phone’s wireless charging while the case is in place.</p><p>No word yet on if, or when, the 17 Pro phones will launch in Europe or anywhere else outside China, but let’s hope the retro case comes with them when they do.

              <p>Good morning and good day. I’m very busy right now, so let’s not waste any time and get right to today’s news. Welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. This time we’ve got info on a big <em>FBC</em> update, news on multiplayer in the <em>MGS3 </em>remake, and some other stuff, but I’m very busy and…yeah, okay, cool. Bye.</p> <h2><strong>Remedy is trying again to relaunch its failed co-op shooter</strong></h2> <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-remedy-co-op-fomo-live-service-preview-1851771133">FBC: Firebreak</a>,</em> Remedy’s co-op shooter released earlier this year, hasn’t been a big hit for the studio. While I enjoyed it for a few days, the game failed to hook me due to finicky menus, frustrating progression issues, and other complications that made it hard to enjoy with friends. Since launch, Remedy has spent a lot of time fixing and improving the game. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426">Now, as announced in a Steam post on September 25</a>, the studio is releasing a massive free content update that will change <em>FBC</em> in some big ways.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte/app.bsky.feed.post/3lznz3jf2wo2y" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreialowfft3zs2hlowkpcwh6mttkp6u4rh2fmwzw4ujmspttjwsqtqe"> <p>Our 1st free Major Update to FBC: Firebreak launches on September 29th. Breakpoint brings with it systemic overhauls, new content, and quality-of-life improvements. </p> <p>Read our latest blog post for all the details (it's a big one): https://bit.ly/BreakpointFBCFirebreak </p> <p>#FBCFirebreak</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte?ref_src=embed">Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte/post/3lznz3jf2wo2y?ref_src=embed">2025-09-25T13:01:03.362358702Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>The new update, named “Breakpoint,” is launching on all platforms on September 29. Perhaps the biggest change in this new update is the removal of the Job Board. It’s being replaced with a Crisis Board that fills up with randomly generated missions with various modifiers. The idea is to make <em>FBC</em> more replayable, surprising, and chaotic. To help with that, Remedy is also adding more variety to missions, new weapons, and fresh enemies to kill or be killed by. I’m also excited about the changes to progression, which will simplify some parts, making it easier to get cool guns and have fun, but will also add more customization options for weapons as players spend more time completing missions.</p>

 <p>“We have taken a lot of feedback to heart,” explained the studio. “Over the summer, we have worked hard on releasing updates to the game. Still, Breakpoint is only the first major step, we know we need a few more<b>,&nbsp;</b>bringing significant improvements and new systems, as well as content, into the game, incorporating community feedback alongside our own ideas.” The team also thanked players for “sticking” around as it essentially redevelops <em>FBC</em> post-launch. I hope it all works out, and I’m excited to hop back in to the new <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> as we enter spooky season.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Payday 2</em> is getting a subscription service for all its DLC</strong></h2> <p>Did you know that 2013’s<em> Payday 2,</em> a co-op heist shooter, has over 60 pieces of DLC? That’s wild, huh? The game has so much DLC that developer Starbreeze is now offering people a monthly subscription service that grants them access to all of it. The new sub comes in two flavors: $4.99 a month or $19.99 for six months. It’s not a horrible deal, and for new players or folks just wanting to play with friends who might own everything, it’s a fine option.</p>

 <p>But many players aren’t happy that, alongside this subscription launch, the studio has increased the price for a bundle that includes all the DLC. Previously, buying all the DLC cost around $135. Now it’s marked up to $170. Yikes! <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/payday-2/subscription-service">Starbreeze tells <em>PCGamesn</em></a> that the price increase is “completely unrelated” to the subscription service. Sure! Regardless, it’s left a bad taste in many mouths and is likely to make folks assume the new sub is just a way to squeeze more money out of folks not willing to pay $170+ for all the DLC.</p>

 <h2><strong>Nintendo just released a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, but…</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html">So a new<em> Fire Emblem</em> game was shadow-dropped overnight on September 24.</a> That should be exciting. However, people who have downloaded and played <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> have discovered it’s a not-so-great <em>Among Us</em>-like free-to-play social deduction game. That’s not what a lot of<em> Fire Emblem</em> fans wanted, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marioprime.bsky.social/post/3lzmpnsogls2i">early impressions are bad</a>, with some people reporting that the game feels extremely underbaked and barebones. But don’t worry, there’s a battle pass and plenty of ways to spend money.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS Delta’</em>s multiplayer mode is launching next month</strong></h2> <p>On September 25, as part of Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-online-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt-has-a-release-date-fresh-update-out-now">Konami announced</a> that the multiplayer mode for its recently released <em>MGS3</em> remake will launch on October 30. It will be part of a bigger free update arriving for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> next month.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The cat-and-mouse online PVP stealth mode will support up to 12 players across all platforms and is arriving about two months after<em> MGS Delta: Snake Eater</em> launched to mostly positive reviews. It doesn’t seem anything like my beloved <em>Metal Gear Solid Online,</em> but it could be fun, I guess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s beta will include Zombies content</strong></h2>  <p>For the first time in the franchise’s long history, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-deep-dive">the next <em>Call of Duty</em> game’s beta will include some Zombies content</a>.
