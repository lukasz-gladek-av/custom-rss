		<p>We’re just a month away from the release of Still Wakes The Deep on 18th June, and developer The Chinese Room has now revealed the full voice cast for its oil rig horror with a new story mini documentary.</p>
<p><iframe title="STILL WAKES THE DEEP | Voice Cast Reveal | Story Minidoc" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuvVm2w49GA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With top billing as main character Cameron “Caz” McLeary goes to Alec Newman, the Glaswegian actor who will be familiar to fans of Cyberpunk 2077 as Adam Smasher. Also joining the cast is Neve McIntosh as Suze, Caz’s wife, while the rest of the cast list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alec Newman as Caz</li>
<li>Neve McIntosh as Suze</li>
<li>Karen Dunbar</li>
<li>Michael Abubakar</li>
<li>Clive Russell</li>
<li>Shaun Dooley</li>
<li>Stewart Scudamore</li>
<li>Nicholas Boulton</li>
<li>Duncan Pow</li>
<li>Sandy Batchelor</li>
<li>Alan Turkington</li>
<li>Noof Ousellam</li>
</ul>
<p>As a first person horror, a lot of emphasis will be put on Alec’s voice acting chops to carry you through the story, but the cast as a whole will get to really lean into the thick and coarse regional accents from the north of the UK, given the setting.</p>
<p>Set in 1975 on the Beria D oil rig off the coast of Scotland, players will have to survive as the rig is torn apart by an otherworldly horror that has been unwittingly released in the unending quest for oil. The Chinese Room is getting to return to their roots as a studio both in terms of gameplay – it’s a narrative horror, so expect “walking simulator” to be bandied about a bit – and with filling this setting and narrative concept out with touches and details to really ground the player.</p>

<p>Newman says in the mini documentary that “The thing was so well written, and so well-conceived, that I don’t recall having very long conversations about what Caz should sound like. With this, you can feel the writing, you can feel the characters.”</p>
<p>Still Wakes The Deep is out on 18th June for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and PC – it will also be available day one with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

                <p>Hellblade developer Ninja Theory is reportedly working on a new game, and isn't at risk of shutting down--like several of its sibling studios have at Microsoft.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the studio's new game has already been greenlit and Microsoft isn't considering closing the studio. Additionally, the new game is reportedly separate from Project Mara, which Ninja Theory revealed back in 2021. There aren't any more details about this new game, such as whether it's another entry in the Hellblade series or an entirely different IP.</p><p>Project Mara is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hellblade-dev-shows-off-photorealistic-graphics-for-project-mara/1100-6486453/" data-ref-id="1100-6486453">billed as a psychological horror game</a> that focuses on photorealism and takes place in one apartment.

There were worries that other Xbox studios such as Ninja Theory could potentially suffer the same fate after the release of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, since Arkane Austin was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-austin-was-pitching-immersive-sim-prior-to-closure-more-cuts-at-xbox-coming-report/1100-6523286/" data-ref-id="1100-6523286">reportedly pitching a new game</a> before it was shut down.</p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is now available for PC and Xbox Series X|S.

<p data-characters="406" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you’ll receive new Resonators by participating in gacha events and pulling for weapons and characters. However, it’s&nbsp;not uncommon&nbsp;to run into a dry streak that has you wondering when you’ll get the Resonator or&nbsp;weapon&nbsp;you want. Fortunately, this is where the pity system guarantees you’ll get the five-star character you’re looking for.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-pity-system" data-injectable="false">What is the Pity System?</h2> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">Pity in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is a system that allows you to get a guaranteed five-star character or weapon after 80 convenes. While you can get a five-star before this point, reaching 80 guarantees ensures you&nbsp;won’t go&nbsp;without a reward for hundreds of pulls. While you’re not initially guaranteed to get an event’s featured character from the pity system, the odds increase to 50 percent once you get a pity roll. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio (YouTube)</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">There’s also another layer to the pity system. If you activate the pity system and don’t get the featured Resonator on your first go, the next activation guarantees your next five-star will be the featured one. In other words, if you’re determined to get a particular Resonator from an event, such as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-pull-for-jiyan-or-yinlin-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan or Yinlin</a>, you’ll eventually get it if you reach pity twice. </p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">The exception to this is the Novice Convene, which grants you a guaranteed five-star Resonator for every 50 Convenes. That way, if you’re a beginner player who wants a head start on obtaining powerful five-star characters or weapons, it’ll be much easier to reach pity if you don’t have the best luck with your gacha pulls.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio (YouTube)</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-guaranteed-5-star-character-or-weapon" data-injectable="false">How to get a guaranteed 5-star character or weapon</h2> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Alongside the pity system,&nbsp;<em>Wuthering Waves</em>&nbsp;has targeted Convene events, allowing you to choose the character you get after 80 Convenes. That way, if you want a particular Resonator, you can guarantee you’ll get that specific character once you activate pity.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">The first time you’ll encounter this is during the Beginner’s Choice Convene, which offers the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-5-star-selector-character-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five following Selector Resonators</a>:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Jianxin</li> <li>Calcharo</li> <li>Verina</li> <li>Lingyang</li> <li>Encore</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio (YouTube)</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">By picking one of these five characters during the Beginner’s Choice Convene, your next pity roll will include your chosen Resonator. You can also do this with&nbsp;Weapon&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;Convenes if you need a particular weapon for one of your characters.</p> <h2 id="h-all-wuthering-waves-event-types-and-wishes" data-injectable="false">All Wuthering Waves event types and wishes</h2> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"><em>Wuthering Wave’s</em> pity system applies to all Character and Weapon Convene events, allowing you to reach pity in either. Below is each event type and their required currencies:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Convene Tide</th><th data-align="center">Banner Event</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Lustrous Tide</td><td data-align="center">Novice Convene and Standard Convene</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Radiant Tide</td><td data-align="center">Character Event Convene</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Forging Tide</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Event Convene</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="166" data-injectable="false">You’ll receive Lustrous, Radiant, and Forging Tide from log-in rewards, ongoing events, and by purchasing using Astrite, a premium currency in <em>Wuthering Waves.</em> </p>

<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-voice-cast-and-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>&nbsp;has yet&nbsp;to make a console debut, players wonder whether or not controller support will be available. Thankfully, a developer update has given us some insight into this feature, and we’re here to explain what to expect.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-play-wuthering-waves-with-a-controller" data-injectable="false">Can you play Wuthering Waves with a controller?</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">During a special broadcast, the game’s development team states, “We are largely done with the gamepad controller support,” indicating that <strong><em>Wuthering Waves&nbsp;</em>will have controller support</strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>However, it’s important to note that the availability of this feature at launch is still&nbsp;uncertain, depending on the game’s progress.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Wuthering Waves | Special Broadcast Program | 2024/03/29" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRIl3JqxfVk?start=1509&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><em>Wuthering Waves’&nbsp;</em>controller support has undergone significant development. Initially absent during the beta tests, it was a feature that players were keen to see. In response to their feedback, Kuro Game Studio finally worked on a new update to implement this mechanic, including customizable key settings. The studio also aims to improve experiences across all platforms for a much more responsive and smoother gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Considering that&nbsp;the special broadcast was revealed&nbsp;some time ago, controller support could be ready for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-the-exact-release-time-of-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official release</a>. It will likely include PlayStation 4 and 5 controller support, given that these devices will be available at a later date. Xbox may not&nbsp;be included, as <em>Wuthering Waves</em> has only been involved with PC, PlayStation, and mobile.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="false">We’ll update this guide to confirm controller support availability upon launch. However, it may not arrive until afterward, possibly with a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-all-confirmed-launch-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new update</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24160618/cool-sword-day-phantom-blade-world-of-warcraft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wRh9fc">The coolest sword I ever obtained in a video game is the Phantom Blade in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>. In fact, it’s so cool to me that I never parted with it. It’s still sitting in my original character’s bank vault, some 19 years after I first got it — even though its stats have been squished almost to nothing by the multiple math resets the venerable online game has had over the years, and even though that character has now far outleveled the point at which the sword would be useful.</p>

<p id="oISITC">What makes the Phantom Blade cool? It’s not a special weapon, although it’s not bad. It’s not some Legendary boss drop earned through the blood, sweat, and tantrums of a raid party. It’s not even Epic — just a run-of-the-mill blue Rare. It doesn’t hold a special place within Warcraft lore, it’s no Ashbringer or Frostmourne. It’s just… a sword. But to me, it’s not just any sword.</p>
<p id="c3xC8b">Back in 2005 — or now, if you’re playing on Blizzard’s Classic servers that (more or less) replicate the game as it was then — the Phantom Blade was a decent, crafted weapon for mid- to high-level characters, though definitely not endgame gear. It could be used from level 44 (the cap was then 60), at which point it was pretty nifty, and would stay competitive until probably the early 50s.</p>

<p id="DedtEi">The damage stats are OK, and it has a useful “proc” (a chance to trigger an effect on hit): it decreases the target’s armor for 20 seconds, and prevents them from entering stealth or turning invisible during that time. This made it a coveted weapon in <em>WoW</em>’s player-versus-player community for dealing with annoying Rogue players (and was thus hated by Rogues). The thing is, I never played PvP.</p>
<p id="KURPAU">My original <em>WoW</em> character was a Warrior. I didn’t want to play a Warrior, really; I fancied either a Hunter or a Druid, but when I joined the game, my friends’ guild already had plenty of those and was short of tanks, so it was deemed that a Warrior I should be. I did not take to it — I’m terrible at tanking, and when it comes to playing a damage-dealing role, <em>WoW </em>has other classes I prefer. I moved on to a Hunter main eventually, but that Warrior still has a special place in my heart. In my headcanon he has an endearing, good-natured ineptitude about him, and the adventures we went on, discovering Blizzard’s extraordinary creation together, are unforgettable. Anyway, while not a specifically great weapon for Warriors, the Phantom Blade’s armor debuff was quite handy when tanking.</p>
<p id="qfeUKD">But that wasn’t why I coveted it either. No, I wanted a Phantom Blade for two, very shallow, reasons. One: true to its name, it is a ghostly sword with a curving, translucent blade that gives off a soft, bluish glow. It looks <em>sick</em>. Two: unlike almost every other one-handed weapon in the game, the Phantom Blade shows across the character’s back when at rest, rather than at the side as if hanging off the belt. For a tanking warrior, that means it’s carried diagonally underneath a shield. This looks unique — and <em>sick as hell</em>.</p>
<p id="smmrgY">Man, I wanted a Phantom Blade so much. Have you ever gotten like this, when you covet a virtual item with an intense, almost painful hunger, just as much as you could want something in real life? That’s how much I wanted a Phantom Blade.</p>

<p id="Sr62pZ">The only way to get a Phantom Blade is for a character with the blacksmithing profession to craft one. I couldn’t afford the prices it was going for at the auction house, and my Warrior character was an engineer, so I needed our guild blacksmith to make it for me. These things weren’t that easy or cheap to make — you needed mithril <em>and </em>truesilver bars, several aquamarine gems, some rarish Breath of Wind drops, plus two lesser invisibility potions, meaning an alchemist needed to get involved too.</p>
<p id="0e3iv0">As I remember it, I mined the raw metals myself, but my guildmates pulled together the rest of it as a gift to me. Maybe they knew I didn’t really enjoy the tanking they’d made me do, and were making up for that. Maybe they were just being nice. We would do stuff like that for each other, in those days before every <em>WoW </em>expansion became a ruthlessly optimized race to the finish line. One reason my Warrior-engineer leveled slowly and wasn’t a very good Warrior is that I set myself the goal of crafting an entirely pointless mechanical squirrel pet for every single member of the guild. This took <em>ages</em>, and it was a real chore, but also maybe the most fun I ever had playing<em> WoW</em>.</p>
<p id="UIGgjK">So that’s why I still hang on to my Phantom Blade. My friends made it for me, and it reminds me of them — and of a time when this incredible game was an all-consuming engine of wonder for us to discover together.</p>
<p id="tyLBHJ">Also, it looks really fucking cool.</p>

In his typical joking manner, Reynolds said Deadpool and Wolverine is nothing more than a paper-thin sequel that will lower your IQ. It should be fun and raise your heart rate, though, so that's something.</p><p>"We're very excited to be joining you July 26, but we should set the table correctly. This film is as paper thin as a sequel to Battlefield Earth. We're mostly going to beat each other senseless, make enemies with Disney, tell a few dick jokes, make a few jokes at my expense, make a lot of jokes at Hugh's expense, and completely sidestep Marvel's mandated after-credits sequence, which if you haven't figured it out yet, is always just a commercial for another movie which will invariably end with a commercial for another movie," Reynolds said.</p><p>He added: "So sit back, relax, let us lower your IQ and raise your heart rate while we travel to a vapid Dreamland, a place where grown men and grown women walk around in tights, and act like it's not a giant cultural cry for help. This is cinema."</p><p>While a lot of this statement is pretty funny and silly, the line about Deadpool and Wolverine not having an after-credits sequence is noteworthy (if Reynolds was being serious here). Most Marvel movies have a post-credits sequence that tees up the next Marvel movie, but it seems Deadpool and Wolverine won't do this, for whatever reason. Or maybe Reynolds was joking about this too.</p><p>Deadpool and Wolverine releases on July 26, and it is Marvel's one and only film in 2024. Some of Marvel's upcoming films for 2025 include Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, and The Fantastic Four.</p><p>In other Deadpool and Wolverine news, ticket-seller Fandango recently announced that the movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-and-wolverine-has-strongest-day-one-ticket-pre-sales-in-franchise-history-at-fandango/1100-6523599/" data-ref-id="1100-6523599">broke first-day sales records</a>.

While a delightful experience purely from spending time with the frogs alone, there is an underlying theme of wetland importance and care that makes this game so much more than a cute animal collection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer caught up with Mélanie Christin and Aurélien Condomines of Humble Reeds to talk about how they came up with the idea of collecting frogs to increase awareness of wetland importance and preservation, the challenges that come from making many different cute frogs players would want to collect, and how they wove wetland preservation into the game’s mechanics without bogging the game down in the complexities of environmental care.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer: What inspired the creation of a game about collecting frogs and restoring wetlands? How did the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> come together?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mélanie Christin and Aurélien Condomines</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We both had a desire to make games with a positive societal impact that were still fun to play. While researching tangible solutions about climate change on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://drawdown.org/">the Project Drawdown website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we read about how wetlands are natural carbon sinks and just how much carbon would be captured or not emitted if we committed to preserving and restoring wetlands. This seemed to be a very concrete solution, and wetlands are rich places.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-the-green-new-deal-simulator-inspires-hope-in-a-climate-changing-world" target="_self">How <em>Green New Deal Simulator</em> inspires hope in a climate changing world</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To encourage players to care about wetlands and their biodiversity, we made frogs the main object of care because they’re popular and the most likely to be tended to as pets. So that’s how two main pillars of the game came to be: restoring the wetlands so that your pet frogs are happy!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also an important decoration aspect in the game, as well as some narrative parts, because we think the audience for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is interested in these features in a game. The storyline binds all these elements together by enabling the game progression and traveling to new biomes.</span></p><p>Image via Armor Games Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into weaving wetland care together with frog collecting? How did you maintain a balance so that the joys of collecting cute frogs were always at the forefront, but a strong message about restoring biodiversity was still threaded throughout the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we said, frogs are the vehicle that make players care even more about wetlands, so it was necessary that the two aspects were closely intertwined. In the game, you cannot progress without restoring the wetlands: they have a carbon capture gauge and a biodiversity score, and you need those two for the frog collecting aspect both because rare frogs will only show in restored wetlands but also for collecting insects that you feed your frogs with.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-very-best-way-the-games-industry-can-reduce-its-carbon-footprint" target="_self">The very best way the games industry can reduce its carbon footprint</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The same is true the other way around: you need the reputation points that your frog refuge generates to unlock more effective wetland restoration tools. This way, the two aspects are carefully balanced and complementary. We do not try to impose an eco-friendly message on players; we follow the rule “show, don’t tell.” The wetlands are restored and beautiful, and the cute frogs are happy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into creating so many different types of cute frogs for players to collect? How did you develop such a variety of fun frogs for players to find?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of people ask us if the frogs’ species are based on real-life frogs, but unlike most of the rest in the game, the answer is no. With the collecting aspect, and with a video game with a lot of tiny elements, you need the patterns to be very distinctive from each other so that you immediately know if it’s already part of your collection or not. And because we want the game to be fun and appealing, we needed big, recognizable, cute frogs that pop on the screen and catch the players’ attention. We thus had to invent fantasy patterns for the frogs that would be easily recognizable and combine them with a certain number of colors to have a wide range of possible frogs while maintaining a certain level of readability. Right now, the full game contains eight patterns of frogs, with eight possible colors for primary and secondary colors, which puts the frog count at 512.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>LIkewise, how did you decide on the various biomes and places across the world where players would collect their frogs?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted the different biomes to be quite distinctive from each other, from the color palette to the different types of native vegetation you would find. We also thought it would be fun for players all around the world to discover other types of biomes than the ones they know and meet all sorts of local characters. Luckily there are tons of different wetlands around the globe!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first biome is kind of a Western peatland that you would find, for example, in the northern parts of Germany. The second biome is a Billabong, a certain type of Australian wetland based on dead river arms that flood in winter and get dry in the summer. The third one is an Indonesian mangrove located near the coastline, with trees and vegetation adapted to a mix of saline and sweet water.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each is restored differently, but they all contribute to carbon capture in their own way and need to be preserved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us a bit about the research that went into the game? How did you learn about wetlands and other environmental elements and how those shaped the development of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game remains a game; it is not an educational game on frogs or wetlands, so we did some research, but not at a scientific level. The frogs being fantasy frogs helped a lot in this aspect!</span></p><p>Images via Armor Games Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into picking the ways that players would interact with those biomes in order to draw frogs to them? How did you design a variety of different environmental activities players would take part in to teach them about biodiversity while making them light enough that the game would not get bogged down in complex ideas?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We kept the environmental activities really light and drew inspiration from common city-building games where you just place elements along a grid and watch them interact. The biodiversity part was trickier: we wanted players to restore a wetland, but not by just planting a ton of the same crop. We had to account for the balance between the crops and convey that to the players in the most simple way. So, we came up with what we call a “Bioscore,” which is how biodiversity influences your carbon capture to come up with a unified score. If one of the crops is lagging behind, we nudge the player to plant more of it through a simple set of icons in the wetland dashboard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there are more optional environmental activities, like picking up nettle to make powder, installing beehives and insect hotels, etc. But they’re not as crucial as the biodiversity aspect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Your environmentally conscious message is carefully run through not just the game, but how you developed it to be lightweight and work on older computers as well. Can you tell us what appealed to you about creating a game that would work on a wider variety of computer specs? What challenges did you face as creators in getting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> to be able to work on more machines?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We are developing the game with Godot Engine, which is naturally built for lightweightness and performance on low-tier machines. It also allows us to target a lot of platforms all at once, thanks to the thousands of open-source contributors working together to achieve that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because the game is in the cozy genre, one of our biggest goals was to port the game to the Nintendo Switch, which has specs that do not compare well with high-end PCs, so we were mindful in each of our design decisions that it didn’t impact performance too much.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We are also quite a small team, with a small budget, strong 2D expertise, and developing the game on our own old-ish computers, so all of that makes us savvy in every way!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What effect do you hope your game has on the player? What thoughts do you hope your game inspires?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As is probably the case for every game developer out there, we would be glad if we could bring joy to as many players as possible. More specifically, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is designed to make players feel good and relaxed after a long day, bringing them some peace to their busy minds. We hope that through the story, they feel reinvigorated about working together with others for the greater good, and that they see how beautiful wetlands can be. And maybe—and that would be the cherry on the cake—build a small pond in their yard or contribute to local wetlands or biodiversity initiatives!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players must capture scenes as they unfold (for better or worse) in the guise of a producer-meets-director, honing in on certain shots to placate specific demographics (like 'Butt Guys' or 'Foodies') and casting characters to spark dramatics or genuine affection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The interactions responsible for nurturing or torching relationships, however, are the product of Rigmarole. He explains Rigmarole represented the "biggest technical challenge" because it had to be a narrative system capable of accounting for a myriad of factors such as character traits, background details, audience preferences, and more. She says Rigmarole really only began to take shape over the past year, and notes that in the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> prototype all conversations were hard coded to provide some early flavor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the project finally moved forward, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> writing team began cobbling together dialogue in a tool called Scripto, which she says is a "very nice web interface for writing scripts." Nerial then devised a tool that could easily pull those scripts into Unity and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As He explains, it was a "priority for us that our writers were able to write freely."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those scripts added more depth to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> roster of housemates, which features 12 "wild, sexy singles" each with their own unique personality traits. Although only four can compete in each season, players will be able to mix-and-match characters with repeat playthroughs to see who might fall in love—or perhaps become sworn enemies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We reduced them to personality traits," says He. "Those are the things that are important about them. So we spreadsheeted it all our to ensure there's a good mix of people being attracted to each other, or not attracted to each other. Then, one thing Francois did was come up with a system for us to design all the individual scripts that would happen based on the relationships and different types of attractions [in play.]"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="In reality television, every contestant has a role to play">In reality television, every contestant has a role to play</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That system is Rigmarole. It has to manage around 50,000 lines of dialogue and in the words of Alliot is "quite complex."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's a system that takes the characters and their traits and defines whether they're attracted to each other and their basic dynamics," explains Alliot. "Then we have what we call the 'saga,' which are groups of events spread across a schedule. Within that saga we have protagonists with defined roles—so [one cast member] Damien might be 'the seducer,' for example."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those factors will impact other characters depending on their respective traits and roles, letting Nerial create melodrama that's very "granular" based on specific, but fluctuating, attributes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier in our chat, He explains there's potentially 400 ways to combine those 12 cast members, and that means balancing has been a gradual—but critical—process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have a very definitive point at which the game goes from 'doesn't work' to 'it works.' There's no building up scene after scene after scene," explains Alliot. "It's more about building up all the possible matches to make things fully defined and add some flow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That slow refinement informed Nerial's decision to keep the project—which has been in development for around five years—under wraps for so long.

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re not far out from the release of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, the first DLC expansion for 2022’s excellent <em>Elden Ring</em>. Today, we got a story trailer detailing just what’s in store, including some pretty significant story for one of the leading players: Miquella.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">Called “Miquella the Kind” in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uT8wGtB3yQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a>, the offspring of Radagon and Marika, twin to Malenia, the demigod is a focal point of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. In today’s trailer, we hear about a seduction, and betrayal; an “affair from which Gold arose, and so too was Shadow born.”</p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">The ensuing, unseen war highlights the “tyranny of Messmer’s flame,” which seems to coat the royal city of Leyndell. We’re also reminded of Miquella’s sacrifice, giving up his flesh, strength, and “even his fate” for a cause. But as the trailer asserts, “we” are not deterred, implying Miquella’s followers still persist in the Lands Between.</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">There’s a lot to unpack here. I have no doubt the lore folks will pore over this trailer in the coming days, as it hints towards information on one of <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s still-lingering threads in Miquella <em>and </em>hints towards history we might not have been directed to, before now. This war that could not be sung sure seems chaotic.</p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, we won’t be waiting long. <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is only about a month away, arriving on June 21, 2024. Though it’ll cost <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$39.99</a>, the expansion is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dlcs-map-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-limgrave/1100-6521275/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also set to be fairly big</a>, so it seems like FromSoft fans will have a lot to chew on near the end of June.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From Software and Bandai Namco have released a new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>story trailer that sets up the narrative for the upcoming DLC expansion.</p>

<p>As the trailer begins, a voiceover speaks about "the seduction and the betrayal" that gave rise to both Gold and Shadow. It's all preceded by a mention of "Miquella the Kind", the central figure around which&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>will seemingly revolve.</p>

<p>Following this introduction, we hear about a "war unseen" as giant flame constructs march across a city. The voiceover describes the war as "a purge without grace or honor", led by "the tyranny of Messmer's flame".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-messmer.jpg?itok=GXpXyTi3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-messmer.jpg?itok=UGMCgfNP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Messmer will play an important role in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We then hear that Kindly Miquella has "abandon[ed] everything" as we see a series of marks that look a lot like one of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Great Runes. Since these are usually held by gods and demigods, we can perhaps infer that this is Miquella's Great Rune.</p>

<p>Miquella has seemingly stripped himself of his "Golden flesh" and "even his fate" in order to venture into the Land of Shadow, although we're still not sure exactly what he's doing there.</p>

<p>The voiceover says that "we", presumably referring to the group of Tarnished we see in the trailer, "are not deterred". It seems, then, that you'll be following in Miquella's footsteps as he roams the Land of Shadow, and you'll presumably find out what happened to the realm along the way.</p>

<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>story trailer right here.</p>




<p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-erdtree-announced">back in February last year</a>, the expansion will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">launching next month</a>&nbsp;and will give you the chance to fight new enemies and bosses, obtain new gear, and discover a new part of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s world.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-deluxe-edition/9PGMB8DCQ56N">Xbox</a> on June 21st.

All we knew then was the DLC would take place in the Land of Shadow and feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158964/fromsoftware-just-debuted-their-bloodiest-monster-yet">a bunch of new horrors</a> straight from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18272238/hsekiro-shadows-die-twice-idetaka-miyazaki-interview-dark-souls">slightly warped imagination of game director Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>.</p></div><p>This new Land of Shadow was connected somehow to Miquella — the dude in the egg with the withered arm. The trailer mentions him prominently, giving the impression we’ll learn more about him, his connection to the Land of Shadow, and what events led him to abandon the place to its fiery fate. </p><p>Speaking of fiery fate, the trailer also spends its short runtime on Messmer, the red-haired hottie with the snakes who seems like he’ll be the DLC’s final boss. (Although you never can tell with FromSoftware games. Once you think you’ve beaten the final boss, some cosmic entity arrives and blows up your last flask of healing.) Messmer is apparently responsible for the great purge of the Land of Shadow, and I’m curious to know why. </p><p>The story trailer was short and light and cryptic, as FromSoftware stories tend to be. I’m looking forward to the <em>hours</em> of YouTube deep dives I’ll digest as creators (shout out to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fc%2FIronPineapple">Iron Pineapple</a>) extrapolate the deepest of lore from the smallest of moments. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> launches on June 21st on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> is out now, and on PC, it’s a demanding but visually dazzling experience if you’ve got the hardware (check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessio’s review of the game running on an RTX 4090 here</a>), but what about consoles? Before launch, it was revealed that Hellblade II would only have a single 30fps visual mode on Xbox Series X/S, but at least that narrow focus would mean the game would consistently nail that 30fps, right? Well, about that… the folks at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> have taken the Xbox versions of Hellblade II for a spin, and the results aren’t quite as solid as you might hope. Check out the full analysis below if you have around 15 minutes to spare, or scroll on down for our rundown of the salient points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hellblade 2 | Xbox Series S/X - PC  | Graphics Comparison | Analista De Bits" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNwO6WZD0cg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the above analysis, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II runs at a dynamic 2560x1070p with an average res of around 2304x963p on Xbox Series X and a dynamic 1920x803p with an average of 1472x615p on Xbox Series S (the resolutions are rather wonky due to the game running in “cinematic” 2.39:1 widescreen mode with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen). In terms of visual quality, the Series X looks very similar to the PC on higher settings, while the Series S is a bit lower quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither the Xbox Series X or S seems to be able to maintain a consistent 30fps. While both hit 30fps perhaps 80 percent of the time, dips look to be common during more visually lush and action-packed scenes. The Xbox Series X can drop into the mid-20fps range, and the Xbox Series S can plunge all the way down to the low 20s. Oddly, the two systems seem to struggle at slightly different points, perhaps tied to how each system handles its dynamic resolution.</p>
<p>At least for now, it seems like Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II may be the game that’s just a bit too pretty for the Xbox Series X/S. Here’s hoping a bit more optimization can be brought to the table in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is available now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

  <p id="8WR4Aw">FromSoftware released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> expansion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079297/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-release-date-editions-messmer-impaler"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> on Tuesday, giving fans of the open-world fantasy adventure a fresh look at the DLC’s story. That includes new details on its imposing new villain, Messmer the Impaler, a powerful demigod who appears to have a strong connection to characters from the original <em>Elden Ring</em> story.</p>
<p id="tDgdhG"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s new trailer also hints at what sent the demigod <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131400/elden-ring-dlc-miquella-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Miquella</a> to a new land, one that was crushed under the tyranny of Messmer’s flame, and for which Miquella sacrificed himself. The trailer ends with the followers of Miquella joining forces and beckoning new warriors to join them on their journey to depose Messmer and his burning legions.</p>
<p id="tHLtXA">Our latest look at <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is something we’ve come to expect from FromSoft: a CG trailer that dives deeper into the opaque lore of <em>Elden Ring</em> and doesn’t offer anything in the way of new gameplay. But for students of <em>Elden Ring</em> myth, it’s a rich vein of information about characters and their allegiances in this complicated family story.</p>
<p id="TMAuFL"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23991138/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-release-date-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> will send players to an unexplored region known as the Land of Shadow, just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-start-dlc-access-point-location-miquellas-cocoon">a short egg ride from Mohgwyn Palace</a>. There, in a landmass roughly the size of the game’s Limgrave region, they’ll explore the dark realm and follow in the footsteps of the mysterious Empyrean Miquella.</p>
<p id="8UmUEq"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will be released on June 21. The expansion is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via Steam, just like the original <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p>A new trailer has been published online ahead of Summer Games Fest, showcasing around one minute of stunning vistas and sumptuous visuals from Delta Force: Hawk Ops. This is a game that’s fast entering mythical status, as despite a few teaser sequences surfacing online and the developer – TiMi Studio – hyping the game up, we’re yet to see tangible evidence that it’s a real thing that we’ll be able to play any time soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-hawk-down">Black Hawk Down</h2>



<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops looks like a fever dream for a Battlefield fan. It boasts large-scale combat fused with vehicular warfare, destructible environments, and real-world, gritty gunplay reminiscent of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield, which were often considered the peak of the franchise. In one recent Delta Force trailer, we looked at some concerning content, such as a ‘specialist-based’ operating system and some bizarre, out-of-place in-game abilities bordering on the ‘basically out of place’ kind of level.</p>



<p>In the most recent Delta Force: Hawk Ops trailer, we’re given a one-minute-long look at some in-game locales, as well as a slew of weapons. The short video shows some tasty lighting elements and some dynamic weather effects, but aside from the character doing the ‘super slow trailer walk’ through what might be a series of multiplayer maps, there isn’t much to take away:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Delta Force: Hawk Ops | Official Summer Game Fest 2024 Teaser" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kl-Hgelwc9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks good, but it’s hard to see it being anything more than a Battlefield clone at the moment. Even some of the naming conventions for the multiplayer modes (‘Hazard Operations’) are a bit close to the line. On June 7, we’ll get a deeper look at Delta Force: Hawk Ops as the game gets <strong>yet another trailer </strong>at Summer Game Fest.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Official Switch Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The original Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/1900-6110235/" data-ref-id="1900-6110235">glowing praise even back in 2004</a>. This enhanced HD remaster on Switch can be bought digitally and physically for $60.</p><p>You can see a few review scores for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2024). For more reviews, be sure to visit GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Game:</strong> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2024)</li><li><strong>Platform:</strong> Nintendo Switch</li><li><strong>Developer:</strong> Intelligent Systems/Nintendo</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 23, 2024</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $60</li></ul><h2>GameSpot -- 9/10</h2><p>"The Switch version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive way to play the best turn-based RPG starring Mario. More of an enhanced HD remaster than a full-fledged remake, The Thousand-Year Door has small yet meaningful quality-of-life features that ease some of the bloat from the original GameCube version. The catchy remixed soundtrack wonderfully complements the thoroughly entertaining and dynamic turn-based battle system. Throw in a stellar cast of characters and consistently playful writing, and The Thousand-Year Door has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG. Well, it always had them, but now they are blended a bit better." -- <em>Steven Petite </em>[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/" data-ref-id="1900-6418230">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Digital Trends -- 9/10</h2><p>"If you were hoping that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Nintendo was a thorough remake that redefines a classic, you may come away from this Switch remake disappointed. Thankfully, The Thousand-Year Door still holds up 20 years after release, thanks to some hilarious dialogue, timeless visuals, and an approachable RPG battle system." -- <em>Tomas Franzese</em> [<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Shack News -- 9/10</h2><p>"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door might be ever so slightly dated in its first two chapters and its insistence on loading every area with too many enemies. Its bizarre cast, excellent writing, and inventive battles mean it earns its reputation as one of the best and most inventive RPGs, though, and it’s just as fresh and imaginative now as it ever was." -- <em>Josh Broadwell</em> [<a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/139935/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-review-score" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>TheGamer -- 8/10</h2><p>"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door will probably be the last Mario game to release (solely) on the Switch. While Wonder will take the plaudits, porting this cult classic means that a new generation of players can experience it. New fans will have a ball, laughing along with Mario &amp; co., even if their experience will be slightly marred by the backtracking and pacing. Old fans will enjoy the quality of life improvements and some new additions. Whether you’re a Paper Mario veteran or this is your first time entering his origami world, this is the definitive way to experience The Thousand-Year Door." -- <em>Ben Sledge</em> [<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Wccftech -- 8/10</h2><p>"While I may have come off somewhat critical of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in this review, there’s still an undeniable richness and depth to its world that no other game in the series has quite managed to achieve. Rogueport, with its varied cast of ne’er-do-wells and weirdos and countless secrets, is still one of my favorite locales I’ve ever visited with Nintendo’s plumber. Even with its minor streamlining, the new TTYD still serves up a solid 25-hour story with plenty of side content to clean up, including perhaps some small new post-game treats. This papery adventure definitely isn’t a lightweight." -- <em>Nathan Birch</em> [<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Jeuxvideo.com -- 7.5/10</h2><p>"This remastered version maintains the excellence of its pen with a cast of characters each as striking as the next with a combat system that has already proven itself. The modernized artistic direction works wonders, both visually and aurally. But form is not everything. The structure of the game can quickly weigh on anyone who is allergic to the multiple forced back and forth, especially since the features to relieve this archaic architecture are too little impactful to relieve its heaviness." -- <em>Charlanmhg</em> [<a href="https://www.jeuxvideo.com/test/1886203/c-est-l-un-des-meilleurs-jeux-video-mario-de-son-genre-et-il-arrive-sur-nintendo-switch-20-ans-apres-paper-mario-la-porte-millenaire-est-il-toujours-indemodable.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.</p>

<p>Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion.

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">At the risk of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ive-been-playing-destiny-2-wrong-for-nearly-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing <em>Destiny 2</em> incorrectly</a>, the odds are good that you, too, use a third-party <em>Destiny</em> inventory manager of some sort to move items around via your browser, phone, or some other digital implement. Now, though, there’s a new tool at your disposal, known as Deepsight.gg.</p> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">The creator of Deepsight.gg, known under their Reddit username ChiriVulpes, posted about the inventory manager’s release <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cw25ay/ive_been_working_on_an_item_manager_since_season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the <em>Destiny 2</em> subreddit</a>, where they explained what makes this tool such a big deal. For one, it looks positively <em>snazzy</em>, as it follows the visual cues of the game itself, which features striking, easy-to-read UI across the board. Anyone interested in checking out Deepsight.gg can now do so and <a href="https://deepsight.gg/weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin managing their <em>Destiny 2</em> inventory right away</a>, but the really interesting bit is that this toolkit can do <em>way</em> more than just that.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-deepsight-gg-is-now-out-with-plenty-of-updates-in-the-pipeline" data-injectable="false">Deepsight.gg is now out, with plenty of updates in the pipeline</h2> <p data-characters="111" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">As ChiriVulpes explains, Deepsight.gg’s general feature list at the time of its release is the following:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Destiny 2</em>-inspired UI across the board</li> <li>basic item management functionality</li> <li>extremely granular sorting systems</li> <li>filtering via input, with highlighting and buttons suggesting additional options</li> <li>full access to the game’s Collections UI</li> <li>access to item drop sources</li> <li>item and Perk wishlisting</li> <li>full player overview for all three <em>Destiny 2</em> characters</li> <li>comprehensive tooltips providing more access to information than other item managers do</li> <li>“spying” on other Guardians’ inventories and gear</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">And loads more, of course. All in all, then, Deepsight.gg does appear to be a powerful substitute to the widely acclaimed and almost universally used <a href="https://destinyitemmanager.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny Item Manager</a> (DIM, for short), but for a single issue: Deepsight.gg does not support custom loadouts just yet. ChiriVulpes appears not to have been aware of how many people used DIM’s loadout functionality – which can overwrite the in-game loadouts on the fly – and they’ve now pivoted to include loadouts as soon as possible.</p>
 <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="96" data-injectable="false">As per <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cw25ay/ive_been_working_on_an_item_manager_since_season/l4tz1dz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChiriVulpes’ later comment on Reddit</a>, the priority list for Deepsight.gg is simple:</p> <figure data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">Good stuff all around, then. Deepsight.gg is already remarkably powerful and will deliver on all the usual item management fronts (and then some), but it goes without saying that many people simply won’t move on from DIM no matter what, given how emblematic the tool has become over the years. Still, competition is good, and Deepsight.gg is an excellent competitor that’s only going to get better as ChiriVulpes continues working on it.</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">It’s going to be particularly interesting to see how DIM, Deepsight.gg, BrayTech, and all the other third-party <em>Destiny 2</em> tools handle <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-outlines-the-final-shapes-new-weapon-enhancement-feature-and-its-good-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming weapon enhancement features</a>, as Bungie appears to be adding a whole new layer of complexity to how the game’s weapons are handled in the backend. Still, it’s a good problem to have, and the sort of stuff that will be widely discussed in the community when the time comes.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">In other related news, I’m thrilled to report that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things have settled down in the <em>Destiny 2</em> community</a> almost across the board, as we approach the release window of <em>The Final Shape</em>. <em>Lightfall</em> didn’t burn through <em>all</em> of the community’s goodwill after all, I suppose!</p>

            <p>
FromSoftware has released a brand new story trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree.
</p>
<p>
The trailer lasts three minutes and provides a fresh look at the story, which for the most part has remained under wraps until now despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-analysed">analysis and speculation on previous trailers</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can watch the trailer in full below.

<p>So what do we see?</p>
<p>"Miquella the kind spoke of the beginning," the narration begins. "The seduction and the betrayal. An affair from which gold arose. And so too was shadow born." That certainly seems to encapsulate the backdrop of the narrative, which is spoken along with images of Miquella walking up bloody steps towards an archway of bloodied bodies, presumably awakening from his slumber.</p>

<p>We witness a war of flames, with plenty of those caged fiery giants from the previous trailer. "A purge without grace or honour, the tyranny of Messmer's flame," says the narration as the big bad presides over the battle. We see another previously seen boss too as eventually the camera pans upwards from the battle in the shadow of the golden erdtree. It seems clear that the golden Miquella and the flaming Messmer are at odds.</p>

<p>The final shot sees the camera pan backwards to reveal a number of characters stood at one of these symbols, the golden erdtree in the background. Are these characters we'll meet along the journey as we follow in Miquella's footsteps? And, in typical Souls fashion, are they not to be trusted? "We choose to follow," speaks the narration. "Will you walk with us?"</p>

<p>
We don't have long to decide now as Shadow of the Erdtree will release next month on 21st June across all platforms and will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">FromSoftware's "largest expansion" ever</a>. It will also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-elden-rings-sole-dlc-but-may-not-be-the-series-end">the sole DLC, but maybe not the end of the series</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the lead up to this new story trailer, the studio has released artwork of some new enemies including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reveals-new-elden-ring-enemy-with-bloodborne-esque-design">Bloodborne-esque enemy with a bulbous golden head</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-features-fearsome-foes-of-unfathomable-power-and-heres-one-of-them">masked creature some have likened to a uterus</a>.

			<p>A new Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree trailer was released online today, providing a new quick look at the highly anticipated expansion.</p>
<p>The new trailer, which can be watched below, focuses on the expansion's story, which takes place in the Land of Shadow, a place obscured by the Erdtree where the goddess Marika first set foot.

<p>With its new locations to explore and new enemies to defeat while taking advantage of new mechanics and weapons, the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is set to improve the Elden Ring experience considerably, which was already excellent to begin with, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>I tried hard to find any faults in Elden Ring, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find any outside of some technical issues that the developers could fix via patches. I firmly believe that perfection doesn't exist and that it is always possible to improve, but I really couldn't think of anything that Elden Ring could have done better. As such, the game wholly deserves a perfect score, an honor I would have given only to a couple of other modern games, not only for its extremely high quality but also for what it accomplished with its open world and for how it will surely influence video games as a whole in the future.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One on June 21st.</p>

The RPG follows Mario and an eclectic group of pals as they hunt for stars on a treasure map to unlock the secret behind the titular Thousand-Year Door. Turn-based combat has you hitting buttons in real-time to make attacks and other techniques more effective, and a badge system lets you experiment with different strategies. Another highlight is the writing, which isn’t afraid to be both funny <em>and</em> weird. And after years of gimmick-driven sequels, the lost GameCube gem offers a purer, more old-school RPG alternative to the likes of <em>Paper Mario: Color Splash </em>and <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em>. </p><p>At the time of this writing, the new release of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> has an 89 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Metacritic</a></span>, and it doesn’t appear to have cut any of the story beats or dialogue that has stuck with fans for decades. But it also doesn’t appear to have added much in the way of new content, making it feel like more of a straight HD port. “<em>The Thousand-Year Door </em>has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG,” wrote  Steven Petite for <em>GameSpot</em>, while at <em>Nintendo Life</em> Alana Hagues <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> that the remaster falls slightly short of last year’s <em>Super Mario RPG </em>when it comes to adding additional gameplay wrinkles. </p><p>Here’s a round-up of what others are saying about <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.</em></p><hr><h3 id="h43183"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Rogueport and its surrounding areas are bursting with personality thanks to writing that’s just as sharp and funny today as it was in 2004. It also introduces a host of modern improvements that streamline (but don’t eliminate) the original’s backtracking issues, easily making this the best way to experience Mario’s quest to gather the Crystal Stars. </p></blockquote><h3 id="h43184"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> <em>The Thousand-Year Door </em>has so many great lines of dialogue that touch on the full range of human emotions that it’s absolutely worth your time to talk to every NPC you encounter and read the messages sent to Mario’s Game Boy Advance SP communication device—there are some real gems in there. A few lines of dark humor actually made my mouth drop, and it’s hard to believe that the words of a Bob-omb with a steering wheel attached to his back got to me more than any game in a long time. There’s even a conversation about the need for renewable energy sources—as a reminder, this game is from 2004.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h43185"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is one of the last times that Mario didn’t feel like a carefully managed pop star, never allowed to appear even remotely unlikable. In <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em>, however, he can be a little prick, should you so choose, telling people to “beat it, loser!” as if a little paper mustachioed man was capable of intimidating anyone. The fact that this game is returning on its 20th anniversary, hot off the heels of a remake of the similarly idiosyncratic and beloved <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, hearkens back to a time when a big Mario game could be for a specific kind of person, and not necessarily for everyone. </p></blockquote><h3 id="h43186"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> If you were hoping that <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> on Nintendo was a thorough remake that redefines a classic, you may come away from this Switch remake disappointed. Thankfully, <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> still holds up 20 years after release, thanks to some hilarious dialogue, timeless visuals, and an approachable RPG battle system. While it’s a bit of a bummer that Nintendo’s 2024 game lineup is mostly comprised of remakes, I’m glad Nintendo is giving <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> a second shot at life. It truly isn’t like any other Mario game out there.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h43187"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/back-and-forward&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/back-and-forward" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Informer</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>For all the annoyances of repeating areas and slow (but engaging) combat, <em>Thousand-Year Door </em>is now a series highlight. It marks the first instance of where I didn’t want a Mario RPG to go (I generally prefer the Mario &amp; Luigi direction), but the constant fourth-wall breaking, myriad colorful and unique characters, and its willingness to just be weird all lead to a joyful journey. I am grateful that this shined-up version of the GameCube classic I missed is finally available on a contemporary platform.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h43188"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>TheGamer</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> To contrast, the next level has you infiltrate a haunted church in order to lift a curse that turns villagers into pigs. It’s giving<em> Majora’s Mask</em>, and the fact that it doesn’t end with the boss battle – the twist here is great – gives it life and vibrancy, despite the dim corridors you explore. The platforming puzzles are clever, but it’s all over too quick. After spending such a long time in the wrestling ring, I was excited to get back to the game proper, and felt shortchanged.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h43189"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.engadget.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-a-switch-remake-mostly-befitting-a-masterpiece-130052569.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.engadget.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-a-switch-remake-mostly-befitting-a-masterpiece-130052569.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Engadget</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s too bad Nintendo had to lower the frame rate down to 30fps from the Gamecube’s silky smooth 60fps, but it’s not the end of the world. If you can enjoy some of the greatest games ever made in 30fps, like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>The Thousand Year Door</em> is no different. The remake also adds enough new graphical elements to make it look better than the original. I’m sure I nailed the game’s timing-based moves more often in 60fps, but they’re still fairly easy to pull off (except for those damn counters).</p></blockquote><h3 id="h43190"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-remake/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Like most <em>Paper Mario</em> games, the narrative is the star here. But where other entries have been let down by their occasionally gimmicky gameplay, <em>Thousand-Year Door</em>’s RPG mechanics remain pleasingly robust and consistently engaging, with players able to battle foes alongside their companions in turn-based battles, and level up their stats upon defeating enough of them. At the time, these systems will have felt staunchly conservative. There’s little here that didn’t feature in the first two <em>Mario RPG</em> games, or indeed a decade of genre classics released before it. But after enduring dozens of tedious <em>Paper Mario </em>reinventions in the years since, it is frankly something of a relief to return to a set of balanced and compelling mechanics, with no stickers, cards, or bags of confetti in sight.﻿</p></blockquote><h3 id="h43191"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>TechRadar</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door’s Nintendo Switch remake demonstrates that the 20-year-old Gamecube role-playing game has aged like a fine wine, barely touching its gameplay elements while offering a stunning glow-up in the visual department. Some may lament the 30fps cap and some rather antiquated backtracking, but it remains a thoroughly charming and engaging experience from start to finish. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FromSoftware has released the story trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahead of the expansion’s release</a> on June 21 for all available platforms. </p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives a glimpse into the player’s journey as they head into the Land of Shadow at the behest of Empyrean Miquella.</p>

<iframe title="Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m55p6BzELb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“In these strange new lands, players discover the dark secrets of the world as they meet others who follow in&nbsp;Miquella’s footsteps with ulterior motives,” the expansion’s description reads.</p>



<p>The expansion will add new weapons, weapon skills, equipment, and magic for players as well as a number of new enemies. As you explore the new area of the Land of Shadow, you’ll be able to “seamlessly travel back and forth” between there and the Lands Between.</p>



<p>When it releases on June 21, Shadow of the Erdtree will cost $39.99. Players will need the base game in order to play the expansion.</p>



<p>After Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring fans shouldn’t expect to see a second expansion for the game. FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-reportedly-wont-get-new-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a recent interview</a> that there wouldn’t be anything else released for Elden Ring. However, there is still the potential of a sequel somewhere down the line.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sadly, we don't see more gameplay or confirmation of what we can expect to experience when playing Shadow of the Erdtree.

It's shaping up to be one of the largest post-launch expansions FromSoftware has ever done (possibly just the largest, period) as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dlcs-map-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-limgrave/1100-6521275/">Shadow of the Erdtree's map is as big or bigger than Limgrave</a>, the first major area in Elden Ring.</p><p dir="ltr">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is set to launch June 21 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-reaffirms-vivian-is-trans-in-its-english-localization.877332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-vivian-trans-localization/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-vivian-trans-localization<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="386" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Reviews for the Nintendo Switch remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> dropped earlier today (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including our own</a>), and they’ve unsurprisingly been overwhelmingly positive. What is surprising, though, is that among the game’s quality-of-life updates includes a revised localization and script, which unambiguously cements the character of Vivian as a transgender woman.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">This was highlighted in <a href="https://youtu.be/3ZPwyfIL_qU?si=EjEbli6vQseViJSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Life’s own video review</a> on the remake, which shows off this line from Vivian that wasn’t present in the original Western release: “Truth is, it took me a while to realize I was their sister… not their brother. Now their usual bullying feels heavier.”</p> <figure data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">For context, Vivian was always written as trans in the original <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em>, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191203073129/https://themushroomkingdom.net/pmttyd_j2e.shtml#vivian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least in the Japanese script</a>. In fact, this was central to Vivian’s character arc as she eventually joins Mario as a party member, having grown sick of her sister Beldam’s insults whereas Mario treats her with kindness. </p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">When the game was localized and released in the West, this aspect was rewritten; Beldam was still a nasty bully who belittled Vivian’s appearance and clumsiness, but any allusions to Vivian’s gender were excised. For the remake, though, the updated script goes out of its way to ensure there’s no room for debate or alternative reading; Vivian is unquestionably trans.</p>
 <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">I’m honestly shocked this has even happened, but it’s awesome nonetheless. Aside from allowing Vivian’s character arc to be fully realized with no compromises, it’s just nice to see more positive trans representation, particularly in a franchise as huge and popular as <em>Super Mario</em>. <a href="https://x.com/Dededaio2/status/1792907310785830917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans of Vivian on Twitter</a> are seeing this as <a href="https://x.com/mrgrizz123/status/1792914541136736456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an absolute win</a>, though they also acknowledge this is going to <a href="https://x.com/BlackeyeThe2nd/status/1792912703927021607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invite the usual tired discourse and outrage</a>. I must reiterate, this isn’t ‘forced diversity’ on the part of the localization team; Vivian is trans in the original Japanese, so this is an accurate translation.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">The remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> was always going to be worth checking out if only for the pedigree of the original. It would’ve received praise for its combat, funny dialogue, pleasing visuals, and quality-of-life updates anyway, but this tiny clarification to the script is a big deal for a lot of people, and one worth celebrating.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking.877329/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="170" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) continues to be one of the most controversial features in first-person shooter titles, and players want to know if it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">Skill-based matchmaking refers to the matchmaking system and algorithms a game uses to find other players.&nbsp;Users are placed in matches based on connection and skill level. After years of silence, Activision finally <a href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/call-of-duty-wrote-1700-words-in-tell-all-skill-based-matchmaking-blog-yet-changed-nothing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in January that SBMM is used in <em>CoD</em>. In defense of SBMM, Activision argued that it set out to create an even experience where the top and bottom players on the scoreboard don’t have too wide of a gap in ability and wins and losses happen regularly for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">However, a segment of highly skilled&nbsp;<em>CoD&nbsp;</em>players argue that SBMM unfairly punishes them, as they are forced to face increasingly difficult opposition if they perform better. The never-ending debate shows no signs of slowing down soon as the feature still dominates conversations. Here is everything you need to know about whether or not it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking" data-injectable="false">Does <em>XDefiant</em> have SBMM (Skill-based matchmaking)?</h2> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant</em> <strong>does not use skill-based matchmaking for its casual playlist</strong>. If players want a more competitive experience, ranked mode will use SBMM. Ranked won’t officially be available at launch, but players can test the 4v4 competitive mode in a ranked mode practice playlist. Ubisoft plans to add a ranked mode in a future season. </p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Instead of matching based on skill, <em>XDefiant</em> puts a priority on fast connection times among a list of other factors. </p>
 <ol data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Latency</li> <li>Blocked Players</li> <li>Party Size</li> <li>Region</li> <li>Input Device</li> <li>Platform</li> </ol> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">In saying that, casual matches do not use skill to determine who gets into a game, but once the lobby is full, <em>XDefiant </em>balances the teams based on skill to ensure a somewhat balanced match. Ranked Play will use the same list of criteria, but rank points and matching players within an acceptable rank range will be the most important determining factor. </p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">“We believe that no SBMM is paramount to a fun and varied game experience in the long-term,” Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>. “Frankly, skill-based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive- constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful and matched as ranked.” </p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="false">Lobby persistence has also been an issue in <em>CoD</em>. <em>XDefiant </em>will test the feature later this year, meaning subsequent games will often include the same group of players from the previous match but will shuffle the users between teams. </p>

<p data-characters="261" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Winning a game of <em>Fortnite</em> is never easy, but some players are convinced that the game’s Zero Build mode has gotten a whole lot harder, with players claiming it’s been “miserable” and that they’re getting “annihilated.”</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">When Zero Build was introduced to <em>Fortnite</em> in March 2022, it provided a safe space for gamers who didn’t enjoy the building aspect of the game, or simply weren’t very good at it. Like many, I ran to the mode and never looked back, and I don’t think I’ve played a build game since. </p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">While I definitely found the mode easier, some players have complained that Zero Build has suddenly become much more difficult, posting about it on the official <em>Fortnite</em> subreddit. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Zero Build made me as happy as this guy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">“In the last few days, the lobbies I am getting are significantly harder,” wrote Professional-Wish116. “I am guessing it’s because I am getting better so being put in harder lobbies. Or is it just what it’s like at the end of a season?”</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">They weren’t alone in this feeling either, with Sweet-Cicada-6971 stating: “My experience is the exact same. Basically since yesterday every game feels like a tournament. People are trying so hard, every game I get blasted by TikTokers on Level 500, it’s crazy,” with YrsaAse saying their experience had been “miserable” and that they “weren’t just losing” but getting “absolutely annihilated.”</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">As for why this is happening, the resounding theory is that with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-update-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5, Season 3</a> starting on May 24, lots of players have returned to the game to rank up their battle passes before they expire. The influx of returning players has then raised the quality of lobbies, making them harder. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="false">Of course, it is possible that Epic Games have tweaked their matchmaking system, but nothing has been announced by the developer so we can’t be sure. We’ll learn more over the next week though as lobbies settle post-update, and we may even hear from Epic if they have made changes. </p>

<p>He's worked with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Crew</em>, and he says he's excited to join Amazon Games in order to get the chance to work on the company's "exciting roadmap".</p>

<p>As well as announcing Pana's stewardship of Amazon Games Bucharest, Amazon also <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/cristian-pana-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released an interview</a> with its new studio head in which he discusses his career, his achievements, and some of the projects he's overseen.</p>

<p>Pana says that the game of which he's most proud is&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, where he headed up the development of post-launch content.</p>

<p>Those layoffs took place against the backdrop of a wider industry trend that has also seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-layoffs-targets-20-of-workforce-resulting-in-1100-jobs-lost">Hasbro</a> letting hundreds of employees go within the last year or so.</p>

<p>Despite that, Amazon still has a pretty stacked slate of upcoming games, with projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-protocol"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, an as-yet untitled&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game, and a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-game-studios-cancels-lord-of-rings-game">no, not that one</a>) currently in the works at the company's gaming division.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where Bucharest slots into Amazon's plans. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24160999/hellblade-2-headphones-audio-engineering<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23992977/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-looks-extremely-intense"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, the first and only instruction the game provides is that the game is <a href="https://youtu.be/nTek6v64bG4?si=bgQ9B4nEIf3SXEYH">best experienced with headphones</a>. Typically, I always ignore that advice. I’m not a “headphones on, lights off” kind of player. I don’t need <em>ambiance. </em>But for <em>Hellblade II</em>, I decided, “Why not?” What followed was an aural <em>experience</em> that thrilled, frightened, and unsettled the Hel(lblade) outta me.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Of course, if, for whatever reason, you can’t play with headphones, the game’s subtitles and closed captioning do good work conveying the game’s unique audio design.</em></p><p>In <em>Hellblade II</em>,<em> </em>the follow-up to 2017’s<em> Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, Senua, a Pict warrior, embarks on another harrowing journey. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">Instead of venturing to the gates of Helheim</a>, she travels north to confront the viking raiders that have been stealing and enslaving her people. On her journey, Senua is accompanied by a Homeric chorus of voices that reflect her struggle with psychosis. The team at Ninja Theory made it a point to explain that they <a href="https://youtu.be/KVBxvlRV0d4?si=-FsKyhWDLqitiAid">consulted with mental health experts</a> — including a professor of psychiatry at Cambridge University and people who live with the disorder — in order to portray psychosis respectfully and accurately. That manifests as hearing voices clip in and out of each side of my headphones. At the beginning of the game, I would whip my head left or right as the voices jumped around before I finally grew used to them. </p><p>There’s a richness to the voice performances that are lost if they’re diffused through open air instead of beamed directly into your ears. They speak in short, staccato sentences, contextualizing Senua’s feelings about a particular encounter. When she meets someone, her voices wonder if they can be trusted. In fights, they shout encouragements and admonitions. “Get up. Get up!” or “They’re so strong!” I like the voices. They remind me of my own rapid-fire internal monologue quipping about the myriad things that flit around in my head.</p><p>Senua’s voices also help with navigation and puzzle solving, but not so much that it becomes obnoxious. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there’s none of that “the dialogue tells you the solution” stuff <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23631177/chatty-video-game-characters-god-of-war-horizon-forbidden-west-high-on-life-forspoken">that happens in other games</a>. For the first puzzle section involving a path blocked by a large symbol, the voices yell “Focus!” prompting you to press the right trigger to engage Senua’s focus ability. When I got lost during a particularly bewildering section in a dark forest, the voices remarked only once that I was lost then shut up, leaving me to figure out the solution in blessed silence.</p><p>In delving into a drained lake, I could hear water dripping all around me as the caverns echoed with the sound of my breathing. The further I traveled, the darker it got, and the more sinister the sounds became. My breathing slowly transformed into the guttural sounds of disquieted spirits. That should have been a problem. I <em>hate</em> the sounds typically associated with horror — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/21/23416630/scorn-h-r-giger-xbox-game-pass-horror-game">that crawling, squelching sound</a> used whenever a game or movie wants to convey that something’s gross and wet. But the scary sounds in <em>Hellblade II</em> never crossed the threshold into repulsive or triggering for me (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/5/14497584/misophonia-eating-sound-brain-scan-fmri">misophonia sufferers</a>, rejoice). Instead, the sounds were soft and quiet but no less sinister, sounding as though they were just over my shoulder in the real world.</p><div><figcaption><em>When audio enhances visual, </em>Hellblade II<em> becomes a harrowing experience.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ninja Theory</cite></p></div><p>My aural journey with <em>Hellblade II </em>wasn’t limited to sound effects and voices. The music also played an integral role in crafting a visceral full-body experience with the game. Early on, there’s an encounter where it all combines — music, sound effects, and voices — to create a goose bump-inducing moment that I won’t spoil. The tempo of the music combined with the on-screen action created a beat that I could physically feel reverberating in my chest as I played. It’s a game-defining moment that really nails the skill and creativity of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s sound team. </p><p>I’m an aural person, someone who places great emphasis on sound, and <em>Hellblade II</em> felt like it was a game made for me. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there is no in-game UI. There are no tutorial pop-ups that pause the action to tell you what buttons do what or how to interact with the environment. A UI adds a layer of artificiality, reminding you that you that this is make-believe. Without it, the game created a level of reality that I’ve never really experienced before, forcing me to fully inhabit Senua as a character. And with headphones in, I heard so much more of the world and got a greater feeling for Senua’s unique experience in it. </p><p><small><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> is out now on Xbox and Game Pass. </small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nintendo has acquired known porting studio Shiver Entertainment from Embracer - the studio behind the recent Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 Switch ports.</p>
<p>The acquisition was <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> through an official press release earlier today. Following the acquisition, Nintendo will obtain 100% of the outstanding shares of Shiver to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese gaming behemoth. As mentioned above, Shiver has been working on the recent Switch versions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-switch-looks-performs-well-caveats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Software's Hogwarts Legacy</a> and NetherRealm's Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>"By welcoming Shiver’s experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles", the press release reads. "Going forward, even after it becomes a part of the Nintendo group, Shiver’s focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1792730561708204474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by Bloomberg journalist Takashi Mochizuki on X, many see the acquisition as a way for Nintendo to strengthen resources available for third-party devs to bring more high-end titles to the recently confirmed Nintendo Switch 2, which is expected to arrive sometime next year.</p>
<p>During Nintendo's most<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recent earnings call</a> with investors, President Shuntaro Furukawa talked about expansion, pointing out that acquisitions might be part of the company's strategy, although the focus is expanding via recruitment of recent graduates and mid-career hires. "Although development resources could be expanded through M&amp;A, first we will work within the company with our developers, who thoroughly understand and have built up the Nintendo brand over the years, to have them nurture talent who can drive Nintendo's future development", Furukawa said. "In addition, many of our external development partners have gained a deep understanding of Nintendo's way of thinking and game development methods over the many years of collaboration, and we would like to further strengthen our ties with such partners."</p>
