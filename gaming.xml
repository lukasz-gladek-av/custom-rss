            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have always had an adversarial relationship with alarm clocks. They are gadgets designed to ruin my most precious time, and in order to work effectively, they must be as annoying as possible. Which is why I was intrigued by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo’s surprise reveal of Alarmo</a>. (Once I got over my surprise of it not being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">the long-awaited Switch 2 announcement</a>.) What if getting up in the morning could be a little more playful? Maybe what I really needed all along was Princess Zelda’s soothing voice or the chirps of tiny pikmin to ease me into consciousness in the morning.</p><p>After a week with Alarmo, I have to admit that it hasn’t changed much about my sleep patterns. It has some clever ideas, and it looks great on a shelf, but ultimately, it’s still an alarm clock.</p><p>But what a cute alarm clock it is. Alarmo is a red cylinder with a rotund white button / knob on top and a 2.8-inch rectangular LCD display with a big ol’ bezel around it that makes it <em>almost</em> seem circular, particularly in the dark. You can pick one of (currently) five different games — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799072/pikmin-4-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pikmin 4</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a> — to customize how the clockface looks and sounds, so that Link or Captain Olimar can walk around the screen. It’s the kind of thing that’s just nice to look at, and the characters even follow you around when you move in front of it.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Alarmo has a number of Nintendo-ized alarm features. You can choose from 35 video game “scenes” to wake up to, which range from Zelda calmly saying “wake up” to, for some reason, the sound of a pikmin drowning. Each scene starts out relatively chill and will get progressively more intense the longer you stay in bed. The top button will even start flashing colors to get your attention. Alarmo lets you customize the alarm schedule by day of the week, and it tracks your daily sleep times along with how long it takes you to actually wake up after your alarm goes off each day. All of this info is available on the clock itself; it doesn’t sync with other devices or apps.</p><p>Navigating the device is pretty easy: for most things, you simply smack the big button on top. This works for everything from turning a blaring alarm off in the morning to opening the menu to tweak settings. Otherwise, you can twist the button to adjust things — like picking the time for your alarm to go off — and there are also back and notification buttons. (So far, my notifications have all been informing me of existing Alarmo features, but in the future, it will be used to alert users for updates to add more sounds and styles based on games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>. This does require linking an existing Nintendo account to the device, the only real online feature I’ve encountered so far.)</p><p>But you shouldn’t be spending much time with those buttons because Alarmo’s big hook — aside from its Nintendo style — is its millimeter wave motion sensor. The idea is that you can interact with it simply by moving around. When it goes off in the morning, rolling out of the bed is enough to shut the alarm off. Wave your hand around a little, and it will snooze for a few minutes. In my experience, it works well enough, but with one big caveat: Alarmo’s motion sensors can’t distinguish between multiple people. So if I get out of bed but my partner sleeps in, the alarm won’t shut off.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>To be fair, Nintendo notes this issue right on the box (apparently animals can cause issues as well), but it does make the experience a lot less interesting if you share a bed. For most of the week, I’ve had to resort to getting up and turning the alarm off manually so that I don’t get in trouble for ruining my wife’s sleep with loud <em>Splatoon</em> splatters. Of course, given that a large part of the intended audience is children, this won’t be a problem for many people. Then again, my own children didn’t care much for any of the alarm or sleep tracking features anyway; they just thought it was cool having Mario on a clock. Note: this did not make it any easier to wake them up on school days.</p><p>You can also use Alarmo to help you fall back asleep. If you have a bedtime set, soothing sounds will start playing as soon as you get into bed, based on one of the five supported games (again, no button-pressing required). It has worked flawlessly for me, and I’ve become hooked on the<em> Zelda</em> nighttime theme, with its crackling fire and soft, intermittent piano. It’s like I’m dozing off in Hyrule Field after dark. But again, there’s an annoying caveat. For some inexplicable reason, the sounds only play for less than 10 minutes before going silent, so if you’re looking for Nintendo-themed white noise, you are out of luck. Hyrule is gone almost as soon as I finally get comfortable.</p><p>Those kinds of quirks make the actual sleep features of Alarmo feel like more of an afterthought. It’s first and foremost a $100 Nintendo-branded clock. It looks and sounds the part, which is to say, it’s incredibly charming and nostalgic. But if you’re looking for something to help you wake up better than a run-of-the-mill alarm or track your sleep more efficiently than an app on your phone, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23449363/best-android-smartwatches-wear-os">this isn’t it</a>. Turns out, even adorable pikmin and inklings can’t change my mind about alarm clocks.</p><p><small>Alarmo is </small><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F"><small>available to purchase early now</small></a><small> for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and will be released in early 2025 for everyone else.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Call of Duty series looks set to take players back to the future in 2025 with a Black Ops 2 sequel set in the early 2030s.</p><p>Fans were alerted to leaked information about next year’s unannounced Call of Duty game after details allegedly revealed in a focus group meeting hit <a href="https://x.com/ForwardLeaksAlt/status/1847017923409256928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>. Some of these details were then corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a>. Activision declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p>While 2024’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> is set in the 90s to the backdrop of the Gulf War, 2025’s Black Ops game reportedly shoots forward to the 2030s, picking up where 2012’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii">Black Ops 2</a>, set in 2025, left off.</p><p>It reportedly continues the Black Ops storyline from that point, with David Mason from Black Ops 2 as the protagonist. Mechanics from Black Ops 6 said to return include the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-a-new-feature-fans-are-saying-will-get-people-banned-or-make-them-go-viral-or-both">body shield</a> and Omnimovement, with some tweaks such as human shields with grenades stuck to them that can be thrown at enemies, and wall jumping. Zombies mode, meanwhile, is said to introduce an eight-player mode.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Infinity Ward is reportedly hard at work on the next Modern Warfare game, presumably Modern Warfare 4. Perhaps that’s due out in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Developer Treyarch has had four years to work on Black Ops 6, the longest development period of a mainline Call of Duty game yet. Expectations are high then after 2023’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023"><u>Modern Warfare 3</u></a>, which is perhaps the most poorly received campaign in Call of Duty history. (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-dev-raven-didnt-react-to-modern-warfare-3-campaigns-terrible-reception-we-were-already-pretty-locked-in">Black Ops 6 campaign developer Raven told IGN it didn’t react to the Modern Warfare 3 campaign’s terrible reception</a>.)</p><p>Modern Warfare 3, originally conceived as an expansion pack for 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022"><u>Modern Warfare 2</u></a>, reportedly imposed crunch on its developers as they battled to create a fully-fledged sequel in just 16 months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty"><u>Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon has insisted Modern Warfare 3 was “years in the making.”</u></a></p><p>Assuming the reports of next year’s Call of Duty being another Black Ops game hot on the heels of this year’s Black Ops 6 are true, Activision will once again face tough questions around its value as a fully-fledged sequel.</p><p>In the shorter term, Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 and straight into Game Pass. It’s the first Call of Duty game to do so since Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. For more, we've got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, a three-player co-op FPS set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Control</em>. It's due to land on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>
<p>We've known about&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>for some time, although not under that name. Remedy first announced a multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-working-on-multiplayer-control-and-bigger-sequel">all the way back in 2021</a>; at that point, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-condor-is-multiplayer-control-spinoff-from-remedy-and-505">known as Project Condor</a>.</p>
<p>The game began as a collaboration between Remedy and 505 Games, but since Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the rights</a> to the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>franchise from 505 earlier this year, it will instead serve as the studio's first self-published project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-2025-control-multiplayer-spinoff-soldier.jpg?itok=tNKY4Im5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-2025-control-multiplayer-spinoff-soldier.jpg?itok=ajXYcuay 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is officially on the way to PC and consoles next year.</figcaption></figure><p>A trademark for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>was first filed by Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">back in January</a>, fueling speculation (which has now proved correct) that this would be the final name for&nbsp;<em>Project Condor</em>.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-entertainment-unveils-fbc-firebreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Remedy</a>,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>will be a "mid-priced" co-op shooter in which you and your buddies play as members of Firebreak, an "adaptable response unit" sent by the Federal Bureau of Control to break a "deadly and prolonged siege by otherworldly forces".</p>
<p>The game will be split into different missions, and before each mission, you'll build a loadout from "specialized tools, grenades, support items, and paranatural augments", customizing them to create an approach that works for you.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, which also shows off some of the game's high-octane first-person shooter gameplay, right here.</p>

<p>Remedy says that you can enjoy&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>whether you've played&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>or not; it serves as a "standalone multiplayer experience" that brings an "entirely new perspective" to the world of&nbsp;<em>Control</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't all that's coming from Remedy on the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>front, either; a full-blown sequel to the game is also in the works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies">as a collaboration with Annapurna</a>, alongside TV and movie projects, although it's unclear whether Annapurna's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail">game department imploding</a> will affect these plans in any way.</p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025. It'll also arrive on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">certain Game Pass tiers</a> and as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium members on day one.</p>

<p>The top youngsters you need to focus on signing in EA FC 25 are <strong>Mustafa Hekimoglu</strong> as a forward, <strong>Franco Mastantuono</strong> as a midfielder, <strong>Finn Jeltsch</strong> as a defender, and <strong>Dennis Seimen</strong> as a goalkeeper. These players are young and affordable—great for all budgets—and become world-beaters in their respective positions.</p>



<p>For an even deeper look at EA FC 25’s Career Mode best wonderkids, we’ve broken down every area of the pitch and rounded up the top talents you need to sign.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-goalkeeper-wonderkids-to-sign-in-ea-fc-25-career-mode">Best Goalkeeper Wonderkids to Sign in EA FC 25 Career Mode</h2>



<p>While everyone wants to chase exciting strikers or midfield dominators, never underestimate the importance of a top goalkeeper. After all, it doesn’t matter how many you score, if you keep conceding, you won’t win many matches. An agile goalkeeper with catlike reflexes and immaculate distribution is a recipe for success. So, consider these youngsters for the position between the sticks.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-defender-wonderkids-to-sign-in-ea-fc-25-career-mode">Best defender wonderkids to sign in EA FC 25 Career Mode</h2>



<p>The value of a top GK is undeniable, but it helps if you have a rock wall of defense to protect them. Defensive formations come in all shapes and sizes in modern-day football, but each defense usually consists of at least two center-backs, with either full-backs or wing-backs flanking the sides. Some of these defenders may be kids, but a legend in the making lies dormant.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-midfielder-wonderkids-to-sign-in-ea-fc-25-career-mode">Best midfielder wonderkids to sign in EA FC 25 Career Mode</h2>



<p>From CDM destroyers to playmaking number tens, midfielders are versatile and are the heartbeat of a football team. Without a good midfield, you have no attack, and your defence is regularly under siege. Unearthing the next Claude Makélélé to wrestle back possession or the new Kevin de Bruyne to orchestrate your play should be a big priority—and our list should help you out.</p>

		<p>The bird &amp; bear are back, with Banjo-Tooie, their second Nintendo 64 adventure, flapping onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 64™ – October 2024 Game Update – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJgHERWE_eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/19/banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-library-20-january/">almost three years after the first game was added</a>, Banjo-Tooie will be available in the N64 app for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers from 25th October. It’s the first time that this has been available through a Nintendo emulation system, which is pretty exciting for those who missed out on the original, or don’t have an Xbox for Rare Replay.</p>
<p>Originally released for N64 in 2000 (and in April 2001 in the EU), Banjo-Tooie was at the tail end of the N64 generation and was in many ways the culmination of Rare’s time with the 3D platformer genre – Conker’s Bad Fur Day was a lewd fever dream that came out the following year, and bizarrely a week before the EU release of Tooie.</p>
<p>Building on the original game’s riff on the Super Mario 64 formula, and filled with a collect-a-thon of Jigglies and musical notes, Banjo-Tooie takes things to the next level in a number of ways. Rare was able to bring back some cut content and ideas from the original, but pushing the N64 even harder by featuring direct connections between its worlds for a more contiguous adventure, where the original had you teleport into each level. That’s featured in some of the game’s puzzles, which span multiple worlds.</p>

<p>The game also features multiplayer for four players, adapting the competition mode from the single-player to give first-person shooting, football and other minigames. It’s not entirely clear that this is included in the Switch Online version, but will be interesting to see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-due-to-hit-early-access-in-2025-co-op-play-confirmed.1013367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and Unknown Worlds have revealed that long-awaited survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is officially due to land in Early Access next year, and that the game will incorporate an oft-requested co-op feature.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Xbox Partner Preview showcase, Krafton and Unknown Worlds showed off the first official&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>teaser, and while it didn't give much away about the game, the Steam page and various other listings were also updated to reveal more.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, you'll play as "a pioneer traveling to a distant world", and you'll have to explore a brand new aquatic alien world brimming with resources to gather, biomes to discover, and unique creatures to...well, to swim away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=J-xELovL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=UI9eZEAt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will bring...what the hell is that? It'll bring whatever the hell that is.</figcaption></figure><p>More Leviathans will be lying in wait to ambush you, of course, and you'll also discover "diverse ecosystems", although rather mysteriously, Unknown Worlds says "something isn't right" with this world, asking "what happened here? What happened to you? And more importantly, where are you?".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-2024-live-service">previously revealed by Unknown Worlds</a>,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will feature optional co-op play for up to four players, but the developer is keen to emphasize that you can also play alone if you prefer.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give away much about the game or what its story will be, but it does show off a couple of interesting-looking creatures, and it features a sound effect that will probably trigger some "fond" memories if you've played the first game.</p>

<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be the first "proper" sequel to 2018's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>. That game was followed up by a sort of sequel-come-expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em>, in 2021, but&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2 </em>looks to be&nbsp;more of a full-blooded followup.</p>
<p>Whether the new game will follow the more narrative-led approach of&nbsp;<em>Below Zero&nbsp;</em>or the open-ended exploration of the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in Early Access in 2025.</p>

We said: “Underbaked, rehashed, and cobbled together from multiplayer parts, Modern Warfare 3’s single-player campaign is everything a Call of Duty story mode shouldn’t be.” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> added: “Clearly rushed to market, Modern Warfare 3's campaign tapes together ill-conceived open areas, underwhelming linear missions, and a meaningless story.” In short, it was all a bit of a disaster.</p><p>A year later and Call of Duty fans are yet again faced with another campaign from the first-person shooter behemoth, this time the Raven Software-developed <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> campaign. IGN has just reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever">how Black Ops 6 is set to offer the most varied Call of Duty campaign ever</a>, but did Raven tweak anything in response to the reaction to Modern Warfare 3, or perhaps learn any lessons from Modern Warfare 3’s campaign?</p><p>Not so, Jon Zuk, associate creative director at Raven Software, told IGN in an interview.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“The campaign… all game development is very fluid and we react to a lot of different things, but in the case of the previous game’s reception, we were already pretty locked in on the story we were telling and the missions we were creating,” Zuk said. “So we didn't react to how that was received.”</p><p>One key point of difference between the developments of Modern Warfare 3, led by Sledgehammer Games, and Black Ops 6, led by Treyarch, is time. Modern Warfare 3, originally conceived as an expansion pack for 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022">Modern Warfare 2</a>, reportedly imposed crunch on its developers as they battled to create a fully-fledged sequel in just 16 months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty">Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon has insisted Modern Warfare 3 was “years in the making.”</a></p><p>Black Ops 6, however, has enjoyed a longer development time than any other mainline Call of Duty game. Treyarch has worked on it for four years, ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a> came out in 2020. And for the campaign, Raven too has benefited from this extra time.</p><p>“The extra development time certainly gives us time to do a little bit more prototyping and a little bit more trying something out, finding out if it's fun and if it works and throwing some things away,” Zuk explained.</p><p>“When you have the shorter development cycle, sometimes you're stuck with things just for the time crunch that maybe you aren't as happy with as you could be. So I do feel like we had good opportunities to keep crafting and recrafting the missions until we were happy with them.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.</p></div><p>Players can also expect Black Ops 6’s campaign to be longer than Cold War’s, Zuk confirmed, although your mileage may vary depending on how much time you spend back at your safehouse hub.</p><p>“You can go back, you can talk to your team, you can upgrade your weapon and your equipment and things like that,” Zuk said. “And you can do a little bit of searching around the safehouse , but there's players who are going to do all of that, and there's players who are going to do none of that and are just, I want to get to the next mission as quickly as possible.</p><p>“So I think that the game length is going to be variable from player to player, but even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6 is of course the first Call of Duty game to launch straight into Game Pass</a>, Microsoft’s subscription service. It comes after Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for an eye-watering $69 billion, and has sparked a debate about whether the move will cannibalize sales of the game.</p><p>But will launching straight into Game Pass have a meaningful impact on the number of people who play Black Ops 6’s campaign? Unlike with previous Call of Duty games, Activision is not releasing an early access campaign for Black Ops 6, which means everyone jumps in at the same time from October 25.</p><p>Zuk said that from Raven’s perspective, it’s trusting owner and publisher Activision to do what’s best for the game. “I have no input in the business side of that at all,” Zuk replied. “The decision was made to not do early access this year, and I trust that Activision has thought out every bit of this and is very confident in the success of the title.”</p><p>We've also got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-launching-with-170-gam/1100-6482120/" data-ref-id="1100-6482120">launched Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> in 2020 with great fanfare, but the company's stated goal to push cloud gaming even further has run into some technological setbacks as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-apple-sparring-again-over-cloud-gaming-apps/1100-6526265/" data-ref-id="1100-6526265">ongoing conflicts with Google and Apple</a> over multiple issues. But now a new report indicates that Microsoft is making a renewed effort to extend the reach of Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>A report released earlier this month stated that Microsoft will soon be testing its ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-soon-let-players-stream-all-their-games-not-just-those-on-game-pass-report/1100-6527140/" data-ref-id="1100-6527140">let Xbox owners stream any game in their library</a> even if it isn't on Game Pass. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272630/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-future-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, that's just the beginning of Microsoft's plans. The company is reportedly looking to add even more cloud-gaming features and introduce direct-to-cloud controllers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEulk3Ar00I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NEulk3Ar00I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The report credits the developer of the Better xCloud app for discovering Xbox's direct-to-cloud controller support, which apparently isn't quite ready to be rolled out yet. For now, Microsoft's priority is said to be focused on improving the visual quality of its streams in a bid to make it possible to play Xbox games without a console that can perform at the same level as the Xbox Series X|S. There will supposedly be forward momentum for allowing higher bitrates on Xbox Cloud Gaming "soon." However, fixing and upgrading Xbox Cloud Gaming's ongoing latency issues will reportedly take more time and "require more powerful hardware."</p><p>If Microsoft can deliver on all of those changes and give console-free gamers a comparable or better experience to having an Xbox Series X|S, then it seems likely to further erode the sales of physical consoles. Microsoft and Sony have both released digital-only consoles this generation, but if Microsoft really can remove the need for a physical console altogether then that might shake up the industry even more--although it didn't work so well for Google's Stadia.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another Nintendo 64 addition to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're a fan of classic Rare 3D platformers, then you're going to love this one.</p>
<p>Per Nintendo itself,&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack lineup on October 25th, so between that and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-dlc-character-vikala-revealed">new&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising&nbsp;</em>DLC fighter</a>, you should have plenty to keep you busy next week.</p>
<p><em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>joins the original&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, which was added to Switch Online's N64 contingent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/banjo-kazooie-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-today-with-the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-up-next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in 2022</a>. If you've been waiting all this time to play the sequel, then hey, now's your chance!</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, it's a sequel to Rare's 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and it sees the titular bear and bird returning to once again do battle with the evil witch Gruntilda.</p>
<p><em>Banjo-Tooie</em>'s levels are much larger than those of&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and there's a lot more to discover in them as well. Many of the levels are interconnected, so you may not be able to collect everything within one stage until you've visited another.</p>
<p>The game also features several new moves for Banjo and Kazooie to learn, as well as new gameplay styles, including&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>-esque first-person shooter segments and the ability to play as the shaman Mumbo Jumbo.</p>

<p>Nintendo's announcement comes just as the company gears up to begin playtesting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest">mysterious new</a> Switch Online feature, the playtest for which begins the day before&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to land on the subscription service.</p>
<p>It also comes just a couple of days after the fresh reveal of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025">Analogue 3D</a>, a reimagined version of the Nintendo 64 that plays original cartridges with no emulation required.</p>
<p>If you're a 3D platformer fan, you can also look forward to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playtonicgames.com/news/announcing-yooka-replaylee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em></a>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Banjo&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>that's set to debut sometime in the future.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>A Call of Duty exploit has surfaced online, revealing that the RICOCHET anti-cheat has falsely banned thousands of players. </p>



<p>How the exploit works was uploaded by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1847024778600689706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@zebleerpo</a>, which revealed how the RICOCHET anti-cheat was being abused by people who wanted to get others banned. The TL;DR is that the words “Trigger Bot” sent to users as messages or even as a part of an online ID in a Friend Request will activate RICHOCHET and ban innocent players.</p>



<p>Activision apparently learned of the exploit before it was uploaded to X and announced that it had “restored all accounts” to a “small number of legitimate player accounts.” It’s currently unclear how many accounts were legitimately affected. </p>



<p>One such account was that of popular streamer <a href="https://x.com/BobbyPoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BobbyPoff</a>, who has now been unbanned and has been a punching bag of accusations and abuse for the past several weeks. </p>



<p>One issue that the original poster points out is that legitimate cheaters might also be unbanned depending on how RICOCHET is unbanning players. “Real cheaters who were caught by these signatures will get unbanned,” they said. </p>



<p>RICOCHET has said that it will have a new blog up later today on the Road to Launch ‘Progress Report’ of its anti-cheat system, so we’ll update readers later today.</p>

            <p>Sony has lost its fight to prevent third party add-ons being sold for PlayStation games.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice has dismissed Sony's claim that the Action Replay cheat software sold by UK company Datel infringed its copyright.</p>
<p>PlayStation asserted that as Datel's boosts use its source code, the company was infringing its copyright under EU law. The case was first taken to court back in 2012.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/17/eu-court-upholds-right-to-sell-playstation-add-ons-in-loss-for-sony-datel-game-mods">EuroNews</a>, judges said that Datel's cheats do "not change or reproduce either the object code, the source code, or the internal structure and organisation of Sony's software", but "merely changes the content of the variables temporarily transferred by Sony’s games to the console's RAM, which are used during the running of the game".</p>
<p>"The directive protects only the intellectual creation as it is reflected in the text of the computer program's source code and object code," the court said.</p>
<p>"The Court finds that the content of the variable data transferred by a computer program to the RAM of a computer and used by that program in its running does not fall within the protection specifically conferred by that directive, in so far as that content does not enable such a program to be reproduced or subsequently created."
</p>
<p>In a non-binding opinion prepared for the case earlier this year, Advocate General Maciej Szpunar insisted it was not illegal to use any copyrighted work in a way that may differ from the creator's intentions.</p>
<p>"The author of a detective novel cannot prevent the reader from skipping to the end of the novel to find out who the killer is, even if that would spoil the pleasure of reading and ruin the author's efforts to maintain suspense," Szpunar said.</p><p>Yesterday we reported that former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden - who served as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of Worldwide Studios before leaving the company in 2019 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-playstation-exec-says-console-makers-need-to-compete-on-content-instead-of-fighting-over-teraflops">was asked if the console industry's current business model was sustainable</a>, given the increasing development costs associated with the ongoing pursuit of incrementally more powerful hardware.</p>
<p>"We've done these things this way for 30 years," Layden replied, "every generation those costs went up and we realigned with it. We've reached the precipice now, where the centre can't hold, we cannot continue to do things that we have done before."</p></div>

            <p>Sony has released its new customisable Welcome Hub for PlayStation 5 in the UK.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ps5-system-update-adds-customisable-welcome-hub">announced the software update back in September</a>, with a rollout "over the coming weeks" - now it's available here.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub appears on the home screen and provides an at-a-glance look at various elements, all through customisable widgets.</p>

<p>For instance, you can now quickly see who from your friends list is online, how much battery is left in your controller, messages received, how much storage space is left, you current trophies, and more.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar to US users, the Welcome Hub is essentially a reworked version of the Explore tab previously only available in that country.</p>

<p>Users can also select from a number of backgrounds for the tab, including animated options or screenshots, and widgets are easily enabled or disabled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-might-finally-get-improved-bitrates-soon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this month, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft is finally allowing users to stream their own games through Xbox Cloud Gaming next month. Now, Warren has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272630/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-future-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> additional information on Microsoft's plans for Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>
<p>The cloud streaming service formerly known as Project XCloud has long lagged behind its competitors in terms of latency and quality. Whereas NVIDIA GeForce NOW started offering 4K resolution support <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-4k-to-pc-and-mac-3-new-star-wars-games-120-fps-support-to-more-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years ago</a> and Boosteroid has followed suit recently, Xbox Cloud Gaming is still limited to 1080p resolution with low bitrates, resulting in much worse visuals.</p>
<p>According to Warren, Microsoft is taking steps to improve the bitrates soon, which will certainly help with visual clarity. However, he did not mention an actual resolution improvement, so it's possible Xbox Cloud Gaming will remain stuck at 1080p for a while yet. Moreover, he noted that any latency improvement would have to be tied to an upgrade in the server hardware. It didn't sound like that would happen any time soon.</p>
<p>Warren also commented on two work-in-progress features that were sort of leaked by the creator of <a href="https://better-xcloud.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better XCloud</a>, a free and open source application that improves the XCloud experience on various devices. The first feature is <a href="https://x.com/redphx/status/1838509481371799905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Together</a>, a way to play games and hang out with friends while inside a browser. The second is a <a href="https://x.com/redphx/status/1821329541476053075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct-to-cloud controller</a> that could cut on the latency, just like the Google Stadia controller did. According to Warren, while both features were being tested internally, Xbox Together was really just a 'hackathon project' that is unlikely to ever be released to the public. The direct-to-cloud controller thing is still being worked on, though, and might be launched at some point.</p>
<p>Overall, Warren reckons Microsoft is once again working hard on Xbox Cloud Gaming. It was, after all, the key in their plan to reach a much bigger audience than what's otherwise possible just with consoles and PCs. To that end, earlier this week, they proudly <a href="https://wccftech.com/stream-three-call-of-duty-games-with-game-pass-from-25-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Call of Duty: Warzone will all be available for cloud streaming for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>

<p>Vikala will be released on October 25th. She joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-new-dlc-character-vanes-release-date-and">Vane</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-first-look-at-beatrix-and-vane-dlc-characters">Beatrix</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-2b-from-nier-automata-dlc-on-top-of-vane-and"><em>Nier: Automata</em>'s 2B</a> as downloadable fighters (although the latter is sadly not likely to be documented on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-cease-and-desist-square-enix">Yoko Taro fansite Accord's Library</a> anytime soon).</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;Vikala, she's one of&nbsp;<em>Granblue</em>'s Twelve Divine Generals, and she's constantly in a battle between two sides of her personality, one of which wants to bring joy to the world while the other wants to be left alone.</p>

<p>As her introductory trailer closes, we see her performing before an adoring crowd, dancing atop a golden mousetrap with sharp jaws and demonstrating the two warring sides of her personality.</p>
<p>Picking up Vikala's DLC pack gets you not only the character, but also a new premium avatar for use within the game, as well as a badge and several Figure Studio poses and expressions.</p>
<p>You can check out Vikala's debut trailer, which gives a sense of how she's going to play when she lands in&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising&nbsp;</em>next week, right here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, it's a sequel-to-slash-rework-of 2020's&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Rising&nbsp;</em>is a fighting game created by&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>dev Arc System Works.</p>
<p><em>Rising&nbsp;</em>brings new mechanics and new characters to the table, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-input-changes">controversial new control changes</a> that were intended to make the game more palatable to a wider audience.</p>
<p><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising&nbsp;</em>is available right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2157560/Granblue_Fantasy_Versus_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-standard-edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

<p>Keywords Studios has acquired Certain Affinity.</p>



<p>The news comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/keywords-acquires-halo-co-developer-certain-affinity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, which says that Keywords Studios acquired Certain Affinity for an undisclosed sum. The report reveals that the acquisition is subject to losing conditions and includes an upfront cash purchase and an earn-out component based on Certain Affinity’s performance.</p>



<p>Certain Affinity will be Keywords Studios’ acquisition this year after it also purchased Wushu Studios in August.</p>



<p>Certain Affinity was first founded in 2006 by former Bungie employees and has since seen the studio work on games, including Call of Duty, Halo, Hogwarts Legacy, and more. Just this week, a former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-cancelled-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Certain Affinity developer claimed that the studio’s Halo Battle Royale</a> “could have been a game changer.”</p>



<p>Certain Affinity was once also developing a Transformers game, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-certain-affinitys-transformers-mmo-has-moved-to-splash-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved over to Splash Damage after a turbulent development</a>. </p>



<p>“At this most difficult time in the market, we’re thrilled to be able to provide stability and a supportive home for our team,” said Hoberman in a statement. “The respect for our talent and culture that Keywords has shown, along with a willingness to invest in our growth, is unparalleled.</p>



<p>“Paul and I look forward to partnering with them to chart a course for careful expansion of our core co-development activities, refinement of our lead development capabilities, as well as championing the growth of the Create division.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Call of Duty’s greatest campaigns have offered one thing over all else: variety. Whether it’s the original Modern Warfare’s memorable behind-enemy-lines sniping of All Ghillied Up or Cold War’s KGB infiltration and hallucinogenic episodes, it’s those missions that take you out of the standard first-person shooter cadence that foremost stick in the memory. While we’re yet to play it, it’s therefore encouraging that Black Ops 6 is aiming to pack its campaign full of these moments, so much so Jon Zuk, associate creative director at Raven Software, tells me it's treating each of the levels as “its own mini blockbuster”. </p><p>Indeed, Call of Duty is at its best when presented as playable cinema. Tense, tight corridor shootouts open up into large-scale explosive set pieces and one-off experiments – not dissimilar to how Mario platformers introduce ideas for individual levels but with AC-130 gunships instead of animal costumes. Set against the backdrop of the Gulf War in 1991, Black Ops 6 is playing in the shadowy political grey areas that lend themselves to spycraft and subterfuge. So while the campaign will undoubtedly have its louder moments, it's given Raven more scope to experiment with different styles of gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“We wanted to make sure that each one was memorable and could stand alone,” says lead narrative producer Natalie Pohorski, talking about missions in Black Ops 6. “Each one has unique gameplay opportunities, unique objectives, and how you tackle those.” It’s a sentiment Jon Zuk agrees with, adding, “We didn't want to just create three or four levels that are fun to play, but all kind of feel the same. We wanted to make sure each mission had its thing, its own special, unique sauce to it, as it were. So variety was number one throughout the entire process for us.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Variety was number one throughout the entire process for us.</p></div><p>Variety has always been a priority for Raven when it comes to designing COD campaigns. There have always been interesting ideas hidden away, even in the games that are less fondly remembered. It’s something that Zuk, who has been at the studio since 1996, recalls as being a key aspect of their gameplay design:</p><p>“That's always been something that we've really been interested in doing. Federation Day back on Ghosts really had the variety. The ‘looking at your target from afar, then zip lining, then repelling on the side of the building and then doing some sneaking or combat and then full-on combat and then a big epic moment to end the level’.” </p><p>Zuk also cites a chapter near the end of the original Black Ops as one of his favourite Call of Duty missions. Rebirth tells its tale from two separate perspectives as the player takes control of Woods and Hudson at different points in time during the same event. “It really intrigued me because it's like telling a story from two different perspectives and kind of seeing that your version of the truth is not always the truth or that the truth is malleable.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The truth and deciphering just who to believe is at the crux of Black Ops 6’s story, but this isn’t the only aspect borrowed from this particular 14-year-old mission. High Rollers looks set to be one of 6’s tentpole levels - a high-risk heist with a casino vault as its target. Players take control of multiple members of the team as they switch perspectives over its course, creating distraction opportunities and executing security breaches in tandem. While not offering the malleable nature that something like GTA V did with its multiple-protagonist heists, it does open up the playbook for fun storytelling possibilities for Raven.</p><p>“Ahead of time they have the mission briefing where they're each like, okay, I'm going to do this, you’re going to do this, you’re going to do this,” explains Pohorski. “They're all undercover, and it's sort of like a passing of the baton is really how it plays out.” </p><p>“What we wanted to tell there was kind of the perfect heist mission where everybody's doing their part and so there's a very particular plan that's taking place and you've got all of the characters taking place or taking part in this and it's got to work in a certain clockwork type fashion for them to pull off this event”, Zuk confirms.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What we wanted to tell there was kind of the perfect heist mission where everybody's doing their part.</p></div><p>That briefing takes place in the expanded mansion hideout you’ll get to explore in Black Ops 6, an evolution of Cold War’s safehouse location that lets you talk to other characters, uncover secrets by exploring, and interact with the all-important evidence board.</p><p>Another distinctive element of Cold War was its willingness to let you holster your weapon for an extended amount of time – a virtually alien idea compared to the majority of what Call of Duty stands for. A prime example of this was the memorable mission Desperate Measures, which had you infiltrate a high-security KGB building, talking your way through checkpoints and wearing disguises as Raven fully embraced the espionage lifestyle. It was more Hitman than Call of Duty and we’re set for similar antics in Black Ops 6.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Most Wanted, which you've seen in the trailers, that one we do have more of a pick your way of how you want to accomplish this part of the mission”, states Zuk about a mission taking place at a political gala. “There's two distinct parts of the mission where you can choose how you want to play it. And for the replayability factor, certainly more so in the first part, there are multiple ways to accomplish a goal. So we think that players are really going to do one and they're going to talk to their friend and say, ‘I talked to the senator's wife and did A, B and C’, and he's going to be like, ‘Oh, I didn't do that at all. I was trailing this shady character and ended up meeting, accomplishing my goal this other way’. And then that crosstalk gets people interested, well, what did I miss? I should go back and check that out and see what the other path is.”</p><p>“Some of the missions have those options of like, okay, these are the objectives, and then you can kind of get the lay of the land and choose which one you want to tackle first,” Pohorsky confirms. “If you want to go in hot or stealthy, there's options for that too. So it kind of depends on the mission, but I think that's where some of the replayability comes in with the political gala. This time you want to blackmail the senator, or this time you want to hack into a silent auction.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Where possible we try to allow you to play it how you want.</p></div><p>While variety is at the forefront of Black Ops 6’s campaign, so is flexibility and that desire to approach objectives the way you want to. The game may lead you in a certain direction or politely suggest a wise method, but that doesn’t mean you’ll need to listen. Crucially, apart from a couple of occasions, you won’t be punished for doing something ‘the wrong way’. Auto-fail stealth, for example, will be a highly rare occurrence, says Zuk.</p><p>“There are moments where we are very much wanting the player to play stealthily and be careful and quiet, but where possible we try to allow you to play it how you want,” he explains. “And I would say more times than not, you can go loud if that's the way you want to play it. And I can only think of a couple of instances where we sort of don't allow that because it didn't fit with the story. But yeah, I would say in the majority of cases where we have those stealth moments where we're kind of recommending guns down and being more of a spy, certainly we know that people like being action heroes too, so we let that happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“You're still getting all of those blockbuster combat moments for sure”, confirms Pohorski. “I mean that's the bread and butter, but in addition to that, we're layering in these other elements. So yeah, I think I love the more stealthy side. I like going in undercover, so it's been a lot of fun for me to play.”</p><p>That variety is promised across the board and while only a couple of examples have been name-checked here, the plan is that no one mission stands out as being Black Ops 6’s ace in the pack. Instead, Raven has endeavoured to keep the campaign’s chapters consistently engaging and surprising in their setup.</p><p>“We're not banking on any particular mission doing that [stealing the show]”, says Pohorski. “I think what's so great about the variety is that depending on what kind of player you are, there's different missions that you like. And I mean I have personal story elements that I like in certain missions, but then the way that I get to play in another one might be different.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Black Ops 6 is a linear story, so there is not a branching ending for this one.</p></div><p>The Black Ops series is known for its twisting stories, full of memorable characters and globetrotting locations. With an added emphasis on gameplay variety, Black Ops 6 is shaping up to be an exciting possibility. Throw in the different ways to approach these missions and the expectation is that you’ll want to replay certain parts too. </p><p>These gameplay options won’t necessarily have an impact on the story as a whole, though, as the plot itself is locked-in this time around with no multiple or hidden endings to go in search of. “Black Ops 6 is a linear story, so there is not a branching ending for this one”, Zuk states. He also promises a slightly longer campaign than Cold War’s, of which its short length was a main criticism held against it. We’ll find out just how much of Black Ops 6’s campaign lives up to the promise when it arrives on October 25th.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy is loves it when the words "blockbuster" and "spy" are put together.

            <p>Phantom Blade Zero's producer believes authentic cultural themes are important for games and shouldn't be diluted for a global audience.</p>
<p>Liang Qiwei (known as Soulframe), who's also the CEO of developer S-Game, discussed the topic with Japanese site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/709/G070971/20241010065/">4Gamer</a> at this year's Tokyo Game Show (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/phantom-blade-zero-devs-say-cultural-differences-are-not-a-barrier-in-games-but-a-plus-which-is-why-they-dont-tone-down-themes-for-the-west/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>The forthcoming action game has a "kung-fu punk" aesthetic, described as "using kung-fu and martial arts as the core and clothing it in popular culture".</p>

<p>Further, Qiwei suggested that having an obscure theme is part of the appeal for a global audience, comparing the game with Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> that's achieved enormous success.</p>
<p>"If we look at recent titles, Black Myth: Wukong had a much higher hurdle to overcome than our game does in terms of culture as it's completely based on a classic Chinese work of literature," said Qiwei.</p>
<p>"So [Game Science] may encounter this problem of players not understanding the cultural background. But in my opinion, the quality and playing experience of a game are its core. If you can achieve high quality and an entertaining playing experience, I think that a difficult theme can actually be an advantage, not a disadvantage. If your game is entertaining, players will perceive unfamiliar themes as something fresh."</p><p>He continued: "The reason we Chinese players know about Western and Japanese culture is because we had very entertaining Western and Japanese games as an entry point. We gradually became accustomed to them. I doubt Chinese players knew much about Japanese samurai at first, and I don’t think they were especially interested in them. But because there were so many good games about them, they’re now basically recognized as a pop theme.</p>
<p>"So, to repeat, if the game itself is interesting, the sense of its themes being foreign can be an advantage, rather than a barrier. I think it’s a very strong plus that draws in more players."</p>
<p>It's certainly an interesting take, considering one criticism of Black Myth: Wukong was its disjointed storytelling that relied on knowledge of the novel it's based on. Equally, this could have driven renewed interest in the novel, particularly outside of China.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero has been likened to From Software's Dark Souls games, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-has-dark-souls-inspired-non-linear-map-but-developer-still-insists-its-not-a-soulslike">Qiwei insisted the game is not a soulslike</a> despite some influence.</p>
<p>I got to play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">Phantom Blade Zero at Gamescom</a> and adored its tense, parry-driven action.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Star Wars Outlaws will get a Steam release next month, having previously only been available on Ubisoft and Epic's PC storefronts.</p>
<p>Ubisoft shared the news last night, with a social media post saying the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842040/Star_Wars_Outlaws/">available to wishlist now</a>, ahead of a 21st November launch on Valve's platform.</p>

<p>In addition, the company also revealed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> is available to play via Steam now. We knew <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-comes-to-steam-this-month-as-ubisoft-returns-to-valves-storefront">Mirage was poised for the PC storefront sometime this month</a>, however until recently Ubisoft had kept an exact date under wraps.</p>
<p>Last month, Ubisoft announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">new releases are set to launch day one on Steam</a>, starting with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on 14th February next year. This marks a change for the company, which has shunned Steam launch day releases for several years now. </p>
<p>Other Ubisoft games have steadily trickled onto the platform eventually, however. For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-valhalla-headed-to-steam">Assassin's Creed Valhalla and city-building strategy Anno 1800 arrived on the platform back in 2022</a>, having previously been available elsewhere.</p>

<p>We awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars on its initial release in August.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro could be the best place to play multiplatform games with bad PC ports that suffer from a variety of issues, including bad image quality with certain upscalers and stuttering issues.</p>
<p>Speaking during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">latest episode</a> of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the soon-to-be-released mid-generation refresh hardware from Sony, highlighting how the system could be a sort of "nuclear option" to enjoy multiplatform games with bad PC ports thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler which will likely be used over AMD FSR&nbsp; in the vast majority of games, as performance concerns could be the only reason developers may continue to go for AMD's upscaler over the AI-powered one making its debut with the PlayStation 5 Pro in certain scenarios, such as for 120 Hz modes. Considering how games with PSO stutters on PC already tend to run smoother on consoles, playing multiplatform games whose PC ports suffer from this issue on the PlayStation 5 Pro could be the way to go, especially if performance holds up, as it seems more and more like PSSR will be able to deliver great image quality in the vast majority of games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #184: Red Dead PC! Nintendo Mystery Tests, Alien Isolation 2, John vs PS5 Pro!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FenN5sOE1WM?start=2647&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is setting out to be the real game-changer for the PlayStation 5 Pro. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which has a horrible image quality on the base system in Performance Mode, for example, looks great on the system thanks to PSSR, so much so that the usage of the upscaler feels like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-no-vrr-improvements-pssr-lifting-veil/">"lifting a veil of smear."</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide on November 7th.</p>

<p>Deep beneath my desk lies a secret shame: impenetrable black thickets of power leads, sprouting forth across two overlapping extension units. Such a failure of cable management pierces my conscience like the beat of Poe's tell-tale heart, and yet I’m forever powerless – as in, I can’t be bothered – to do anything about it. Yet even I was soothed by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demo for Plug It In, a chilled-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game about clicking chunky plugs into the right outlets.</p>

<p>For the most part, it’s just a case of matching plug shapes to corresponding sockets, and rotating the former so that all of them can fit into the confines of the funkily-shaped outlet arrays. While some cosy tunes play in the background, naturally. The highlights are the puzzles where the plugs include outlets of their own, adding a touch of three-dimensional power stacking that’s satisfying to pull off even when your construction looks like it’s one spark away from incinerating an entire postcode.</p>
<p>It helps that the clean, simple visuals and absolutely <em>delicious</em> click sound when a plug hits home make the whole thing feel like playing with building blocks. Rather than, y'know, the dusty, back-creaking tedium of sorting an extension socket in real life. My only complaint is that it’s not always obvious why a plug will refuse to seat, when there’s seemingly a good match for the connection type and no other plugs blocking its way. This happened to me on a couple of puzzles, which I eventually beat with alternative layouts, but still. What was wrong with the first one?!</p>

<p>Don’t let that put you off too much, though – Plug It In is a lovely, relaxing little puzzler, for neat freaks and embarrassed cable neglecters alike. You can try the demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2757300/PLUG_IT_IN/">on Steam</a>, and there’s a browser version playable on <a href="https://unsame.itch.io/plug-it-in">Itch</a> as well – though the Steam edition looks a fair bit more fleshed-out and polished.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Happy Friday! Once again we’ve made it to the end of the week, and before we relax into the welcoming arms of the weekend, we’re going to have a think about what’s been keeping our controllers busy over the last seven days. I’ve mostly played Metaphor ReFantazio – it’s very good – as well as a spot of Fera: The Sundered Tribes and my usual Overwatch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Sky Oceans Wings for Hire for review, and we’ll find out what he thinks next week. Also he’s been playing Football Manager 24 where he’s had quite an interesting career. He tells us, I started at Man United, got sacked, hired by Nottingham Forest after they were relegated from the Premier League and got them back into the Prem in my first season, and then they performed poorly so I left before getting sacked. Now close to being at Valencia for 2 years. In my first year I got them into the Europa Conference league, 2 years ahead of the Board’s schedule, and this season I’m challenging for the Champions League. I have a 30-year-old Dominic Calvert Lewin to thank for that who is a goal machine, and I bet Tottenham regret letting me nab him for free!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile,<strong> Nic B</strong> played what he’s called IndiUncharted Wars: A New Franchise. By which I think he means Unknown 9: Awakening. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/unknown-9-awakening-review/">You can find out what he thinks right now</a>! <strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Neva for review, the new game from the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/13/gris-review/">Gris</a>, and a bit more Skull and Bones and Mario Odyssey – what a wild crossover!</p>
<p><strong>Nick P’s</strong> week has been dominated by the excellent Silent Hill 2 and a bit of Vision of Mana, while <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Diablo IV latest expansion and season, as well as Vendetta Forever for review, <em>and</em> Sonic x Shadow Generations. Also, he tried Two Point Academy last night because he’s wanted to play it for ages and it went onto PS+ on Tuesday. He says it’s good!</p>

<p>In real-world gaming he also made a level 5 Elf Blood Hunter who can turn into a hybrid werewolf for Halloween D&amp;D, telling us, “I’m quite excited about that!”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> has hit the point of no return in Cyberpunk 2077 and, rather predictably, he’s used this as a signal to go and do a load of side quests instead of barrelling down the golden path. He’s also been playing New World: Aeternum, Amazon’s MMO relaunch which is out now on PC and consoles. He says, “Obviously, it’s changed a lot since I dipped my toes in the beta version several years ago with a ton of new and refined features. I’m currently playing as a Mystic (healers will forever be my go-to class in MMOs) and I’m enjoying my time in the starting area.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished up with the superb Silent Hill 2 (he will be going back for replays soon) and immediately followed it up with a batch of Halloween spooky demos in the Steam Next Fest. It’s not all scary stuff though, as he says, “To balance the frights and fears I’ve been playing the fun Nikoderiko – a very Crash Bandicoot-influenced platformer that first came to my attention through YouTube ads of all things. Finally I started the lovely Snufkin game on Switch and look forward to some cozy evenings spent with the Moomins and a warm mug of cocoa over the winter months”.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> week has consisted of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/arizona-sunshine-remake-review/">Arizona Sunshine Remake</a>, Destiny 2, and Diablo IV which he’s unfortunately finding rather boring. Oh well, back to Destiny 2 then?</p>
<p>He was joined in Arizona Sunshine Remake by <strong>Tef</strong>, who also visited the original game to see just how much has changed – spoilers: <a href="https://youtu.be/gM9UPrBeUkI">a hell of a lot</a>! He also wrapped up our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and got to spend some time with a little indie [<em>sic</em>] game that you’ll hear about in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-1-02-performance-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy XVI PC update went live a few hours ago, introducing new graphics settings, enhanced performance and several other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 1.02 update introduces, besides a cursor lock option and improved help text for Photo Mode, and improvements for Shadow Quality settings, which now include cloud quality at all three levels instead of leaving the cloud quality always at high. This should bring performance improvements when selecting medium or low. Graphical Fidelity settings have also been changed to improve overall performance.</p>
<p>The new Final Fantasy XVI update also introduces fixes for aspect ratios other than 16:9, graphics not displaying correctly in certain scenarios, crashing issues on select hardware configurations, and more. The full update notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/4545912721046242416?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review of last year's PS5 release.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gone-home-studio-fullbright-are-now-making-games-about-horrible-toilet-spiders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
You probably still know Fullbright as the studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, a delicately experimental first-person yarn about a girl exploring her family home after travelling overseas, and learning about the turmoil in her absence. Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3098700/Fullbright_Presents_TOILET_SPIDERS/">Steam</a>, Toilet Spiders is the first in a new anthology series of "short, strange, lo-fi games", gathered under the label Fullbright Presents. To crib unceremoniously from the Steam blurb, it's "a short, replayable lo-fi first-person survival horror game where you must learn to judge your odds and manage your resources to avoid or scare off the giant radioactive spiders laying in wait inside filthy toilets that contain the keys and items you need to complete your mission and escape with your life." 
</p>
<p>
The game takes place in some kind of Exclusion Zone, with you playing a nameless "volunteer" sent by an evidently tyrannous regime, and the map is broken into several floors. "Scavenged items like old light bulbs, surplus flash grenades, and lucky coins will aid you on your mission, but their numbers are precious few," the Steam page continues. "You must learn how best to weigh your odds and make your own luck if you want to live."</p>
<p>Personally, I think the game has missed a trick by not including some kind of pooping mechanic, because as every arachnophobe knows, the real terror of the hypothetical toilet spider is realising you forgot to check the bowl before plonking yourself down. Mind you, you can always increase the intensity by downloading on Steam Deck and playing it while riding the porcelain express.
</p><p>
Fullbright's games have always contained the suggestion of horror, of course. Gone Home plays with your expectations a bit, dangling the red herring of supernatural activity only to swap it for the, er, emerald pilchard of it all being a metaphor for closeted emotions. Fullbright's subsequent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a> makes that more overt, being set aboard a space station haunted by holograms. Still, I'm impressed at the speed with which Fullbright have transited from "psychological motif" to "literal atomic arachnid gnawing my face off". Could the giant spiders be a metaphor for something as well? I wouldn't be surprised if the game's B-movie stylings were another red herring.
</p>
<p>
The less-fun context for all this is that Fullbright aren't the same Fullbright who made Gone Home or Tacoma. Back in 2021, co-founder Steve Gaynor was accused of mistreating staff and creating a toxic workplace by several former employees. Gaynor subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gone-home-studio-co-founder-steps-down-following-allegations-of-toxic-workplace-culture">stepped back from his role</a> on the company's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/open-roads-review">"short but bittersweet"</a> fable Open Roads, and parted ways with the development team, who became a separate entity.</p>
<p>As of September 2023, Gaynor was Fullbright's sole remaining employee. I think Toilet Spiders is mostly his work. It is... dangerously easy to read Toilet Spiders as some kind of commentary on the events above, and on Gaynor's state of mind since. Don't let that stop you, though.
