            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that it currently doesn't have any plans to release a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>PS5 Pro patch, so if you were hoping the game was about to get cyber-augmented for Sony's beefy new machine, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, CDPR crushes the dreams of anyone who was hoping for a PS5 Pro-enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>in just nine words (or ten if you consider "PS5" two words): "we currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch".</p>

<p>Of course, CD Projekt Red is fully entitled to do whatever it likes with its games, but the lack of a PS5 Pro patch for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>feels a touch disappointing given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-opencritic-page-will-warn-players-about-technical-issues" rel="nofollow">history of technical issues</a> (although those issues admittedly weren't anywhere near as bad in the PS5 version).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=nRZbaz4E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=sME3GoAc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>isn't getting a PS5 Pro patch anytime soon, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>CD Projekt Red also hasn't said anything about its seminal action-RPG&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&nbsp;</em>getting any kind of PS5 Pro patch, so whichever of the studio's two biggest RPGs you're into, you're out of luck if you're a PS5 Pro owner.</p>

<p>It's likely that production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-team-relocating-to-boston" rel="nofollow">sequel</a> is taking precedence over further major changes to the original game. Last we heard, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-sold-43-million-copies-as-dev-team-for-sequel-is-being" rel="nofollow">development team for said sequel was being assembled</a>, although naturally, we don't know what the game will be called or when it will launch yet.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>won't be enhanced for the PS5 Pro, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">host of other games</a> do have enhancements for Sony's new console. Titles like&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, and the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>all have extra visual or performance features on Sony's new console.</p>

            <p>One of my proudest pictures of a 2018 trip to Croatia wasn't of me and my pal. No, it wasn't of the beautiful scenery or the glistening sea either. It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn't seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume <em>together</em> in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there's a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neko-odyssey">Neko Odyssey</a> on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It's nice!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Neko Odyssey goes for a familiar nostalgic Japanese game look, employing a 2D pixellated style overlaid on a 3D backdrop. It really captures the heart, what with pleasant boppy music and an authentic-seeming town in the demo. Solid vending machine work. Good ramen restaurant layout. Strong abundance of cats.</p>
<p>Cats that you'll want to take photos of, largely by walking up to them and pressing the space bar. The aim? To grow your Insta following for an audience who demands more cat pics, with those likes viewable at the press of a button and a quick doomscroll of your feed.</p>
<p>One of my favourite pics was of a cat whose face was wedged in a crack in a wall.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/neko-odyssey2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Flyhigh Works</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And I like this one of a cat who was sat opposite his owner in a ramen restaurant, clearly annoyed at his lack of a portion.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/neko-odyssey1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Flyhigh Works</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some cats aren't that easy to take photos of, though. Some demand cat food, while others are perched in hard-to-reach places you'll need to figure out a route towards. According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2476350/Neko_Odyssey/">Steam page</a>, there's also a "storyline where you'll unravel the mysteries of the town based on the information you capture in your cat photos". I can't say mine have much truth to them.</p>
<p>No, I won't pretend that Neko Odyssey is going to be the next big thing. But <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2476350/Neko_Odyssey/">the demo</a> is pleasant enough for a quick jaunt and a quick hit of the dopamine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Shadow Of Chornobyl is out today. As you may have read, it's on the buggy side. Buggier than a bucketful of locusts. Buggier than Kafka's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a>. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Shadow Of Chornobyl review</a>, wasteland wanderer James called it "easily the most borked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> I've played in years", detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly. 
</p>
<p>
James didn't encounter any outright game-breaking bugs, and as he noted, a bit of technical scruffiness is to be expected from developers who are weathering the real-life invasion of their country. Still, it's good to hear that GSC Game World have already addressed a number of issues in "the last few days", and there are of course patches on the way.
</p>
<p>
In an email today, GSC Game World claimed that they'd fixed 1125 individual issues since dispatching the review code, ranging from crashing problems to full-on progress blockers. 
</p>
<p>
Some highlights from the changelog: they've quashed a softlock dialogue issue that left you unable to leave one conversation, a problem with missing weapon sound effects, and a glitch that made dead bodies behave in unsightly ways, such as striking A-poses. They've also stopped the game spawning quest scenarios right under the player's nose, and nixed an issue whereby players would accidentally change their reputation with one NPC faction.
</p><p>
As for cosmetic enhancements, GSC Game World say they've cleaned up the UI and animations during dialogue and tweaked the lighting. They've also addressed some performance issues, including a freezing problem during busier cutscenes or when exploring crowded areas, while working to improve the overall frame rate and loading times.
</p>
<p>
Going by James's review and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 reviews in general, all this is just scratching the surface. GSC Game World sending us a list of things they've already fixed right before the embargo lift feels a bit cheeky - they're trying to head off criticism at the pass. But I can't blame them for wanting players to get a sense of the game's current status as it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">lands on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few wasteland gremlins GSC Game World hope to corner and slaughter in the first few patches - there's one coming "shortly after release", to be followed by a series of hotfixes.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Just Like the Good Old Days: Emitter in Faust's Cell is indistinguishable from regular mesh and surroundings making it difficult for the player to notice important quest item while progressing through" quest.
</p>
<p>
- The Freedom Colosseum: Player unable to take a part in the fourth round on the arena despite having all preconditions met 
</p>
<p>
- Game Settings &amp; Controls: Keybinding for flashlight activation can not be changed upon entering keyboard settings
</p>
<p>
- Title stability: On some rare occasions title may close unexpectedly right after choosing difficulty setting
</p>
<p>
- Memory Leak caused issues with facials: a memory leak and a visual bug that occurred when the tick of montage instances was disabled while the Face was not rendered.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I personally enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hello-rockstar-please-make-an-open-world-based-on-my-unplayable-xbox-edition-of-red-dead-redemption">roving around in very buggy gameworlds</a>, especially post-apocalyptic landscapes that are subject to reality distortions, where the dipping of the frame rate and the deranging of the textures just feels like scene-setting. But that comes with the important caveat that I am generally being paid to play them. Thankfully, Shadow Of Chornobyl appears to be an engrossing shooter for all its programming warts and bunions. Here's a closing excerpt from James's review. 
</p><p>
"I've been battered and sometimes frustrated by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, but ultimately there is something admirable about its commitment to challenging you - especially when it simultaneously provides just enough tools to avoid becoming unfair. Between that, its punchy shooting, and some properly superb atmosphere-building, it's done enough to earn the mantle of Good Game."

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s upcoming permanent OG Mode will have its own unique battle pass, developer Epic Games has revealed, separate to that of the game's main Fortnite Battle Royale offering.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously revealed that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">hugely-popular original Fortnite map would return permanently in December</a> as a separate mode that looks set to rotate through its various seasonal incarnations. The decision follows the map's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">massive but temporary return 12 months ago</a> that gave the game its best-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december">blog post</a> today, Epic Games revealed that the new OG Pass, as well as the game's main Battle Pass, plus the next iterations of the Music Pass and Lego Pass (each 1400 V-Bucks) will all be included in the existing Fortnite Crew subscription going forward. 
</p>
<p>
That's a big upgrade for anyone currently paying £10/$12 a month for Fortnite Crew. The changes mean that this subscription will soon include four battle passes for the same price, instead of just the main Battle Pass.
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of other tweaks today, too. The cost of the main Fortnite Battle Pass is being rounded up to 1000 V-Bucks instead of 950, and new Crew subscribers after 1st December will only be able to claim battle pass rewards while their subscription is active.
</p>
<p>
More details on exactly what will be in the new OG Pass and how much it will cost are still to come ahead of the mode's arrival on 6th December.
</p>
<p>At the same time, Fortnite will also offer an all new Chapter 6 version of its evergreen battle royale, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-map-features-japanese-theme-leaks-suggest">which looks set to have a Japanese theme</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Almost a decade after the game’s original release, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</a> has been patched on modern consoles with a significant performance update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin’s Creed Syndicate TV spot Trailer [EUROPE]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HT5Ws-RDUI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> has confirmed that the underrated, Victorian era stealth ’em up now runs at a silky smooth 60 frame per second on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. There’s also the option to simultaneously crank the game’s resolution to 4K though this won’t be available to those playing on the slightly less robust Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>The publisher didn’t give a specific reason for Syndicate’s mini makeover, nor has it hinted at similar updates for other popular AC titles including the Ezio Collection, Unity, and Black Flag. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february/">With Assassins’ Creed Shadows pushed back to February 2025,</a> it likely wanted to drum up interest in older entries with many players having overlooked Syndicate.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate launched in October 2015 and although it was met with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review/">generally positive reviews</a>, fans had become overfamiliar with the franchise’s time-hopping, open world formula even if introduced dual protagonists and a genuinely interesting setting. This would be the final instalment before Ubisoft hit the reset button, transporting players back to Ancient Egypt in 2017’s Assassin’s Creed: Origins. Its debut drew a line in the sand and would serve as the foundation for future titles, treading further and further into action RPG territory.</p>

<p>Last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage went against the grain with a smaller, more focused adventure that dialled back many of those roleplaying systems. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/assassins-creed-mirage-review/">our review</a> we scored it a fair 7/10, Aran saying: “Assassin’s Creed Mirage will appeal to anyone who’s been pining for a return to the old school open world stealth of the earlier games. It’s pretty much exactly that with a few extra refinements and additions. Some of those additions are a bit distracting and immersion breaking, but nothing gets in the way of some good old fashioned assassinations.”</p>

			<p>A <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1859251588688162930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1859251588688162930%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge change to the microtransactions</a> is coming in Fortnite, meaning that you can get a ton of content for a fixed price each month. As of <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/">December 1</a>, Fortnite Crew will give you access to all of the following for no additional cost as long as you are an active subscriber:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battle Pass</li>
<li>Music Pass</li>
<li>Lego Pass</li>
<li>Any other new Pass that arrives</li>
<li>1,000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Monthly Crew Pack</li>
<li>Crew Pack legacy styles</li>
<li>Rocket Pass Premium</li>
</ul>
<p>To get all of this content and the premium tracks of each pass, you simply have to pay $11.99 a month. This is a huge change from what it was previously, where you'd have to pay for each pass separately. It hasn't been stated why this change has been made, but there is already a lot of positive buzz around it on social media. Of course, since this means that players will have to pay substantially less to be able to access all of the rewards available, players are beginning to wonder what the catch is. Why would a huge company be favorable towards the players?</p>
<p>So far, it seems that you have to consistently be subscribed to Fortnite Crew to be able to get the rewards, whereas previously, players found that they could pay for Fortnite Crew every other month to get rewards at half the price. However, the rules have been updated to stop Fortnite players from doing that.</p>
<p>It's been stated that for new subscribers to Fortnite Crew, premium rewards on the Battle Pass will only be available to claim if your Fortnite Crew subscription is active. This means that if you cancel it halfway through the pass duration, you won't be able to claim any of the Premium rewards. Instead, you'll now only be able to claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of your current billing period rather than the remaining duration of the pass.</p>
<p>However, for players who are currently subscribed to Fortnite Crew or subscribe before December 1, there will be no changes made to you can claim premium rewards on the Battle Pass. However, should you cancel your Fortnite Crew subscription after December 1 and then resubscribe after your previous subscription has expired, you'll then be considered a new subscriber and will be in line with the new rules for the pass system.</p>
<p>To get any premium rewards on the Music Pass and Lego Pass, an active Fortnite Crew subscription will be needed to get access to the premium tracks. This will also apply to any new battle passes that are added in the future.</p>

<p>Unknown 9: Awakening Developer Reflector Entertainment has announced that it is reducing the studio’s total workforce by 18%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developer of Unknown 9: Awakening announced on its <a href="https://reflectorentertainment.com/en/news/message-to-the-reflector-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unknown-9-developer-reflector-entertainment-reportedly-suffers-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>) that it is shifting its focus as it enters a new phase of development. These changes aim to help the studio deliver on its objectives more efficiently and ensure that each team member can contribute meaningfully to ongoing projects. As a result, 18% of the workforce has been laid off.</p>



<p>Reflector Entertainment has announced that this decision is due to their “current reality,” which prevents them from guaranteeing “tangible work” for all employees. The studio will offer severance packages and access to medical support, emotional assistance, and career planning resources to ensure a smooth transition for those affected.</p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have stated that this decision will allow them “to take the necessary time” to refine and perfect their upcoming projects. The studio has released Unknown 9: Awakening and has two key production lines entering the early stages of development. They require their staff to be “laser-focused on contributing to the projects that wholly benefit from their skillsets.”</p>

It will also allegedly have symmetrical sticks.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/07/24/valve-steam-controller-redesign8000cinema12800jpg-8dd5b8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Valve's Steam controller.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Lynch said Valve seems to be working on a new VR controller also for mass production, codenamed "Roy." Roy is apparently referenced in Valve's SteamVR code, and would supposedly be a wand-shaped companion to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor">rumored wireless "Deckard" headset</a> that's also reportedly in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roy would reportedly double as a Steam Controller gamepad when not being used with VR, including a D-pad, shoulder buttons, and a set of ABXY buttons for more traditional gameplay in addition to its motion and VR functionality.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Valve Roy controller(s) have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap</p><p>I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named</p><p>There is also an unreleased OpenXR extension for these controllers <a href="https://t.co/36WBtLvYZ5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/36WBtLvYZ5</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While it's unclear when either of these products will be in our hands, Lynch alluded in one post that it's unlikely Deckard specifically is a holiday 2024 release. The headset has allegedly been in the works for some time and was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor">first reported on in 2021</a>. Though Valve already released one VR headset in 2019, the Index, it requires multiple base station sensors and connection to a PC. Deckard allegedly would be standalone, more akin to a Meta Quest headset, making it a more accessible (and theoretically more affordable) option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Steam Controller 2, while we're still short on details, fans are hopeful its control scheme and customizability will be reminiscent of the Steam Deck handheld, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-review">got a fancier OLED model just last year</a>. IGN has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>. One of the three patents in question is about riding on top of Pokémon (Palworld also lets players ride Pals).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo reportedly moved quickly to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-may-have-reinforced-patents-specifically-to-target-palworlds-game-mechanics-expert-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reinforce its existing patents by fast-tracking divisional applications</u></a> (new child patents of bigger, parent patents) specifically for use in its Japan-based litigation against Pocketpair, taking its first action soon after Palworld launched in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now one patent expert has suggested a GTA 5 mod dating back to 2016 may be recognized as a precedent by the court, and that’s because it included the catching Pokémon mechanic long before Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-patent-lawsuit-could-be-tipped-in-palworlds-favor-by-a-gta5-mod-from-8-years-ago-japanese-attorney-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> reported, <a href="https://business.nikkei.com/atcl/seminar/19/00030/111400614/?n_cid=nbponb_twbn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikkei Business Online Edition</a> quoted Ryo Arashida, representative patent attorney from the Japan-based Patent Attorney Corporation Siarasia, as saying that while the outcome of the lawsuit is unclear, this GTA 5 mod could work in Palworld’s favor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod in question is likely LudicrousBeach’s <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/pokemon-go-gta-edition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Go GTA Edition mod</a>, which adds the mechanic of throwing a Poke Ball at Pokémon to capture them in Rockstar’s GTA 5. The mod was inspired by and launched just a month after Niantic’s massively popular Pokémon Go mobile game in August 2016.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/screenshot-2024-11-20-134754-1732110487310.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">LudicrousBeach’s Pokémon Go GTA Edition mod.

The parent patent that Patent No. 7545191 belongs to was registered in December 2021, which means this GTA 5 mod also pre-dates that. Arashida said “there is a possibility that the GTA5 Pokémon mod will be recognized as a precedent by the court.” If so, Patent No. 7545191 could be deemed invalid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all speculation at this point of course, but it seems likely Pocketpair will be looking for all the help it can get as it prepares its defense.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/screenshot-2024-11-08-113522-1731065735516-1732110684886.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Patent No. 7545191.

			<p>If you've been looking at the upcoming MOBA Battle Royale Supervive, then you're in luck. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283700/SUPERVIVE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Open Beta</a> for SUPERVIVE has just kicked off today and is shaping up to be the next "10,000-hour" game in the multiplayer scene that is hoping to take the scene by storm. This title comes from industry veterans from Riot, Blizzard, Respawn, and Bungie, who have plenty of experience in the multiplayer scene. SUPERVIVE was first playable during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-5-games-you-should-try-during-this-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a> and was a huge success, with the game being downloaded by over 15,000 players within 24 hours, with new players averaging at least 20 games of SUPERVIVE. To celebrate the release of the Open Beta for SUPERVIVE, a launch trailer has been released to showcase the features of the game and what you can expect from your time in SUPERVIVE. If you are curious, check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="SUPERVIVE | Open Beta Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auV1HOQi360?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who want to get stuck into SUPERVIVE's Open Beta, it will be available for players in North America, Europe, Asia, South America (Sao Paulo), and Korea via NEXON. Here, you can experience open-ended abilities from a hero shooter, with unique physics-based combat similar to Smash Bros, with a third combination of team-driven objectives similar to those you would see in a MOBA. Putting all of these elements together creates an action sandbox for people to get stuck into and sink plenty of time in.</p>
<p>Since Steam Next Fest, the Evolving Equipment system has been overhauled, with 24 new evolutions and unique traits to choose from and experiment with. Hunters now have Level 3 ability upgrades, which allow players to create a more customized playstyle. For those who may feel a little overwhelmed by what's going on in front of them, players will be able to pre-select starting loadouts, which can help them get acquainted with SUPERVIVE and how it all functions.</p>
<p>SUPERVIVE has multiple game modes to choose from, with the option to play in 4-player squads, 10-team battle royals, 2-player duos, and 4v4 deathmatches. In total, there are 16 unique hunters to choose from, each with their own abilities that make them special. All of the hunters are unlocked through spending time playing SUPERVIVE, meaning no money will have to be spent.</p>
<p>There are also new dynamic map features, such as Meteor Bosses, randomized hot zones that have high-tier loot that you can fight over, and new storm shifts that reshape the battlefield around you.</p>
<p>Will you be playing SUPERVIVE?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc-release-confirmed.1040721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spike Chunsoft has announced that roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island</em>, which proved pretty popular on Switch, is officially heading to PC via Steam.</p>

<p>In a press release, the company reveals that&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the fastest-selling game in the&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>series, having surpassed 200,000 copies shipped in Japan "quickly" following its launch in January.</p>

<p>That sales performance is probably why Spike Chunsoft has decided to release this one on Steam as well, although we don't know when the game is arriving on the platform, unfortunately; the Steam page simply reads "coming soon" under the release date heading.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=8g0-XUCD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=FMrBh5EE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is officially coming to Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As the press release points out,&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game to make its way to the West since 2016's <i>The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate</i>, which also came to Switch in 2020.</p>

<p>In fact, that game itself was originally released in 2010 for the DS before getting a PlayStation Vita port in 2015, which was subsequently released in the West the following year.</p>

<p>In the years between 2010 and this year, only one&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game was released: 2013's&nbsp;<em>Princess Suzune and the Tower of Slumber</em>, which was...a pachinko game. Hardly counts as a&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>release, if you ask me.</p>

<p>That means that technically,&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first full game in the series for a staggering 14 years.</p>




<p><em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>introduces some new elements to&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer</em>, including 3D visuals, creating "a fresh and exciting adventure", as Spike Chunsoft puts it.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the basic structure of the game, it's a roguelike RPG in which you must explore a series of dungeons filled with monsters, traps, and items to collect. Dying during exploration will mean losing everything you've collected, so this is very much not one for the faint of heart.</p>

<p><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is available <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Switch</a> and is launching for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in the future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Square Enix’s hit MMO revealed a mobile version this week that has the potential to bring millions of new players into the rich RPG  world of Hydaelyn. It also raises a lot of questions about just how exactly a mobile version of the subscription-based multiplayer game will work. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The port is being developed by Tencent-owned Lightspeed Studios and will be focused on the standard version of <em>FFXIV</em> called <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, which first launched back in 2013 as a complete 2.0 overhaul of the base game. The game doesn’t have a release date yet, but when it arrives it will feature nine job classes, and activities like fishing, Chocobo racing, and the Triple Triad card game. </p><p>“This is our latest MMORPG title specifically tailored for the mobile platform Despite these adjustments, Lightspeed Studios is working with tremendous enthusiasm and dedication to faithfully recreate the story, duties, battle content and other aspects of the original game,” director Naoki Yoshida said in a new trailer announcing the project. </p><p>Lightspeed Studios also developed the mobile version of <em>PUBG</em> which is full of microtransactions, and Square Enix’s other mobile games are also packed with stamina meters and gacha mechanics. Will a mobile version of <em>FFXIV</em> be free-to-play with cooldown mechanics and new in-game currencies? Will there be a standard monthly subscription fee players can pay to just enjoy the game as they would have otherwise be able to do on console? Will there be any cross-over between the two versions, with existing expansions like <em>Heavensward</em> and <em>Stormblood</em> arriving every year?</p><p>The current announcement is a neat surprise but light on details, perhaps because Lightspeed and Square Enix aren’t yet sure exactly how all of those things will work, either. One thing that’s clear is that<em> FFXIV</em> on smartphones is meant to be a casual way to onboard new players into the MMO’s world. “You can experience the game in your own way, whether solo or alongside other players,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new website</a></span> for the mobile port reads. “Beginners and mentors, party members, and even adventurers you meet by chance can become your friends.”</p><p>For now, <em>FFXIV </em>is easy enough to play on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741">A free trial mode</a></span> lets you experience much of the game before needing to pay anything. And who knows, maybe this upcoming mobile port will be a way for Square Enix to bring the MMORPG to Switch 2 later down the road. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix doesn't sound like it will slow down the HD-2D remake treatment going forward. Though nothing is official, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka offered up his preference for the team's next project: Final Fantasy VI.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-quest-3-remake-interview-hd-2d-final-fantasy-vi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>, Hayasaka was asked what could be next from Square Enix after remaking Dragon Quest III and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/live-a-live-review-live-laugh-love-live-a-live/1900-6417919/" data-ref-id="1900-6417919">Live A Live</a> before that. "It's not that we have concrete plans for this, but personally I would have to say Final Fantasy VI," said the producer. "Octopath Traveler--the first HD-2D title--was developed while referencing [Final Fantasy VI], as it had the highest-quality pixel art. I would love to see how the game we referenced would look with the HD-2D art style."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="228293556" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has announced that a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> demo will be available to download on November 22nd for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>The free demo will give players their first taste of the reimagined hack and slash series as they take on the role of nameless warrior whose fate in entwined with that of ancient China’s warring Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set during a campaign against the tyrannical Dong Zhuo, players will find themselves thrust into the Battle of Sishui Gate. For those who have been following Dynasty Warriors: Origins since its announcement, this is the same stage that has been shown off during various expos, showcasing many of the game fresh new features as well as some of its most beloved characters. Speaking of which, the Battle of Sishui Gate is where the allied Three Kingdoms first face off against the legendary warrior, Lu Bu, a fight that’s bound to put players through their paces once the training wheels come off.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will officially launch next year on January 17th, making it one of 2025’s first major releases with pre-orders now live across all available platforms. It’s a soft reset for the series, and while it doesn’t look to be a complete departure from previous games there are some interesting mechanics at play that will hopefully dispel the bad taste left by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-9">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>.</p>

<p>It has been the best part of a decade since the last numbered instalment which scored a mediocre 5/10 in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9 review</a>. We concluded that” Sadly, this isn’t the breakthrough fans were expecting. Omega Force took a pretty big risk with Dynasty Warriors 9, and while its open world integration can be seen as a small triumph, this newest entry is marred by its heavily outdated approach to combat design.”</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to attend a preview event for Origins and will have some first hands-on impressions coming very soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-server-issues.1040679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>is being hit with extremely negative reviews on Steam after seemingly launching with extensive server issues, with users pointing to server loops, excessive loading times, and login queues as major issues, as well as problems with the game's cloud asset infrastructure.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Microsoft and developer Asobo Studio released the latest iteration of the&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>franchise, but it's already run into major issues, accruing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a> across 2,955 reviews (at time of writing).</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues users seem to be pointing out has to do with how&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>loads its assets. Much of the game's asset loading, including for aircraft, liveries, and more, is tied to cloud streaming, and since servers are struggling, that seems to be leading to problems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=m2O1_FPO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=xUBK3pyC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>players are not happy with how the game has been released.</figcaption></figure><p>One player says they were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199244305024/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stuck on a loading screen "for 65 minutes"</a>, with the screen freezing up at 97% and seemingly refusing to load any further than that.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198192847703/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out some of the aforementioned issues</a>&nbsp;and says&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>"feels like an alpha build", concluding that it "looks pretty and has potential but needs a lot of work". That's particularly damning for a game with a hefty asking price of $69.99.</p>

<p>The game's developers have said they are aware of the issue, dedicating a developer livestream to the problem earlier today.&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>head Jorg Neumann said the team had "completely underestimated how high" pre-release excitement had been for the game.</p>

<p>Asobo Studio CEO Sebastian Wloch offers a technical explanation for the issues; players are asking&nbsp;<em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers for data, which is then cached in a database, but said cache is "currently getting saturated".</p>




<p>Wloch says the team stress-tested&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers during the game's tech alpha, with the team performing load tests "simulating 200,000 users", but he concedes that the game has been "completely overwhelmed".</p>

<p>Community manager Jayne, also known as Jummivana, pledges to keep players updated via social media, and Neumann concludes the stream by apologizing to affected players, acknowledging that many are "frustrated" with the game's issues.</p>

<p>He says that although he knows the development team "had some problems today", the devs are "on it" and attempting to fix&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s issues. Unfortunately, though, for now, if you're stuck, it looks like there's no fix yet.</p>

<p>If you want to try your luck, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, as well as Xbox Series X|S. The game is also part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games" rel="nofollow">November's Xbox Game Pass lineup</a>&nbsp;for PC Game Pass or Ultimate members.</p>

<p>Square Enix and Lightspeed Studios have just announced Final Fantasy 14 Mobile, an adaptation of the popular online MMORPG for Android and iOS devices.&nbsp;The game will first be released as a demo through multiple playtests in China and then launched globally. Interested players can pre-register on the game’s <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile will serve as an extension of the popular franchise and a sister game to FFXIV. The developers have confirmed their goal of recreating the “grandeur of the original’s story and combat mechanics on mobile devices”. Players can also expect a faithful implementation of non-combat features, such as the “Disciples of the Land and Hand”.</p>



<p>Existing franchise fans can look forward to a fresh interpretation of the familiar journey presented in a new format. New players will also have the opportunity to experience the beautiful and vibrant world of Eorzea for the first time.</p>



<p>Regarding features, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will retain lifestyle content such as fishing, Triple Triad, and Chocobo racing. When it comes to exploration, the world of Eorzea features intricate weather and time-of-day systems that offer over 600 different weather patterns across various landscapes. In terms of customization, player characters and equipment designs have been carefully crafted and optimized to bring the original game’s details to life.</p>

The new Star Wars game has been discounted in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024-when-will-the-sale-start-this-year">Black Friday sales</a>, now down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvVeL?object_uuid=f691f518-3b61-47e9-b5e3-5fb07e34874f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.99 on PS5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3l0n?object_uuid=f691f518-3b61-47e9-b5e3-5fb07e34874f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>. That's $20 off the original list price and potentially a much better offering for anyone unsure of the game when it launched back in late August. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal also features Amazon's exclusive limited edition content pack, which includes Rogue Infiltrator cosmetics for Kay and Nix. It's likely the best deal we're getting on the game before Christmas, so snap it up if you've been waiting for a sale, or want to gift it to someone over the holidays.</p><div id="208147" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (PS5)</h3></p></div><div catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f" id="208149"><div id="208149" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (Xbox)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This could be a good time to jump on the game since it's not been long since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-12-starts-road-to-recovery-with-improved-performance-and-large-number-of-fixes">Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment deployed a massive update</a> bringing a host of performance and gameplay enhancements, a range of visual improvements, and bug fixes to the open-world sci-fi game on console and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher laid out everything new in the patch notes <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on its website</u></a>, with Ubisoft emphasizing that these updates were shaped by player feedback, reaffirming its commitment to closely listening as post-launch support for Star Wars Outlaws continues.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What We Said In Our Review</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">IGN reviewer Tristan Ogilvie said is his review</a>: "It’s ironic that Kay’s ship is called the Trailblazer, since there’s actually not a whole lot of ideas in Star Wars Outlaws that haven’t been done before in other action and open-world adventures. Instead, it’s quite like the Millenium Falcon: a bucket of bolts held together with repurposed parts and prone to breaking down, but at its best it’s more than capable of jolting your pleasure centres into Star Wars fan hyperspace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A clever syndicate system brings real weight to almost every task you choose to undertake, some of which have creative quest designs that can often conjure up some genuinely stunning blindsides. Having a pal like Nix at your side the entire time not only adds an extra dimension to Kay’s fairly generic smuggler character, but also gives her an enhanced set of useful abilities. But even he can’t quite make its stealth and combat feel any less rigid and repetitive, and the odds of avoiding the many glaring technical issues present at launch are 3,720 to one. But you probably didn’t want me to tell you the odds."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals have already kicked off. Leading up to the big event, retailers have begun to open deals online. Each day leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance, such as this new discount on Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

"In this sense, personally, I’d like to try to make a new Dragon Engine specialized for high-spec consoles, and with it, to develop a new action-adventure game. This is just what I personally feel, so it has nothing to do with the studio’s actual plans."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito obviously has some influence as technical director of RGG Studio but it's unclear if fans' hopes for an upgraded engine will emerge anytime soon. The Dragon Engine has so far been used to create Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Yakuza Kiwami 2, First of the North Star: Lost Paradise, Judgement, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio is known for its prompt releases, and this list is somehow just a fraction of its overall output as in the same time it's also released Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 Remastered, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD, Judgement Remastered, Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania, and Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But releasing so many games has some drawbacks, as while each Yakuza game has reviewed well, fans have complained about animations and assets that get reused over multiple entries. It's for reasons such as these that fans are eager for a new engine, not to mention the technological leap that would potentially come with leaving the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito added to this somewhat, saying that while RGG Studio has found ways to squeeze more life out of the Dragon Engine with each entry, it's also being held back by keeping its games on the previous console generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We would like to avoid limiting ourselves because of performance as much as possible, but not everyone plays the Like a Dragon series on higher-end consoles, so we would like to figure out a future plan on this at some point," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This again stops short of confirming a new engine being in development at RGG Studio, and as mentioned it's already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/majima-focused-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-at-rgg-summit-as-next-yakuza-game">revealed its next game as Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> as another Dragon Engine entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just a spin-off, however, leaving fans with a little hope that the next mainline game, Like a Dragon 9, will perhaps make that technological jump. RGG Studio head <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-dragon-engine-unreal-engine-5-masayoshi-yokoyama">Masayoshi Yokoyama even said in 2022 that the Dragon Engine is "a bit old."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Even those who do manage to load into the game are having problems, with players reporting missing content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/kuMd7udCyFM?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video message to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s disgruntled community</a>, Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Sebastian Wloch, Asobo CEO and co-founder, explained why the launch had gone so badly wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neumann began the video with an admission: “We knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly we completely underestimated how high and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Frankly we completely underestimated how high [excitement was] and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wloch then proceeded to go into more detail, revealing that even simulating 200,000 concurrent players during pre-release load tests failed to prevent the launch from causing catastrophic server problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've been struggling for a few hours with one of our services,” Wloch explained. “In Flight Sim 2024, there are a few new systems in the sim. People have noticed in the career mode there's all sorts of missions, and when players at the very beginning when they start, they're asking a server for some data, and that server is going to cache it in a database. It's a pretty big database and there is a cache, and that cache is currently getting saturated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a cache that has been thoroughly tested during the whole Tech Alpha. We've done load tests simulating 200,000 users, and tonight it's just completely overwhelmed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asobo's initial attempt to fix the problems showed promise, but eventually buckled as this cache collapsed once again. “We've tried to restart the services,” Wloch said. “We've taken measures to throttle the number of people who can come in at the same time. At some point it worked pretty well, so we increased the queue speed by 5x. And it worked well for maybe half an hour or so and then all of a sudden the cache collapsed again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we're restarting, we're trying to investigate, doing our best and going as fast as we can to make sure everybody can go in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why are Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 players enduring this eternal loading? And why, when players do manage to get into the game, are they seeing content they shouldn't or not displayed properly?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The issue that causes this is pretty much, when that service fails it restarts, it retries, it retries,” Wloch said. “First of all, that creates extremely long initial loading, which is not supposed to be as long. And after a certain time it will fail. If the missing data is blocking, you will not finish the loading — stop at 97% — and get a message. That means you need to restart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And if the content was not completely blocking you may enter the sim and then maybe there's a few planes missing, maybe there's some content missing, and that's all due to the same problem with that server and service.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope is that Asobo fixes this problem as soon as possible; Wloch said that once the server issues are sorted out players shouldn’t see the queue screen they’re currently experiencing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While it’s a great launch day, we know a lot of people are frustrated,” Neumann concluded. “We're really sorry. We want to apologize. We have some problems today. The team is on it, and we will keep going.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
