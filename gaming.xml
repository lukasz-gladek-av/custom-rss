			<p>Electronic Arts (EA) reported its Q1 2026 financial results a few hours ago, beating expectations with a revenue of $1.3 billion (+4.84% over the estimates and 3% more than last year). This is certainly a great setup for the publisher ahead of highly anticipated game launches, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skate</a>, and The Sims through <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Rene</a>. Will EA join other publishers <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Nintendo</a> in raising game prices beyond $70, though?</p>



<p>It doesn't seem like that's happening, at least for the time being. In the ensuing Q&amp;A with investors, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said (excerpt from <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-electronic-arts-q1-2026-beats-eps-estimates-93CH-4158698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Investing.com</a>):</p>



<p><em>We’re not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage, but that’s in the construct of we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free to play through to our premium products and our deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value. We’ll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet.</em></p>



<p>That's great news for gamers interested in games such as Battlefield 6. It may be a conscious decision on EA's part. The publisher is looking to attract <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a big audience</a> for this new installment in the military shooter franchise, after all, and setting a price that many consumers are not comfortable with would be counterproductive.</p>



<p>EA has set the multiplayer reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for tomorrow</a>. Livestreamed events will take place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London and kick off at 11:30 AM Pacific Time. We'll have our own Kai Tatsumoto in Los Angeles to play the game and report his first impressions.</p>

        <p>Yes, every Peak headline I write will contain the same pun</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Well, after a prolonged period of teasing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games look to have bitten the human bullet. Nestled among the notes for the climbing game's latest patch are the words "added cannibalism".</p>
<p>It's not enough that you can mod Peak so that you and your buddies will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">surrounded by the corpses of fallen climbers</a> as you attempt to do an Edmund Hillary. The folks behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> want you to casually nibble on your colleagues on the way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Fine," the devs wrote on the smouldering remains of the Tweeter as they deployed patch 1.10.a, which allows you to eat people. The notes don't provide any more details as to how this cannibalism works, but I assume you just walk up to a fellow mountaineer, politely ask permission, and then start munching away.</p>
<p>Maybe don't start with the feet. That advice isn't based on any previous experiences I've had in real life, I assure you. Looking <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aggrocrabgames.bsky.social/post/3luil6jpkzs2a">directly into their eyes</a> as you devour their elbows probably isn't a good idea either.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Aside from the whole eating people thing, this Peak patch adds in a new setting called "Climbing Extra Field Of View", which lets you control how the FOV changes as you climb, and a push to mute button that I was going to accuse of being a means by which to silence cannibalism objectors until I realised it works like reverse push to talk. Polish and Turkish language support has also arrived.</p>
<p>Fittingly for a cannibalism update, a few food and cooking-related balancing tweaks have been made, including one that stops well-done snacks from being de-buffed if you stash them away for later.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch of bug and performance fixes, with the devs having dealt with some wildflowers and temporarily disabled the Napberry plant in a bid to help things run better. They've also had a go at nixing a bug that leads you to take a "significant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance", but it seems their temporary solution has only addressed instances of this that involve "sliding down while holding the wall", so efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>Digest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391">the full notes</a> if you want the rest. Well, unless you're saving space for a buddy you plan to devour on the way to the summit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch]]></content:encoded>

Given the two games are likely to be launching reasonably close together, and will be frantically competing for the same audience, it’d be madness to deliberately out-price the rival. However, Wilson said on the call that $80 prices hadn’t been factored into any of EA’s projected earnings through March 2026. Now, that could be because the company wanted to low-ball and report unexpected profits, or it could always have been planning to release <em>BF6</em> at the previous upper price.</p><p>Of course, when pre-orders are announced there will inevitably be ways to spend <em>vastly</em> more than $70 on <em>Battlefield 6</em>, with ludicrous bundles offering imaginary doodads and different dress-up options for your soldiers for possibly hundreds of dollars. Seventy will get you the very basic version of the game, without a season pass, DLC, etc, and it’ll make sure to let you know what a pedestrian person you are as you choose it. Fortunately, there’s the far smarter option of never pre-ordering anything, because <em>it’s a scam</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VALORANT, the competitive first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, was recently <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-11-02/">updated</a> to Unreal Engine 5.3, and, for once, the engine delivers better performance than its predecessor.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by MxBenchmarkPC puts the game running in Unreal Engine 4 and in Unreal Engine 5.3 side by side on a system powered by an RTX 4070 GPU, highlighting how the UE5.3 version of the game generally runs at higher framerates. Visuals, on the other hand, are almost identical, with only some marginal improvements, which was expected, considering the developer's statements before the patch went live and the competitive nature of the game. The new version of the game also shows an increase in CPU load, RAM and VRAM usage, which may impact some low-end machines, although no report has been shared regarding any massive performance issue on such systems.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="VALORANT Unreal Engine 5 Update vs UE4 - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4070" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZyP5yWxgnjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's almost unbelievable to see a game powered by Unreal Engine 5 run so smoothly, without its known stuttering issues. Epic is well aware of these issues, and Software Engineer Ari Arnbjörnsson recently hosted a talk aptly named T<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/">he Great Hitch Hunt</a> during Unreal Fest 2025, highlighting the causes of the widespread stuttering issues and providing some advice to developers to minimize the issues.</p>



<p>One of the latest games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is the soulslike WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Although far from being one of the UE5 games with the worst performance to date, the experience crafted by Leenzee Games still leaves something to be desired from a technical standpoint, as even a powerful GPU like my RTX 4080 needed Frame Generation to hit 60 frames per second at 4K resolution. You can learn more about these performance issues, which the development studios is currently working to improve, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">review.</a></p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch has gone live today, introducing many improvements and new features, including Frame Generation support on PC.</p>



<p>One of the biggest additions featured in the v1.4.0 patch is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS Frame Generation and Low Latency support, which allow users with compatible GPUs to enjoy smoother gameplay with lower input lag. The new patch also packs plenty of quality of life improvements, including a Battle Retry option allowing players to quickly retry after losing a battle, a Lumina Cost Display which clearly displays the Lumina cost of each ability in the Pictos menu, an Autoplay dialogue option outside cutscenes, and separate volume sliders to adjust music volume for exploration and combat.</p>



<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch also features some balance changes, a few bug fixes and some visual polish improvements across multiple areas. You can learn more about these fixes by checking out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499454457318211676?l=english">here.</a></p>



<p>Even without the welcome improvements above, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was a more than worthy RPG to experience at launch, thanks to its great character and story and an involving turn-based combat system.

<p>The update was orginally set to go out today, July 30th, but will now go out tomorrow, July 31st. The tsunami warning that's led developers FromSoftware to have to switch up their plans is one of many consequences of a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>

<p>Here's hoping everyone in the affected places can stay safe.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-due-to-tsunami-warning]]></content:encoded>

Addressing the situation, The Pokémon Company said it "deeply apologize[d] for any inconvenience" and was now conducting a review of all other cards, to ensure no other designs were at fault.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"To our community, thank you for your continued support and passion for Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket," The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "We want to share an important update regarding the upcoming expansion, Wisdom of Sea and Sky. It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illustration of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards. As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are also conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, obtaining the card shows an empty card design with awkward-looking "New Art Coming Soon"  text — and then a black screen in place of the card's immersive artwork. It doesn't look great.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Holy cow guys I can’t believe I opened this in Pokemon TCG pocket 🤯 <a href="https://t.co/3st3ILATSW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3st3ILATSW</a></p>— Poli (@ProfPoliwag) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfPoliwag/status/1950448109042962439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's controversy, which came after the Wisdom of Sea and Sky's card designs were datamined and examined online, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">sparked a wider discussion over the Pokémon's legal terms for fanart</a> — which appear to suggest the company could, if it wanted, do whatever it liked with fan-made designs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's action strongly suggests that while The Pokémon Company may legally be able to argue it can use fan designs, it in practice does not want to typically do so, or leave fans thinking it now sees fanart as fair game for its commercial use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pokémon world to life, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused," The Pokémon Company continued. "We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control processes to prevent this from happening again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for your understanding, patience, and continued support of Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket.

Right: Ianjiujiu's original design.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN yesterday, video game industry legal expert Richard Hoeg, host of the Virtual Legality podcast, said The Pokémon Company's legal terms on fan art act as an acknowledgement that fans will create their own Pokémon art — but that ultimately, from a legal standpoint, any publicly-shared designs fall under the ownership of The Pokémon Company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It effectively says 'Look, we (TPC/Nintendo) are legally still the only ones allowed to make derivative works (fan art included), but we all know you're going to do it," Hoeg said of the terms, "so if you do, on the off-chance it's special, we can use it without otherwise paying you (since it was ours to begin with)'."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's statement, however, suggests Pokémon TCG Pocket will not be featuring any more fan art anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"From that point on, the studio’s management and the working conditions of its employees were brought under the direct control of the group.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Following our acquisition, and after two years of continued development adapting to tight time and resource constraints, the Aheartfulofgames team delivered </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The project was completed on schedule and without production issues. After launching in October 2024, the game met the commercial expectations set by Outright."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, however, the team claims they were essentially put out to pasture by their parent company. They allege that Outright, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.emkcapital.com/news/emk-acquires-majority-stake-in-outright-games-ltd">which is backed by UK-based private equity firm EMK Capital</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, neglected to provide work to the studio to justify an impending closure.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-igda-calls-wave-of-adult-game-delistings-a-form-of-creative-suppression-" target="_self" data-discover="true">The IGDA calls wave of adult game delistings a form of 'creative suppression'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They say the studio was quickly ostracised after Outright appointed Robin Flodin as its new CEO in October 2024—a move they claim "marked a turning point in company management, leading to a shift in strategic priorities that, from our perspective, signalled a consistent lack of interest and minimal engagement from Outright regarding its responsibilities to our studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It became increasingly clear to teams across the group that the new leadership was prioritising low-cost, fast-turnaround projects, a strategy which tends to lead to lower quality outputs and a deterioration in working conditions," they add.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aheartfulofgames claims it repeatedly attempted to spin up projects over the past 12 months, but that Outright quashed those plans without explanation—even when pitches were "positively received" by prospective licensors. In addition, the team alleges that Outright prevented them from assisting the company's other internal studios with their projects, with the firm instead choosing to outsource that work.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-details-how-uk-online-safety-act-will-impact-xbox-players" target="_self" data-discover="true">Microsoft details how UK Online Safety Act will impact Xbox players</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We received requests from Outright UK to support a project being developed by their internal team. Despite reportedly having outsourcing contractors involved, the project seemed to be falling short of expectations. To our knowledge, this internal team remains active and fully staffed," continues the statement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Over the course of these months, the frequency and scope of internal communications from Outright to Aheartfulofgames progressively diminished, culminating in May 2025, when our studio was explicitly excluded from a corporate group meeting."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;They thought they were going to reap a lot more than they are reaping now&quot;">"They thought they were going to reap a lot more than they are reaping now"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aheartfulofgames says Outright justified the closure on the grounds of "productive causes," but reiterates its claim that it was actively prevented from taking on new projects.a It adds that Outright continues to produce titles at a steady pace, but has instead turned to working with outsourcing studios such as Casual Brothers, Ardmand Games, 3DClouds, and PHL Collective instead of providing its internal teams with work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Outright chose to outsource development of these projects to third parties while our team remained available, working and receiving salaries, a decision for which no economic rationale has been provided," it adds.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-cloning-horizon-series" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony files lawsuit against Tencent for allegedly cloning Horizon series</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our operational capacity would have allowed us to take on one of these projects in parallel with our ongoing work, thereby making better use of resources while continuing to develop strategic and creative proposals aimed at securing more ambitious opportunities for Outright. Although we received, and proactively submitted several initial licence pitches, as mentioned above, none were formalised by Outright."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about the situation, three current Aheartfulofgames employees—who chose to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal—explain Outright's acquisition of the studio initially seemed like a blessing. They say the company immediately pledged to expand the dev team—and quickly made good on that promise—while also outlining a plan to have Aheartfulofgames progressively work on bigger and more expansive licensed titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source explains the deal appeared to provide the team with "safety and stability" in the wake of the pandemic, and admits there was plenty of optimism following the move.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They came to us with promises, not only of bigger and better licenses, but also growth within the company. They made us believe they had a plan," adds another source. "They gave our managers some sense of calm after three years of very difficult times—you know, after spending years trying to close deals during the pandemic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper, then, the deal was simple: Outright would keep the work flowing in Aheartfulofgames' direction, and the Spanish studio would continue to produce licensed titles that would enable its parent company to bolster its reputation and footprint.&nbsp; The reality, it seems, failed to deliver on that promise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the appointment of Flodin as CEO last year, one source explains the situation became increasingly "unstable" with pitches being turned down without reason. The sense, according to those we spoke with, is that Outright wanted to move in a new strategic direction towards cheaper projects and licenses. "That isn't what they promised to us," says one source. "So suddenly we became a liability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They say the decision to shutter Aheartfulofgames was verbally communicated during an internal meeting in July. At the time of writing, the studio is slated to be shuttered in mid-August.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Employees are now fighting for their livelihoods. All three sources explain they have been in negotiations with Outright in a bid to find an alternative route forward. They say they have tabled a number of proposals including a relocation plan and partial layoffs, all of which have been rejected by Outright. They claim their parent company isn't interested in negotiating about anything other than the serverance packages that will ultimately result in 28 people losing their jobs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It feels like they have their mind set on closing us at any cost," says one source. "They tell us we are just not competitive enough, but we were being super competitive when we finished </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and suddenly, the moment we stopped working on that project, we became uncompetitive," they continue. "We couldn't be afforded another project. Not small projects or large projects. Suddenly no project fits our [studio] size."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source says it feels as if the decision to shutter Aheartfulofgames was made by looking at numbers on an Excel sheet in a bid to figure out how to make even more money for management and investors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the end, to them, it's just about money. About getting more profit. I think it's bad for the industry in general and our creative world that this is happening all over the world," they add.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Emotionally, it has taken a huge toll. We have a really good team. We were working in really good conditions. Our studio managers were always trying to be fair [...] and it's really sad to lose something that was working well. Especially because we were trying to make games that weren't just about making money, but also about doing creative things and giving people in the team the ability to take part in creative decisions. For all of us it has been hard to lose that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, one source explains the closure appears to be a cynical decision made to appease investors who perhaps expected to prosper more off the back of a perceived game industry gold rush.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They thought they were going to reap a lot more than they are reaping now," they say. "And they have made it clear this isn't an economic decision, but the economic context provides them an explanation for what they are doing—but they are not losing money, they're gaining less."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Outright Games for comment.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

However, even tsunamis have, so far, been minor. Despite this, evacuations are vital, with reports that waves <em>could</em> reach 10 feet in Japan. As such, <em>Elden Ring</em> developers FromSoftware have left their offices and canceled July 31's planned release of Patch 1.02.</p><p>“Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula,” reads FromSoft’s statement, “we have decided to postpone the distribution of the ‘<em>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</em>’ Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST / 1:00 PDT.”</p><p>Duo Mode was due to add the ability to play <em>Nightreign</em> in pairs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981">a feature fans have been begging for since the game’s release</a></span>. The game was launched designed to be played in groups of three, which is an unusual group size for multiplayer gaming, and clearly far harder to pull together than just partnering up. The lack of a two-player mode felt even more strange, though, given you could also play solo. Two days after the game came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">a modder created an unofficial two-player option</a></span>, demonstrating it was certainly possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware said at the time</a></span> that not including duos was rather oddly “overlooked during development,” and that the game had only been balanced for three-player play.

            <p>The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> - that is to say, the wildly popular trading card mobile game - has released a statement apologising to its community following a report that highlighted a piece of fan artwork which had been copied to create a card, saying it was provided "incorrect reference materials".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Pokémon fan artist posted some comparison images of their own artwork of Legendary bird Ho-Oh next to an image of an upcoming card from Pokémon TCG Pocket's 2025 expansion, which had been datamined. This datamined card showed the Pokémon in the same pose as the fan artwork, with others surmising that the image had been traced (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">IGN</a>).</p><p>

You can see the two images below, with the fan art on the right:

<p>Now, the Pokémon TCG Pocket team has released a statement about its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-pocket-gets-new-johto-themed-packs-alongside-trading-update">upcoming expansion Wisdom of Sea and Sky</a>, writing:</p>
<p>"It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illusion of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-star) and Lagia EX (3-star).</p>
<p>"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect reference materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p>

<p>As such, the developer has said it will now replace these cards with placeholders for the time being, while it works to provide new artwork as soon as it is able. It will also conduct further investigations "to ensure no similar issues" are present elsewhere within the game itself.</p>
<p>"To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pokémon world to life, we deeply apologise for any inconvenience this has caused," the developer wrote. "We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control process to prevent this from happening again."</p>
<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket developer closed by thanking its community for their understanding and patience, as well as the continued support. "We remain dedicated to delivering an experience that you can enjoy," it said.</p>

            <p>There are some mods that you need to read up on before you understand why you might want to give them a whirl. There are some mods with which that process can be accomplished via a single GIF. A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> work that makes it possible to hilariously reduce the contents of Cyrodiil's cities to chunks of flying rubble just by slapping buildings with spells is firmly in the latter camp.</p>
<p>Before you get too worried about the karmic balance of the modding wizard powerful enough to make this sort of wanton destruction possible, it's worth bearing in mind that they've previously given players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">the ability to build new homes</a> any displaced citizens could probably move into.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Oblivimaster tweaker MadAborModding, whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-delivering-fallout-4-style-settlement-building-reckons-the-game-could-still-usher-in-a-modding-renaissance">we interviewed about his work earlier this month</a>, has clearly been busy since that point. His latest mod, as its name on Nexus Mods yells in all caps, lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4943?tab=description">DESTROY BUILDINGS</a>. I usually like text to keep the hollering to a minimum, but honestly I think he's earned it here.</p>
<p>As the GIFs on the mod page and the below showcase video from Reddit show off, the modder's developed a means of getting Oblivion Remastered's buildings to hilariously explode into bits when you fire spells at them. It's glorious. Well, unless you're an NPC living in some stone tower that's just been uprooted and sent spinning into the sky.</p>
<p>"This is only possible because of Unreal, the creation engine in any other Bethesda game wouldn't let you do this," the building batterer wrote in the thread below the video, "But in unreal, all you gotta do is flip a few true/false flags."</p> 
<p>Don't worry, though, the effects of any impromptu demolition you get up to aren't permanent, with everything resetting to normal when you next hit a loading screen. On one hand, that's maybe disappointing if you're eyeing up a playthrough in which, to paraphrase Walter White, you are the Oblivion Crisis. Though, given how much lobbing staircases into the stratosphere would inconvenience the story, I reckon MadAborModding's right to pitch this as temporary fun.</p>
<p>That said, he sounds like he's far from done working on it. Future plans include giving buildings their own health stats and a visible health bar, as well as letting you hack chunks out of them with non-magical attacks. That'd bring the mod closer to a full-blown house fighting experience, something I didn't know I wanted in Oblivion, but now definitely do.</p>
<p>The option to limit the destruction to specific areas of the game is also in the works. As of right now, the mod comes with its own optional tweaking menu thanks to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4810">Mad Mod Config Menu</a>, in case you fancy messing with the explosion radius or enabling anti-gravity.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the mod a go, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> is a hard requirement. I wish your hardware the best in coping with the amount of fireplaces that're about to be whizzing around the Imperial province.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-mod-delivers-tamrielic-teardown-by-letting-you-blow-buildings-to-bits-with-plans-for-full-blown-house-fighting]]></content:encoded>

As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it’s ready.”</p><p>It sounds like well-loved illustrator Sie Nanahara was provided references either by Creatures Inc (the team behind <em>PTCG</em> art) or DeNA (the developers of this app) that included fan-made art, rather than previous official Pokémon artworks. This explanation lifts responsibility from the artist which—as we’d suggested previously—would have been a very surprising move by a very established creator. </p><p>“Immersive cards” are the animated collectibles that appear in every set of the digital card game. They are one of the top selling-points of the app, offering magical cards that play out beautiful animated sequences when clicked on.

However, given the Ho-Oh and Lugia cards are animated, these will take vastly longer to create, often requiring enormous artworks for the camera to pan around, or complex 3D animations.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Despite reports to the contrary, it doesn't look like Battlefield 6 will cost $80 after all, as publisher EA is shunning the move to that kind of pricing for its games, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>Following EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx">latest financial report</a>, CEO Andrew Wilson took part in an earnings call with investors, where the company exec was asked about other publishers releasing $80 games, like Nintendo did with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," Wilson replied, adding EA already offers "a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products" (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Continuing, Wilson said: "When you think about everything from free-to-play through to our premium products and deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value.</p>
<p>"We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p>
<p>During the same call, it was confirmed that EA had not factored in any price changes to its  current fiscal year earnings guidance, meaning games releasing prior to March 2026 aren't expected to retail for $80. That includes Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-details-including-an-october-release-date-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal">which was recently suggested to be releasing with an $80 price tag attached</a>.</p>
<p>The conversation around game pricing has been more prevalent in recent times. Earlier this year, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford made waves when he suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">if you were a true fan you would purchase Borderlands 4 whatever the price may be</a>. This comment was met with backlash, so the Gearbox exec then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">attempted to justify his comments with a video</a> shared on social media. Here, he admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 would cost. More recently, we found out Borderlands 4 will actually sell for $70, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-stoked-about-borderlands-4s-70-price-point-confirms-tonne-of-dlc-on-the-way">Pitchford is "stoked" about that</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just last week, Microsoft walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 this 'holiday season', saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-bullishly-hiking-xbox-games-to-80-microsoft-confirms-u-turn-starting-with-the-outer-worlds-2">it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-may-not-be-80-after-all-as-ea-shuns-higher-priced-games-for-now]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-dominates-playstation%E2%80%99s-q2-2025-top-10-chart-in-the-us.1256805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has been heavily criticized by some of its fans for sharing Xbox exclusives with rival platforms like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch consoles. On one hand, this has inevitably aggravated the issue of Xbox hardware sales, which have admittedly been on the decline for some time. On the other hand, though, the change of policy appears to be starting to pay dividends for the Redmond-based giant.</p>



<p>Mat Piscatella, Executive Director &amp; Video Game Industry Analyst at Circana (formerly NPD), has shared the following chart from the firm's upcoming Q2 Games Market Dynamics report <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3luzr5q2qac27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on BlueSky</a>:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Q2 2025 Top 10 Best-Selling Games on PlayStation Platforms</td><td>(Physical and Full Game Digital from digital data sharing publishers in the Digital Leader Panel)</td><td> Ranked on Dollar Sales </td><td>Reporting Period: April 6-July 5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Last Quarter Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Publisher</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW</td><td>Forza Horizon 5</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>NEW</td><td>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>MLB: The Show 25</td><td>Sony (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>NEW</td><td>Doom: The Dark Ages</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>NEW</td><td>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>Minecraft</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</td><td>Ubisoft</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>WWE 2K25</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In Q2 2025, Microsoft practically dominated the PlayStation Top 10 chart in the United States with five games: the evergreen Minecraft, the steady <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, and the newly released ports of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. The Top 10 chart is completed by Sony's MLB: The Show 25 (also a multiplatform game), Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows, another evergreen (Grand Theft Auto V), and WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>It could even be argued that the revenue Microsoft is getting from PlayStation (and Nintendo) platforms will essentially cover the lost revenue caused by putting those games on Game Pass on Microsoft's Xbox and PC. In that light, the switch to multiplatform might suddenly be much more palatable.</p>



<p>Circana has also shared the overall Top 10 best-selling games in the United States this past month:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Last Month Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Publisher</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Elden Ring: Nightreign</td><td>Bandai Namco Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>NEW</td><td>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</td><td>Sony</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>NEW</td><td>Mario Kart World</td><td>Nintendo</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>185</td><td>Stellar Blade</td><td>Sony</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>Forza Horizon 5</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>MLB: The Show 25</td><td>Multiple Video Game Publishers</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>Minecraft</td><td>Multiple Video Game Publishers</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>NEW</td><td>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</td><td>Marvelous Entertainment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>FromSoftware has postponed its next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update due to a tsunami warning.</p>
<p>The update was initially meant to go out today, 30th July, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed">introduce the much sought after two-player mode</a>, as well as some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options. However, following the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t">recent earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula</a> - which has seen the cancellation or postponement of several other events, as well as evacuations in some parts of the US west coast and Japan - the developer has pushed the release of the update back.</p>
<p>Instead, the update - known as Patch 1.02 - will now go live tomorrow, 31st July. It is scheduled for after 9am UK time.</p>

<p>Additionally, the second cycle of Elden Ring Nightreign's Everdark Sovereign event, which was initially planned to go live following patch 1.02's release, has also been delayed until "after the update file has been distributed". This cycle will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">introduce enhanced Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415327042404555">Writing on social media</a>, the Elden Ring Nightreign team thanked players for their "understanding".</p>
<p>Along with the upcoming duo mode, there is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">DLC for Elden Ring Nightreign in the pipeline</a>, though it remains unknown what this will include or its date of arrival.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>A good keyboard is essential if you spend any time at all with your desktop or laptop. Whether you’re about to write the next Game of Thrones – I mean, somebody should – or you’re trying to get into the Platinum club in Overwatch 2, these are keys that you’re going to press hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times. As such, they’d better feel pretty damn amazing, and, as a starting point, the Keychron K2 HE nails the introduction.</p>
<p>The Keychron K2 HE is a 75% Wireless Magnetic Switch Keyboard. 75% referring to the reduced footprint that does away with the additional keypad, and shuffles the surrounding keys a bit closer together, while retaining all of a keyboard’s core functionality. Our review unit was the K2 HE Special Edition, which boasts a black and brown colour scheme, with premium-feeling rosewood trim and RGB lighting. The regular edition initially looks more restrained, but benefits from shine-through keycaps that let your RGB colours shine through the lettering.</p>



<p>The K2 HE Special Edition is fitted with Nebular Linear Gateron magnetic switches and Hall Effect sensors, hopping onto the same trend that has come to dominate pro controllers in the last few years, and using magnetic fields as opposed to metal contacts to detect when a key is depressed, removing a point of wear from the equation as there’s less friction between internal components, and allowing for more customisation potential.</p>
<p>Gateron switches have also come to the forefront of switch tech thanks to their incredibly smooth actuation, and the properties of these particuar linear key switches with dual rails lives up to that. In some circles, they’re even thought to eclipse the Cherry line of mechanical switches which have been the apex predator of the keyboard world for many years. In use? The Gateron keys feel and sound absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>They make the Keychron K2 HE immediately satisfying to use, and every key press feels assured and comfortable. It’s hard to express just how different they feel over regular button tech, or mechanical keys, but placing your fingers on them feels more like an elaborate dance than mashing buttons together, making typing and gaming feel exceptionally smooth.</p>
<p>Besides the fantastic feel of the keys themselves, the Keychron K2 HE boasts a 1000hz polling rate, which means that it ‘speaks’ to your computer multiple times in a fraction of a second. The result is improved response time, and through several Overwatch 2 sessions I felt lightning fast, or, at least, as fast as my ageing fingers will go. This is a decidedly understated keyboard for gaming, but it’s got the technical chops to make it an excellent choice for people who want a more mature look for their gaming setup.</p>

<p>The one potential downside is that the frame of the Keychron K2 HE is surprisingly thick, raising the overall profile of the keyboard by a few millimetres beyond my current FNATIC setup. Through extended typing, I did find myself wanting a wrist rest, though I didn’t notice the need during gaming sessions, presumably due to the set position I hold my hand and arm in. It’s worth considering whether you’ll need a wrist rest based on your own use case, but I wouldn’t be surprised to discover that you do.</p>
<p>The Keychron K2 HE is set up initially for use with a Mac, and thanks to that, all the buttons are suitably Apple-flavoured when you take it out of the box. Keychron do however give you a full set of replaceable buttons to match with Windows, and they’re semi-easy to remove and replace.</p>
<p>There’s an included tool that’s supposed to clip onto the key cap and let you pull it up, but I didn’t have the best experience with it. I found instead that it was just easier to use it as a lever, and the caps come off easily enough, while replacing them with the new cap is a doddle. It’s nice to have the choice, but I wouldn’t want to hop back and forth between Windows and Mac platforms too often, thanks to the slight faff, and ultimately each time you do it you run the risk of scratching the keys.</p>
<p>One of the most welcome innovations in gaming and PC peripherals is the move to web configurators that let you configure your device through your browser, rather than downloading a separate app. Keychron’s implementation is spot on, and from here you can remap keys, create macros, and setup the RGB lighting, giving you full control over the K2 HE with as little fuss as possible. More of this, please.</p>

<p>What’s particularly special about Hall Effect keyboard, though, is that unlike with mechanical, optical or – <em>shudder</em> – membrane keyboards, you can customise the actuation point. The point at which depressing a key is recognised by the keyboard is set not by those physical contacts, or the point at which light passes through a cut out of plastic, but just by the change in magnetism, and that can be incredibly precise. Of a total 4mm of travel, you can configure the Nebular Linear Gateron keys to trigger from anywhere between 0.5mm and 3.8mm. That can allow for exceptionally shallow key presses that can, frankly, be completely impractical.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of other features built around this, including <span data-pf-type="Text">Last Keystroke Prioritization (LKP) and Snap Click – somewhat controversial “Snap Tap” features that are banned in some games – having multiple actions triggered by a half and full press of a key, and even a full-on analogue mode that can be like a gamepad trigger in a racing game.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming MMORPG Chrono Odyssey recently held the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first limited-time Closed Beta test on Steam</a>, and the first impressions weren't exactly lavish in praise. The game featured several performance, balance, and polish issues, all of which are being addressed by South Korean developer Chrono Studio.</p>



<p>This morning, the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2873440/view/532104920883537322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the second part of its CBT Notes. Earlier this month, they had addressed some key concerns regarding animation and combat responsiveness and performance, promising the addition of popular upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR.</p>



<p>Today, though, the studio addressed in great detail the changes coming to most of the systems seen in the Chrono Odyssey beta. For combat, input responsiveness is being significantly improved through several tweaks, including better client-server packet transmission and optimized network performance. Hit reactions will occur more frequently and include knockback effects, making them easier to recognize; the duration of crowd control effects (CC) will be increased to 2-4 seconds, allowing more opportunities for follow-up attacks. Damage feedback is also being enhanced, with new hit reaction animations added based on the type of enemy attack, improving the visibility of effects like stagger and knockback, and sound and camera effects introduced to improve the feeling of impact. Weapon sweeping will feel faster, too, thanks to a shortened buffer window.</p>



<p>The skill system is also changing. Each weapon will support four combat styles, and skills across different weapons will synergize. A skill tree node system called Matrix will be added to provide different progression paths for all these playstyles. Needless to say, all classes in Chrono Odyssey will have to be rebalanced following this change.</p>



<p>Monster AI will be improved to ensure monsters respond more effectively to ranged attacks, and Chrono Studio is also planning to smooth those frankly ridiculous difficulty spikes that players ran into during the Closed Beta. </p>



<p>Even the game world is changing. Visually, region-specific features such as swamps, misty forests, wildflower fields, and grasslands will strengthen visual identity, and a dynamic grass system will be implemented, and the wind system will be improved to create immersive environmental interactions.</p>



<p>To make exploration more rewarding, the team plans to increase content density and introduce new exploration elements, such as themed caves, narrative encounters, and gathering opportunities at points of interest (POIs). New Dynamic Quests and Chain Quests will also be added, with hidden rewards such as rare achievements and exclusive titles as incentives to explore.</p>



<p>Beyond the main questline, meaningful events and quests are being introduced to Chrono Odyssey with unique, memorable characters tailored to each region. Certain quests will even offer player choices that influence their progression and conclusion. </p>



<p>Expedition Dungeons will include randomized elements to make each run unique. Depending on the path taken, players may encounter different bosses, treasure chests, and other events, creating a more dynamic experience. Replayability will be encouraged as well with the introduction of additional rewards for completing the same dungeon multiple times.</p>



<p>There's also a veritable mountain of smaller tweaks to the user interface, crafting system, tutorials, and social systems. While it's fantastic that Chrono Studio has addressed the user feedback in such amazing depth and is willing to improve the game in many core areas, the downside of that is the near-inevitable delay. Chrono Odyssey is currently still slated for 2025, but with all these changes on the way and the prospect of <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-qa-multiple-closed-beta-tests-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future beta tests</a> to evaluate them, it seems obvious that the game won't be released this year. Still, better to wait for a solid product than rush something out.</p>
