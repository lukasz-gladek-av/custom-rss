And although fans have pointed it out in the past, it was never addressed. Blu Scout’s pants, for the last 17 years, have been brown, which is incorrect. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1gbfv95/so_apparently_for_the_last_17_years_blu_scouts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1gbfv95/so_apparently_for_the_last_17_years_blu_scouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His pants should be grey, just like all the other classes on the Blu Team</a></span>. Brown pants are intended for Red Team members. Yet, this mistake has persisted for nearly two decades, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2289&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite the evidence</a></span>.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And then, out of nowhere, Valve fixed it</a></span>. Now Blu Scout’s pants are grey, which is nice, although it also means <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fo63oo3kk0swd1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D291d62f437c6c67d5d13b10f3f73cd15dbbe6abf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fo63oo3kk0swd1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D291d62f437c6c67d5d13b10f3f73cd15dbbe6abf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bunch of community-created cosmetics</a></span> for that character look ugly because they were designed with brown pants. </p><p>Why now, after 17 years, did Valve fix this long-known <em>TF2 </em>bug? We don’t know, and because Valve famously doesn’t explain many of their decisions or plans, your guess is as good as mine. </p><p>However, I have a theory about this change. Last year, around this same time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667">Valve fixed a very old bug in <em>Half-Life</em></a></span> involving a monster’s animation. I think as the year wraps up, Valve might let devs tinker as the holidays approach, and perhaps that’s why this patch has suddenly appeared. Maybe someone got a bit of free time and used it to hop into <em>TF2 </em>and correct this mistake? </p><p>Or perhaps Valve just likes trolling fans? Maybe both! Anyway, Scout’s pants are finally the correct color and we can all sleep easy knowing that the world is a better place. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations may have only just launched on October 25 (today as of writing), but it’s already hit a sales milestone. Sega has announced that the game has sold 1 million copies.</p>



<p>The sales numbers come from copies sold worldwide on all available platforms.</p>







<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is a remake of 2011’s Sonic Generations. Where it differs, however, is that it includes new content in the form of Shadow Generation.</p>



<p>“Sonic X Shadow Generations&nbsp;is a title that combines two games:&nbsp;Sonic Generations, where players can enjoy speed-running various stages with Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, enhanced with new elements, and&nbsp;Shadow Generations, a completely new game featuring the dark hero Shadow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>&nbsp;through dynamic environments,” Sega’s overview of the game reads.</p>



<p>“The story begins as a mysterious creature called the “Time Eater” creates distortions in time and space, setting off separate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s for Sonic and Shadow. Players can look forward to a high-speed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-adventure with distinct gameplay experiences and narratives.”</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

The movement is fast-paced and sweaty this year, so you'll want to make sure you have the best perks and Wildcards to suit your playstyle.

Take less fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a perk you might've overlooked in recent years, but it's a top choice for Black Ops 6. This perk is best suited for you if you plan on making the most of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6s-action-hero-movement-changes-call-of-duty-for-the-better-with-some-risks/1100-6526239/"> game's omnimovement</a>. The benefits work really well to help you keep more control for gunfights while sliding, diving, and jumping around.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV while moving, planting, defusing, or controlling.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. It's also a great choice to use for laying low with a sniper class.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja:</strong> Move more quietly</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 perks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed are so important in a fast-paced game like Black Ops 6. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Assassin:</strong> Enemies on a kill streak get a unique minimap marker and drop bounty packs when killed. Pick up the packs for more score.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Reduced score cost for non-lethal streaks. Stacks with Bankroll.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fast Hands and Assassin are going to be more popular picks for aggressive players, Dispatcher is a great pick if you like to lean into a support role. It's also great for leveling up faster, as you'll get your UAVs and other support streaks faster, equalling to more score opportunities.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Double Time:</strong> Greatly increased duration of Tactical Sprint.</p><p dir="ltr">This is going to be a popular pick for aggressive playstyles. This is the perk you want to run when you're the player rushing to capture hardpoints or just the run-and-gun playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk to pair with Dispatcher because it stacks. This is a great pick for getting your support streaks even faster, and together these perks should give you more opportunities to earn XP and level up fast.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded:</strong> It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as your Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch and save yourself, if you find you're in a match where you're getting hammered by lethal enemy streaks.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 brings back Treyarch's Wildcard system. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize your loadout to your preferred playstyle. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill:</strong> Equip and non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill is not a perk this year. If you want to run an additional primary weapon, you'll need to equip this wildcard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gunfighter:</strong> Get three extra attachments for your primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't decide on just five attachments for your gun, Gunfighter lets you add three more for a very powerful weapon build.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Perk Greed:</strong> Equip an extra perk.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always handy to have an extra perk, especially with so many good perks being stacked in the Tier 1 slot. This will let you equip Ghost and Ninja together for added stealth, and this is also a good combo for Search and Destroy players.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Specialty_bonuses">Specialty bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Combat Specialist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that perks are all labeled using three different categories: Enforcer (red), Recon (blue), and Strategist (green). If you fill your loadout with three perks from the same category, you'll get an additional bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">This won't always be the best route to take, but one combo that does work well and gives you decent perks with a helpful bonus is equipping <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Assassin</strong>, and <strong>Double Time</strong> for an aggressive playstyle. <strong>This earns you the Enforcer bonus</strong>, which grants you a temporary buff to movement speed and health regen rate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for Black Ops 6 weapon builds to pair with your perks, we have several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/#1">recommended builds to try in your next match of multiplayer</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're on console, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-settings/1100-6526279/">recommended settings guide</a> for getting the most out of Black Ops 6 on PlayStation or Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Congratulations are in order for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaptation of the iconic video game series has successfully managed to appease the streaming service gods and will be returning for a second season (not that I'm extremely bitter about Kaos' cancellation or anything) at some unspecified future point.
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft's debut season launched on Netflix earlier this month, whereupon I completely failed to watch it because I immediately cancelled my subscription after the whole Kaos incident (not that I'm still extremely bitter about 1899 or anything). However, enough people seem to like it despite middling reviews - and, probably more importantly, actually <em>watch</em> it - that Netflix is now ready to do it all again with a Season 2.
</p>
<p>
Netflix announced a second season for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, a fate regrettably not enjoyed by Kaos or 1899 (not that I'm still extremely bitter about Glow or anything), in a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1849828264686256596">message shared on social media</a>. "Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will return for SEASON 2!," it bellowed in several capital letters. "Lara will officially join forces with the one and only Sam Nishimura for an all-new adventure."
</p>

</div><figcaption>Oh yeah, and American Vandal was good too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh3jz8rvYBY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
That means when Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft makes a comeback (not that I'm still extremely bitter about The Santa Clarita Diet or anything), she'll finally have her bestie by her side after the character was notably absent in Season 1. Sam, of course, was introduced in Crystal Dynamics' 2013 Tomb Raider reboot and promptly disappeared from the series after that - although she did pop up in a prequel comic.
</p><p>
Netflix hasn't provided any hints as to when Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft's second, Sam-starring season might eventually arrive, but while we're all here, let's take quiet moment to remember the dearly departed likes of Kaos, 1899, Glow, The Santa Clarita Project, and that thing about the dead boy detectives, whatever you were called.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer this week, Tomb Raider 2013 writer Rhianna Pratchett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-series-ptsd-focus-was-something-game-writers-werent-allowed-to-explore-rhianna-pratchett-says">applauded the TV series' decision to touch on Lara's PTSD</a> after her early experiences, noting it "was an area we weren't allowed to explore in the games", despite the narrative team wanting to do so.

It’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder now for $49.99</a> and is expected to be released on November 29th, 2024.</p><p>The Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller can be attached to smartphones or smaller tablet devices measuring between 100mm and 170mm in length. For expanded compatibility, instead of plugging in with USB-C, 8BitDo’s new controller connects wirelessly over Bluetooth but only supports Android devices.</p><p>The use of Bluetooth necessitates a 350mAh rechargeable battery in the controller, which 8BitDo says is enough for 15 hours of play on a 1.5-hour charge. That added battery also means the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller weighs 236 grams, making it heavier than competitors’ offerings like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22753567/backbone-one-plus-iphone-gaming-controller-android-phones">Backbone One</a>, which connects through a device’s charging port and weighs 138 grams.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller features Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir’s G8 Plus smartphone controller</a>, 8BitDo is using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">drift-resistant</a> magnetic Hall effect sensors in its joysticks and triggers so players will potentially avoid experiencing unwanted movements or button presses while gaming. The controller also features a pair of shoulder buttons, a four-way directional pad with a “clicky” feel, turbo, macro, and profile buttons, and two additional programmable paddle buttons on the back.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller is compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software allowing it to be customized and reconfigured.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Unlike some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo’s more budget-friendly offerings</a>, the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller fully supports customization through the company’s Ultimate Software, which is available as a desktop and mobile app. In addition to remapping controls, creating macros, and even setting up multiple profiles, if you’re an FPS player, you can use it to adjust the sensitivity of the controller’s triggers so they’re more immediately responsive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278489/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a gamer looking to save but can’t wait until another a month until Black Friday, it might be worth checking out <a href="https://howl.me/cnnelayGOJc"><strong>Best Buy’s three-day gaming sale</strong></a>. Now through October 27th, the retailer’s offering discounts on gaming gear, but some of the best deals are on hardware specifically. </p><p>For example, Best Buy has some notable deals on Windows handheld consoles, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review"><strong>Asus ROG Ally</strong></a>, which is on sale&nbsp;with a Z1 Extreme chip for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnexVKi7NU">$549.99 ($100 off)</a> (and even cheaper at $499.99 for My Best Buy Plus and Total members). That’s $50 shy of its best price to date, and nearly half the price of its successor, the ROG Ally X. Admittedly, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">ROG Ally X</a>, offers more impressive performance and battery life, but the ROG Ally is still more powerful than Valve’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a> with a larger 1080p and 120Hz display. Alternatively, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review"><strong>Lenovo Legion Go</strong></a> is also on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd4I8l55Z">$599.99 ($150 off)</a> with 1TB of storage, which is one of its better prices to date. The handheld isn’t as fast or as lightweight as the ROG Ally, but it does offers a larger 8.8-inch 144Hz display so it can double as a decent Windows tablet. It also has detachable controllers and even a kickstand.</p><p>It’s not all pricey handhelds, either. Gaming accessories like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price"><strong>Scuf’s Nomad&nbsp;controller</strong></a><strong> </strong>have dropped to their best prices to date, selling for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd84vVxJJ">$79.99 ($20 off)</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SCUF-Wireless-iPhone-Mobile-Controller/dp/B0D49HBW9D/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> matching that deal too. A mobile controller for your iPhone, Scuf’s device is similar to&nbsp;rivals from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">Backbone</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23191199/razer-kishi-v2-mobile-game-controller-android-review">Razer Kishi</a> but offers full-size, drift-free Hall effect sticks. And while the video game deals aren’t as impressive, there are a few noteworthy ones to consider, like the  open-world&nbsp;title <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is down to one of its better prices to date of <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">$29.99</a> <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">($20 off)</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p><div><p>The ROG Ally is Asus’ first crack at a Steam Deck rival. It’s a Windows-based PC gaming handheld with a seven-inch 1080p, 120Hz touchscreen and integrated gamepad controls.</p></div><div><p>The clamp-style mobile controller works with the iPhone and offers a few pro-level features at a relatively low price, including full-size, drift-free Hall effect sticks (with swappable stick toppers) and a pair of customizable rear paddle.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more ways to save</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <strong>Ring Battery Doorbell Plus</strong>, our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera">top battery-powered video doorbell pick</a>, is down to an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Battery-Doorbell-detection/dp/B09WZBPX7K?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cnnc0e9JlIQ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-battery-doorbell-plus-8211-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell-with-head-to-toe-hd-video-satin-nickel%2F-%2FA-88293229">Target</a>. The doorbell boasts an impressive 1536p HD video resolution as well as a head-to-toe view, allowing you to get a better view of packages and visitors. Compared to other battery doorbells we’ve tested, the Plus is also more responsive. Other handy features include color night vision, live view, and two-way audio, though you’ll need to pay $4.99 subscription fee for other perks like recorded video and alerts for packages.</li><li>You can purchase a refurbished <strong>iRobot Roomba i4 Evo </strong>on sale from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F384464991557">eBay</a> for $129.99 when you apply the code <strong>HOLIDAYCHEER </strong>at checkout, which costs $320 less than buying it new. The Roomba i4 Evo is the upgraded version of our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23846479/best-budget-robot-vacuum-robot-mop">favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum</a>, the Roomba i3. Aside from offering a bigger battery, it’s otherwise identical and capable of mapping and cleaning your house just as well as the pricier, more capable Roomba j7. Bear in mind it lacks AI-powered obstacle avoidance and you can’t set virtual keep-out zones, but those are fair trade-offs at this price. </li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23902100/samsung-smarttag2-item-tracker-announce"><strong>Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag2</strong></a> starts at&nbsp;$21.22 ($9 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-SmartTag2-Bluetooth-Tracker-Tracking/dp/B0CCC69HN3/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, which is a little over $1 shy of its best price to date, while <a href="https://howl.me/cnmMTtAN8eI">Best Buy</a> has the device for $22.49. The ultra wideband tracker&nbsp;works with Samsung’s Galaxy Find network, making it a particularly great option for Samsung device owners looking to keeps tabs of their belongings. Unlike its predecessor, it also offers a more robust IP67 water and dust resistance rating and a user-replaceable battery capable of lasting up to 700 days.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, under the care of Renegade Studios, comes a re-release of the much sought-after Anniversary Edition of Axis &amp; Allies with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/axis-allies">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary Edition</a>, and at long last, fans and new players alike can once again find this elusive prize.</p><div catalogid="fce4d4e7-132d-4124-a571-858c1fd8c10c" id="209655"><div id="209655" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 40th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the Axis &amp; Allies franchise, the game places anywhere from two to six players in the roles of either the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) or the Allies (United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union) during various conflicts of World War II in the 1940s (with a few exceptions, such as A&amp;A 1914, set in World War I, and G.I. Joe: Battle in the Arctic Circle). </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary Edition</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many modern games of its type may rely on intricate tech trees, special abilities, and other systems, Axis &amp; Allies is one of the purest forms of war board games out there. It’s a game where you move your pieces around a large board, roll dice to win fights, and conquer cities to achieve victory—a game where solid strategy and planning matter most. This experience has helped the series survive for so long. Among the plethora of versions and multiple editions, this Anniversary Edition release is widely regarded by fans as the de facto version. It’s even featured as the game played in Renegade’s Axis &amp; Allies World Championship Tournament at this year's GenCon, thanks in part to a few unique aspects that make it stand out from its fellow A&amp;A siblings, like A&amp;A 1942, A&amp;A Pacific 1940, or A&amp;A Europe 1940.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spread across three large boards, Axis &amp; Allies includes both 1941 and 1942 scenarios to choose from, which dictate where players will place their starting units and the order in which each country takes its turn. From there, play alternates between countries placing new units, moving units, rolling dice to resolve attacks, and buying new units, with the end goal being to hold a certain number of special victory cities. Mix in some special rules for land, air, and sea units, and you have everything you need to enjoy one of the longest-running board game franchises of modern times – simple in concept, rich in depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those fortunate enough to have snagged a copy of the 2009 Anniversary Edition release, aside from a few visual adjustments for historical accuracy on the map (Honolulu now points to the correct island, for example), a bigger board, and a new FAQ section in the rulebook, Renegade’s new version is the same. All 672 miniatures retain the same detailed designs and can be easily stored in the returning nation-specific storage boxes, which are adorned with artwork that creates a collage when stored securely in the game’s box. All of the cardboard tokens are thick and sturdy, and the IPCs (the currency used to purchase new units) are still that same Monopoly-style paper. Though I’m not much of a fan of that myself, I opt for just a trusty notepad to keep track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The components all feel sturdy and honor the previous releases, but there are slight stumbles, and I wish Renegade had gone a bit further with their tweaks beyond just fixing grammatical hiccups. Of particular note, it is far too difficult to distinguish the various naval ships, especially the Destroyers, Transports, and Battleships. A subtle tweak to the sculpts or something similar would have been welcome (as a quick Google search shows, this complaint isn’t new). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some issues, such as units feeling cramped on their respective spaces on the map, can be alleviated somewhat by the <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/axis-allies-anniversary-edition-deluxe-map/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deluxe neoprene map</a> that is 20% larger, though it comes at an additional cost. All in all, though, for its $100+ price tag, the base Anniversary Edition is still a wonderfully produced board game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing through a game of the Anniversary Edition is an event unto itself that will easily take a day or more to complete, especially if you are a newcomer to the series. To put it into perspective, the games during the world tournament, featuring teams of some of the best players out there, were limited to six hours. While this may sound daunting, there is something truly magical about having a game that turns into a weekend-long event with your friends. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of length, the 40th Anniversary Edition finds itself in the middle range of the pack, with options like 1941 offering much of the same mechanics in a game that will only last a couple of hours. Alternatively, you can combine Europe and Pacific to create the utterly epic Axis &amp; Allies Global, which will take even the most experienced players months of weekends to complete (a dream of mine to do one day). Thanks to Renegade’s efforts in reprinting the series, it’s fairly easy to snag a copy of whichever version you prefer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODoAj?object_uuid=6a6ec016-5ea8-467c-9c4d-f8cf0cc82e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bl5j?object_uuid=6a6ec016-5ea8-467c-9c4d-f8cf0cc82e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Renegade</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 25, 2024 4:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary remains one of the best war-gaming experiences available in the board game space, and with Renegade’s reprinting, it is once again easy for fans and newcomers to obtain. Playing this game is an event unto itself, and its impressive table presence still makes me pause when it’s all set up. It may not be the best option for those who are just curious about the series, given the length of the games and its price point, but once you know that you enjoy the systems in Axis &amp; Allies, it’s an incredibly easy game to recommend.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We discussed how it came to be, what other iconic franchises did and didn't influence its creation, and much more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/25/cronos-the-new-dawn-key-art-logo-1729868817568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Chronos: The New Dawn is the next big game from Bloober Team.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Congratulations on the reveal! That must be very exciting and probably nerve-wracking. How long has Cronos been in development?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jacek Zieba:</strong> We started pre-production somewhere during the end of [2021 release] The Medium, the ideas and everything. When we finished The Medium parts of the team were designated to start doing Cronos, so now it's in an advanced state of production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wojciech Piejko:</strong> Before The Medium was finished, we sat with leads and other guys and came up with the new idea for the game and that was how Cronos was born.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> How does it feel now to finally have it out in the wild and show off what you've been working on for so long?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's surreal. Surreal and a big relief. It's always like a nerve-wracking thing. I think there are two big moments in development. Of course, the release, which is the most nerve-wracking one. But the second one is this, the moment we are sharing right now, showing the first trailer of the game, seeing the feedback</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was a big relief of course and a big moment for the company, that we are doing this two hit combo after releasing Silent Hill with all the great reception, and we are really thankful for all the players. And now this also seems to resonate with people. So we are super excited and super relieved. And of course it'll give us a second wind. 'Okay, now it's real. Now we need to finish it and fulfill the dream.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Is it difficult to actually just settle down now back into work today without constantly checking out the comments and the conversations around the trailer?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Exactly. It is what is happening in the studio since this morning. [Sharing] reaction videos and comments. We are really, really happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Was it a very planned and intentional move to reveal Cronos so soon after Silent Hill?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> In a way, yes, because we have two big teams, two big projects started some time ago. So yeah, we knew that this day would come that we can reveal it, but it's not like we made this decision two years ago or something. Those kind of decisions are very tricky and sometimes you just seize the moment like, 'Okay, this is the time now, we should do it here.' So it's like, you're sometimes just waiting and you are just prepared for this kind of stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Yeah, it's also like the stars are aligned. The reception of Silent Hill is great; now Microsoft wants us on their show. So okay, maybe that's good moment because we've got this trailer prepared and we were looking for a perfect moment. We saw a lot of comments like, 'How? Do you guys sleep?'</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I think it's fair to say the Silent Hill 2 remake is the biggest and most significant release for Bloober that has put you on the map more than any previous release. It had positive critical reception and you just announced one million sales too. Has that energized you? Has it influenced Bloober Team in other ways?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think that energized us, yeah. We proved we could do it as a team, as a company, because the team poured all their hearts into it. I think it was very tough for them, seeing what happened on the internet for years and to now say to everyone, 'Okay, you were wrong. We can do it and people really like it.' That's the most important stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People really like it so we can be in this together with players, because all of the people in Bloober are also big fans of Silent Hill and put a lot of love into their remake. So that's a big reward for everybody here. But yeah, it's a great success, the biggest as you said, but it only gave us energy to keep going further. That's our new strategy. It's not like, 'Let's just be bigger and bigger. Let's just create better and more interesting games than before.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> To be honest, I can't express enough how happy we are with the release of Silent Hill 2. The team did great, a really tremendous job against all the odds, against all the comments saying we don't deserve to touch this legendary game and everything. We are all fans of Silent Hill. So for us it was a dream come true. So of course it was hard for the team, but they overcome everything and made the impossible possible. We love the new version of Silent Hill, which is still true to the original and added some more content which people like. So yeah, we are thrilled. We are thrilled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Let's talk about Cronos. Can you give me the synopsis, the elevator pitch on what this game is?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Alright, so you are a traveler, a mysterious person hidden beneath this environmental suit and you've been sent to the ruins of human civilization with the goal of looking for time rifts. During your exploration you'll need to survive encounters, solve some puzzles, and overcome anomalies that you saw [in the trailer] like floating buildings and other elements. This is our own take on puzzles in this game and you need to look for the time rifts that I mentioned, jump back in time, and extract key people who didn't survive the apocalypse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What can you tell me about the apocalypse itself and what's clearly gone very wrong in this world?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think only the name of it! It's The Change. The Change happened and the rest is mystery at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> The Change happened in the eighties, in Poland. We love to share our culture and the environment and architecture in Poland. It's an alternative version of history. The Change, this apocalyptic event happened in the eighties, and that's where we are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> This is also why our sci-fi is more retro, something like Alien or the old Star Wars. So it's more analog than flashy. No new tech.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cronos: The New Dawn Bloober Team Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What are your other inspirations? Fans are comparing it to Dead Space and also seeing lots of classic survival horror like Silent Hill in it too</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Definitely Dead Space is there because of the protagonist and stuff, We can share a little about a special approach to combat. Just like Dead Space has the cut off the limbs mechanic, we also have something we will share later. Also like Alan Wake with the flashlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's something that brings up the tension. It's not only run and gun but you need to think. We put a little more strategy in the combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Besides those, Japanese survival horror, like the Resident Evil series, the old ones, the remakes. Those were a very, very big inspiration for us</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> In terms of movies, films like 12 Monkeys. Our biggest film or TV series inspiration is Dark, the TV series by Netflix. It tells a story about time travel and a fictional German town, so a very European thing. We thought the same, 'Okay, we can set the game in Poland. We can also use time travel.' This showed us we can do it and people are interested in it. We don't need to make the game about somewhere else. Let's show culture, let's show Poland. Oh and The Thing [is another inspiration].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Also Annihilation with Natalie Portman was a very, very big influence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Having mentioned these other game franchises, do you want Cronos to be a competitor to Resident Evil, to Silent Hill?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Our goal was to create our first IP in the survival horror genre because, of course, Silent Hill is a property of Konami and, we are really grateful and honored to be able to work on this game, but with Cronos we wanted to make something ours, with our vision of the survival horror game and mixing the elements that we have mastered through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were always a storyteller, so we still want to tell a good story, but this time we would like to also incorporate more gameplay into it. So expect a survival horror game like the games you mentioned, Resident Evil, Dead Space, Silent Hill. Those are the type of games we... We would like to be among them. But yeah, I think it's our own take. That was a goal of this journey of the new Bloober, to expand and have more gameplay oriented games but still telling good stories.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 25 Best Horror Video Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What lessons did you learn from The Medium that influenced the creation of Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ: </strong>I think <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-knew-it-had-to-evolve-after-releasing-the-medium">after The Medium it was very clear to us that we needed to evolve</a>. It was like, 'let's end the chapter of the adventure games.' Layers of Fear, Observer, and The Medium, [games that were] strange, experimental, with fixed camera tools. 'Okay, let's finish with that.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also want to evolve, so let's go into survival horror, let's create something of our own, something different than other games in the genre in terms of world, story, and also gameplay. Let's create another game of our dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's a privilege to make the games that you would like to play yourself for horror fans. We are in the studio making Silent Hill, Cronos. it's like a dream combination.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The general strategy of Bloomberg Team 3.0 is to redefine the genre, so how is this game doing that? What are your plans to make this the new benchmark for survival horror games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I don't know if we can say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> We've got these features, the one mentioned before, our take on combat. We are trying to expand the idea, not only of survival horror [mechanics] like a limited inventory and stuff, but also add some new ideas to it. I think it's all about the mixture, making different pizzas with different ingredients, and I hope this one will be really tasty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Which themes, of sci-fi or horror or time travel, did you lean into most when making Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> We of course knew that we were doing the Silent Hill game, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloober-team-made-cronos-the-new-dawn-sci-fi-to-not-step-on-the-toes-of-silent-hill-2-remake">we didn't want to overlap with, let's say a more grounded story</a>. We said, 'Okay, we will be doing this, so we need to go somewhere else to have a different world, to not repeat ourselves.' So yeah, that's how we came up with Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Cronos was in development when both the Dead Space remake and the Dead Space inspired Calisto Protocol came out. Was this a worry at all?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> We were concerned at some moment. Nobody knew about Dead Space remake when we started our production. And on Callisto, we were very curious on various levels as a developer, also as gamers, like how it'll play If this is a spiritual successor of Dead Space. And it wasn't good in the case of gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we could cool off, like, 'Okay, it's not new groundbreaking, survival horror, we can still have a shot.' And in case of Dead Space remake, it was just awesome to play it again and see how it's done and see how this can help us in our production. So definitely two interesting moments, but mostly we just learned something from it, more than be discouraged on our journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't think in categories like, 'Okay, people don't like Callisto or people don't like Dead Space Remake, so now we have a problem.' No, we are also doing something different than these two games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> As big fans of the genre, what excites you most about Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think there are two things. One I can say, the second one... So the main character, the Traveler, who they are, what's happening, why they're doing this, the suit... We put a lot of effort into building it, to make it something special, make it something different. And the second part is this combat part. But it's a secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> I would say the same. I'm really happy how the Traveler looks, how we designed the suit. That was something that we really wanted from the very beginning, to not have a typical soldier type, but more a diver, a diver in time, and that's great. I saw a lot of comments like, 'Whoa, I love this suit, love this.' I know! Yes, yes, it's great. I'm so happy about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Horror games often make their protagonists rather faceless, but it sounds like you have big plans for yours and your story. Is that right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Yes, of course. Yeah. I know that we are making a third person game with the character in the helmet, but you still learn a lot about yourself and your place in the world. I know we are starting very big because like, oh, the word is destroyed and stuff, but yeah, please remember we are Bloober. We like to tell an intimate story about people and characters and this will not be different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So with lots to it, do you think there is potential for more Cronos beyond The New Dawn?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Definitely, definitely, definitely. Yeah, we've got plans for Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Now going down this independent route then, making your own franchise, is Bloober still open to making, for example, another Silent Hill remake or even a brand new Silent Hill game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think that's a very tough and open question. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-open-to-making-more-silent-hill-games">I think we are always open</a>. If we like the opportunity, we'll take it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> There are opportunities that you have to seize. Like Silent Hill 2, you can remake the legend. So yeah, I do believe that everything's possible. We are also fans of the genre. If the IP is interesting we probably will also be interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You mentioned earlier that the Silent Hill 2 remake has been criticizedfor all sorts since its announcement, but now it's released everyone loves it. Has that reception increased Bloober's confidence?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think definitely, yes. It just gives all of us more confidence, I think definitely for the Silent Hill team, but also for us. Yeah, like 'We can do it. We can do that kind of crazy stuff.' We also love our previous games and some of them have better or worse reception, but still, we all put all our hearts into them and we also learn with each of them. So I think I'm only hyped to see how Cronos can land. And also what's further than Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Long story short, I think we all feel that we leveled up as developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor's Note: This interview was lightly edited for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Available to preorder now at Amazon, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller will be available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> variants starting November 29.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg"></figure><p>Like its high-end controllers, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller features triggers and joysticks with Hall Effect sensors, which prevents stick drift and generally offers a smoother feel. It also has two customizable rear triggers, a dedicated turbo button, and it'll fit any phone between 3.93 inches (100mm) to 6.69 inches (170mm) in length. That covers the vast majority of modern phones. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest phone, is 6.42 inches in length. The controller's design of this looks quite comfortable as well, as it adds a more traditional gaming profile to a phone.</p><p>It also supports 8BitDo's Ultimate Software, an easy-to-use customization suite that lets you remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and more.</p><p>The main, and fairly substantial, caveat here: It's only confirmed to support Android, but other 8BitDo controllers listed with Android-only mobile support have worked on iOS just fine. GameSpot has reached out to 8BitDo to see if official support for iOS is planned and whether it will work in some capacity with iPhones at launch.</p><p>Since the controller syncs via Bluetooth, not via USB-C like the Backbone, we would be surprised if it didn't support iOS. 8BitDo's other controllers do work with Apple devices via Bluetooth, and its Ultimate Software app is available through the iOS Store.</p><p>If it works at all--and again, we are speculating here--the Ultimate Software app is the key feature that could be missing on iOS. If 8BitDo doesn't or isn't able to add the controller to the list of devices that sync with the app on iOS, iPhone users wouldn't be able to remap inputs or make other adjustments--unless they also have an Android device or the controller is capable of syncing with the PC app to make changes. Remapped inputs and other adjustments are typically saved to the controller, so if you own an Android tablet or an old Android phone with 9.0 firmware or higher, you could theoretically make those changes on that device before using it on iPhone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589" data-ratio="0.6041095890411" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller has two ergonomically designed rear triggers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png"></figure><p>We'll update this article if and when we hear from 8BitDo about iPhone compatibility. Considering Apple has made a push into AAA gaming on iOS with titles such as Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and more, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller and its myriad customization features would be a boon for iPhone users.</p><p>Nevertheless, Android users have an exciting new controller option to look forward to. 8BitDo's controllers almost always punch above their price, so the 8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller should be on your radar. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CPY7H952?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Wireless 2.4GHz Wireless</a> is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controller in 2024</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Wireless Controller</a> is our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">favorite third-party controller for Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><p>At $50, 8BitDo's mobile controller is half the price of the Backbone One, the leading cradle-style mobile controller. Backbone One costs $100 and doesn't have rear triggers or Hall Effect sticks/triggers. It does offer dedicated support for iPhone and Android via USB-C (or Lightning), including a handy app that collects your games in one console-style launcher. The USB-C connection also mitigates latency concerns, whereas Bluetooth can add a bit of latency. 8BitDo's Bluetooth controllers typically work great via Bluetooth, but it's worth mentioning here.</p><p><strong>8BitDo:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (White)</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (Black)</a> -- $50</li></ul><p><strong>Backbone One:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_WCopub4HusdMMWHmtP?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2TJW4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lighting, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>In related news, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller is also available to preorder</a><span> now for $40 at Amazon.

As <em>Semafor</em> points out, the <em>Zorse</em> name “identifies the offspring of a zebra and another equine,” so it seems like the game will focus on wordplay like that.</p><p>Cohen says <em>Zorse</em> is currently only available in Canada, meaning I can’t play it myself.

            <p>The precision-platformer is a torturous genre at the best of times, and now developers Brlka and publishers Ysbryd Games have seen fit to combine it with Silent Hill. Their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/love-eternal">Love Eternal</a> is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".</p>
<p>When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Commendably harrowing, yes? Celeste meets Silent Hill is one framing - Gris but grimdark is another. I already know I'm going to struggle with the platforming, but I'm very curious about the setting, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a>'s bottomless sokoban-scape. I also like the treacherousness of the presentation, with larger animated sprites suddenly louring into view during the hop-and-bop sequences. I like it up to a point, anyway. If the game does the fourth-wall peekaboo routine every time I have to carry out six mid-air gravity flips in a row, I am going to get Cross.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of features from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gorgeous hand-drawn pixel art graphics bring the god's realm to life alongside meticulously handcrafted animations boasting many thousands of frames</p>
<p>A lush, atmospheric score, equal parts unsettling and beautiful</p>
<p>Responsive, snappy controls provide challenges with a sense of mastery and acrobatic accomplishment</p>
<p>A psychological horror narrative contorts and unfolds to reveal choices beyond comprehension</p></blockquote>
<p>Love Eternal is out in 2025. For pretty much the exact tonal opposite of this, may I recommend Ed's recent favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardust-demon-is-an-intergalactic-metroidvania-that-looks-very-snazzy-indeed-and-its-out-now">Stardust Demon</a>?

		<p><em>The shift to streaming means a shift to on-demand entertainment, an opportunity to watch, listen, or play what you want, when you want. We've spent all sorts of time at Remap talking about the luxury of entertainment and how we choose to spend our time, but one thing Rob and Patrick have in common, as any Remap reader knows, is sports. </em></p><p><em>The reason companies continue to pay so much for sports packages, and will continue to do so, is because it's event viewing. The moment a sporting event is over, it loses value. But appointment viewing is powerful, because it's a guarantee of putting butts in (virtual) seats. These days, that's rare.</em></p><p><em>If you were lucky enough to buy an early TiVo box, technology companies were using their power for good and completely eliminating ads from the viewing experience. Now, technology has been leveraged to ensure you're getting the most targeted, specific ads, none at all, or seemingly the same ad over and over.</em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick watch a lot of ads. And they have thoughts.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Okay Patrick, we’re a few weeks into the football season, we’ve had some great playoff baseball, the WNBA is wrapped and the NBA is getting rolling. Which means we have probably seen more TV commercials than we have in months and I have to ask… are there any you absolutely hate yet?</p><p>It’s not quite as bad right now as during the football playoffs or the NBA playoffs, where companies just go wild with their ad budgets and you start getting smothered by new campaigns. But I always find myself morbidly fascinated by the ads you see during major sports events, because they both tell you which companies are making so much money they can afford to just saturate the airwaves, and they tell you what those companies want to portray about themselves and your relationship to their product.</p><p>I think one of the darkest ads I see is the Eric Andre FanDuel ad?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA6gw3Lxjjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="More Hunches | FanDuel Sportsbook"></iframe></figure><p>This is basically just encouraging compulsive gambling, right? This dude is sitting down to enjoy the games except he’s not really watching the games, he’s getting constant intrusive thoughts about side-bets and parlays he could play the instant he gets the impulse because the FanDuel app is <em>right there </em>on his phone. Except it’s not scary or sinister because it’s just Eric Andre doing goofy little bits about each of the wagers he proposes. Wormtongue, but make it Millennial Comedy.</p><p>It also feels like it marks a bit of a shift since the gambling apps were first blanketing commercial breaks. We’re not showing Jamie Foxx leading you into the exclusive club that is the MGM sports book, telling you how much better the things you love can make you feel if you just lay a little wager on them. The “new user acquisition” phase of the online betting rollout appears to be ending, at least for FanDuel, so now you’re getting ads that are about increasing engagement. Which feels like a bad thing when we’re talking about betting! The ad isn’t even for anyone who is not already gambling pretty regularly: the guy is alone in his apartment, apparently friendless, sitting down to track all the games via Sunday Ticket while being haunted by ideas for other wagers he could place. I feel like if you’re thinking this way, you might already be in some trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet there he is, multiple times a game, thinking about how good it’d be to bet the fucking Broncos. Just in case it wasn’t already clear that they’re trying to micro-target people who love gambling and completely suck at it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kenny Eliason</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> C’mon, Rob. You’re telling me these exploitative ads are worse than No Flex Zone x Wingstop?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tj1FKGsLR9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Wingstop - No Flex Commercial ( Rae Sremmurd )"></iframe></figure><p>This ad literally started playing <em>while I was fucking writing this, </em>watching the opening of the NBA season.</p><p>I’ve been low stakes gambling on sports for the better part of 10 years. Before it was “legal” in my state, all you had to do was sign up for a website that could tap into a Las Vegas sportsbook—in my case, Bovada—and dump some money in. The UI wasn’t sexy, but it worked. For me, betting was a way to create more friction and investment while watching sports in the same vein as fantasy football, which I’ve been doing for more than 10 years. One of my leagues goes further back, with a group of friends from college. At one point, I was probably doing four fantasy football leagues at once? It’s helpful to have more than one going, in case you’re slammed with a bunch of injuries and your entire roster basically falls apart.</p><p>Those fantasy leagues? There’s an entry fee every year, one that’s gone up as we’ve gotten older.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is all to say there’s a running theme of wanting to stack additional tension while watching sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Gambling, like fantasy football, is a mixture of luck and skill. It’s mostly luck, but you can improve your odds by being smart. I find it fun, I don’t overspend, and my bets are usually a couple of bucks. A little money goes in, a little money comes out. I’ve never even exported my winnings to a bank account, because I just roll it over to the next season, or event. Winning a bunch of money isn’t even the point.</p><p>In the old days, though, betting itself had friction. You’re signing up for a weird website. It feels a little sketchy. Gambling itself had a stink on it—it was for degenerates and that one guy you know. Now, it’s branded as <em>cool</em>. FanDuel, man, is slick. I highly recommend downloading it and poking at the UI, because what you’re going to find is something pretty fucking gross. I cannot fathom how much they’ve spent on psychological studies to understand the different ways they tickle your brain to make you bet more, with all the fancy colors and splashy visuals tricks drawing your attention to different ways to spend your money.</p><p>I have rules. I have a process. I don’t have a problem. But if I didn’t? These apps are cruel boxes.&nbsp;</p>

Well, for starters, it’s because the game’s made entirely of pixel art, which doesn’t allow for much experimentation or sexualization…Or does it? Of <em>course</em> it does.<br></p><p>As it turns out, the modding community caters to everyone, including those who want a little more on-screen nudity or depravity in their indie farming sims. It wasn’t difficult to find the six thirstiest mods for <em>Stardew Valley</em>. It was more challenging to narrow the list down to just those we could show you.</p><p><strong>Be warned: This article contains sexually explicit and suggestive content.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pseudodiego / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s lewd, and then there’s downright nude. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xtardew Valley</a></span> opts for the latter by introducing adult-themed content into the pixel art farming sim. It includes additional relationship content for all bachelors and bachelorettes, along with a few of the townsfolk, and a big part of that is sex.<br></p><p>You can now have sex with nearly every romanceable female in the game, along with a few of the married women who were previously off limits, in a variety of strange locales, and positions. Occasionally, you’ll stumble on one of the iconic characters neck-deep in erotic situations, and we mean that literally and figuratively.</p><p>We recommend starting a new game with this one, as you may miss out on many of the unique scenes and heart events added to the game with Xtardew Valley. It somewhat broke my old save.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-recommend-id="image://193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A title card from the mod Yandere Haley Dialogue Expansion in Stardew Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A title card from the mod Yandere Haley Dialogue Expansion in Stardew Valley." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kxgarashii / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-recommend-id="image://193c92258751d17fc21e466578463702" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A title card from the mod Yandere Haley Dialogue Expansion in Stardew Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Thanks to anime’s influence, there are so many Dere types in the world, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s modding community is working overtime to implement them all.

They are jealous and possessive, and now you can enjoy that level of crazy in the game, with more than 170 new lines of dialogue, including pre-marriage, post-marriage, and festival scenes for Haley!</p><p>At one point, you’ll discover piles of photographs taken from outside the window of your farmhouse. It appears Haley likes to sneak around in the twilight hours, snapping photos of you at your most intimate moments. Oh, and don’t let her catch you with someone else. She has a few choice words should you start to get close to other characters, warning you of the consequences. All that said, it’s purely flavor dialogue for those who enjoy this personality type.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-recommend-id="image://8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Devious Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Devious Valley." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->undare / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-recommend-id="image://8a49234629295a4219668fbbe8b31a62" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Devious Valley." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s time for the gentlemen to get a touch-up in Devious Valley, which implements male-led romance and sexual encounters by introducing new characters, a frat house, a pool filled with urine, and plenty of welcoming bears.<br></p><p>Furthermore, as a male character, you’ll encounter additional dialogue and cutscenes with the townsfolk. If you raise your relationship high enough with, say, Alex, he might fiend for you with a certain hunger that his pants betray.</p><p>If that’s not enough and you want to implement a little kink into the mix, there are milking machines for each bachelor in the game, so that’s something to consider…I guess.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-recommend-id="image://ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Valley Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Valley Girls." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TrashRacc1124 / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-recommend-id="image://ae19e1fe89deb82533b13922cf1328c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Valley Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As most characters in <em>Stardew Valley</em> are grown ups, considering you can marry most of them, it only makes sense that they occasionally enjoy a horizontal refreshment as consenting adults.<br></p><p>With Valley Girls, every female now features a schedule in which they will wander off, find somewhere relatively secluded, and pleasure themselves—sometimes alone and sometimes with a partner. You can meet up for a thrilling romp in the backroom of Gus’ pub, for example, or in the locker room at the spa.</p><p>Be wary, however. In addition to pixel sprites getting it on, the mod features fully realized portraits of the game’s characters in all their morning glory. It’s downright not safe for work! But if that’s your cup of tea, I recommend visiting the beach occasionally. You’ll find Haley and Alex midway into a trip through the backdoor behind Elliot’s shack in the sand.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-recommend-id="image://8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nude Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nude Girls." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TrashRacc1124 / Concerned Ape</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-recommend-id="image://8cb07b40f8cbc1d84a809e53b3f7edcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nude Girls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some people swap out the character portraits in <em>Stardew Valley</em> with anime or period attire to fit a role-play they’re working through. Some, however, prefer lewd portraits, and that’s where Nude Girls enters the scene. It replaces the current sprites, portraits, and outfits for many of the game’s female characters. Once installed, they swap to nude versions, bearing everything in dialogue and out in the world.<br></p><p>It’s important to note this is purely a flavor mod. There are no significant additions or alterations to the gameplay; it simply swaps the women around with scantily-clad, often wholly naked sprites and portraits. Trying to read about a character’s hardships while she’s flashing you is a little distracting, but some players enjoy that!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-recommend-id="image://da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lustdew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lustdew Valley" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TrashRacc1124 / Concerned Ape</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-recommend-id="image://da1e8dd1908a0c2639b6475440dc7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lustdew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Thanks to mod author TrashRacc1124, Lustdew Valley works as an extension of Valley Girl by increasing the sexual occurrences across the Valley with new locations, objects, furniture, clothing, and cutscenes in due time. It’s essentially an overhaul that expands the game’s adult flavor significantly.<br></p><p>Lustdew Valley features a secretive bathroom entrance in the Valley Girls Bathroom, leading to new locations, interactive sex booths, gloryholes, and a completely new shop vendor with unique items, hats, and clothing. Of course, if you fancy yourself a connoisseur of a particular Czech-produced adult series, you’ll find the patrons of the new area to your liking.</p><p>By the way, there’s a new bundle to unlock, but it requires a handful of worn sex toys found throughout the bachelorettes’ rooms. I only saw the one for Haley and Emily since I tend to romance the former in my playthroughs.</p><p>Who knew the world of <em>Stardew Valley </em>modding could take such a turn? Anyone who’s been on the internet—that’s who.

            <p>
We've seen some unique approaches to arachnophobia modes in video games as they've started to become more common in recent years, but nothing quite like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s new approach. Activision's solution somehow makes everything even more horrifying, by robbing its zombie spiders of legs and turning them into something arguably worse.
</p>
<p>
"For the first time in Black Ops 6 Zombies, a new arachnophobia toggle feature will be available," Activision writes in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-accessibility-updates-features">post outlining Black Ops 6's new accessibility features</a> over on its blog. "This setting will allow players to change the appearance of spider-like enemies in Zombies without affecting their game play."
</p>
<p>
All of which sounds perfectly reasonable and good. After all, arachnophobia modes are far from unusual these days, even if their approaches are rarely the same. Developer Coffee Stain opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/finally-a-video-game-with-an-arachnophobia-mode">replace spiders with adorable pictures of cats</a> in Satisfactory, for instance, while Obsidian's Grounded - a game positively bursting with the things - let players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lethal-company-is-taking-a-novel-approach-with-its-new-arachnophobia-mode">dial the spider details all the way back</a> to 'innocuous circle'. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s solution, meanwhile, is a little more scorched-earth, simply <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-it-doesnt-have-a-single-spider">eradicating the game's spider population</a> entirely.

<p>
Black Ops 6 developer Treyarch's approach to the spider problem, however, is something else entirely, with the studio having seemingly taken Obsdian's 'floating blob' solution as a starting point by removing its zombie arachnids' legs and then, well, stopping there. Which would be fine if the end result - a sort of giant mutated shrimp? <em>Sperm?!</em> - wasn't somehow more upsetting. Still, at least the nightmares won't be spider nightmares, I guess?

Elsewhere in its post, Activision spotlights a couple of other interesting new accessibility features for the Call of Duty series, including asymmetrical hearing compensation settings - enabling players to create custom audio profiles and adjust separate settings for each ear. Which, speaking as someone who's had lop-sided hearing since a childhood run-in with a lake, is something I'd definitely love to see more games adopt!
</p><p>
Black Ops 6 also includes an expanded High Contrast mode designed to assist players with vision impairment or colour blindness by letting them toggle a 'dark background' setting or customise outline colours for allies and enemies. This, of course, proved to be a surprise for some players at launch after they switched on the game only to discover <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-your-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-characters-blue-make-sure-youve-disabled-high-contrast-mode">everyone was blue</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Black Ops 6 features what Activision is calling Intelligent Movement, intended to help players with mobility issues reduce inputs by minimising and customising button and stick processes. That's alongside new HUD customisation features, used to switch between layout pre-sets and adjust minimap colours, plus support for the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Sony Access Controller. It's also now possible to pause and save during solo Zombies matches.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass - and there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analysts-reckon-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-bring-up-to-4m-new-game-pass-subscribers">already plenty of chatter from analysts</a> about what its day one launch Game Pass launch will mean for the future of Microsoft's subscription service.

		<p>Three years after its release on PC, Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun Aiko´s Choice now has a release date for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, and that is December 6th. The game is now available to pre-order on both platforms, and comes with a 10% pre-order discount which will be available right up until release day.</p>

<p>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun Aiko´s Choice features Aiko as the main character as she tackles the spymaster Lady Chiyo and puts to rest her own past. Aiko is not the only playable character, as she is joined by Hayato, Mugen, Yuki, and Takuma. The game itself features three main missions and three shorter interlude missions. People will have the choice of three versions to order, and those are detailed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shadow Tactics:&nbsp;<span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice</strong>&nbsp;– Base Game: €17,99 until release (€19.99 at release)</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Tactics:&nbsp;<span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice – Deluxe Edition</strong>&nbsp;– Includes the&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice</em>&nbsp;Base Game +&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice Soundtrack</em>&nbsp;(featuring tracks from&nbsp;<em>Blades of the Shogun</em>): €22.49 until release (€24.99 at release)</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Tactics – Ultimate Bundle</strong>&nbsp;– Includes the&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice</em>&nbsp;Base Game +&nbsp;<em>Blades of the Shogun</em>&nbsp;Base Game +&nbsp;<em>Blades of the Shogun Artbook/Strategy Guide</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice Soundtrack</em>: €62.99 until release (€69.99 at release)</li>
</ul>

<p>In our Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun review, Miguel said, “<em>There aren’t many games like Shadow Tactics, and thankfully, it sets the bar high for any would-be challengers. The blend of RTS controls with stealth-oriented gameplay and level design create incredibly satisfying, almost puzzle-like encounters. It takes a lot of time and patience to be able to discover the solutions to these puzzles, however, and the hours long missions often left me feeling fatigued before I was even halfway through with them. Shadow Tactics is a unique exploration of the stealth genre with a great amount of polish, but if you’re going to dive in, be prepared for just how deep the water is.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have topped a big milestone on the very day of its launch.</p>

<p>According to a Sega press release (via <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-over-one-million-units-on-launch-day-r2660/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sonic Stadium</a>),&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has reached a million sales already, which is pretty impressive given the fact that the game was only released today.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that players who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game were granted three-day early access, so technically,&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has been available for a few days, but it was released to the general public today.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=eXTZORSY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=4yWT4R7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is already doing pretty brisk numbers for Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the press release, Sega attributes&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>' success to a worldwide marketing blitz, as well as the fact that the game supports 12 different languages and was released simultaneously around the world.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega says it's themed this fiscal year around Shadow, dubbing this initiative "Fearless: Year of Shadow". That makes sense, given that he'll be turning up as a pivotal character in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow">upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie</a> later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest 3D platformer in the long-running and iconic&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>series, and as you've probably guessed, it's themed around everyone's favorite edgy hedgehog Shadow.</p>

<p>The game consists of two parts: a full remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations</em>, complete with "updated visuals and reworked cinematics", and a new game that sees Shadow speeding through some of the levels from games in which he's appeared.</p>




<p>Shadow's campaign is technically a standalone game, so you don't need to play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>to enjoy it, but unfortunately, it's not possible to buy Shadow's campaign separately.</p>

<p><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9MVLZDH2FH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, I felt a feeling I hadn’t felt in a long while: I was looking forward to the release of a <em>Call of Duty </em>game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-everything-we-know-1851531121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-everything-we-know-1851531121"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a></span>, the latest installment in the long-running <em>Call of Duty </em>sub-series, has spent the last several months hyping up audiences about all of its changes and innovations, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800">its quickened pace and omnimovement</a></span>. Meanwhile, the promotional tour has <em>also </em>been deliberately trying to harken back to some kind of golden age for the franchise, which seems as embattled as ever despite still regularly posting huge numbers and breaking records year after year. In recent weeks, players have been excited over the return of systems like prestige, which I didn’t even realize had been stripped from the games, but my personal favorite bit of messaging has been around Zombies, a fan-favorite cooperative mode that has become a staple of <em>CoD </em>since it was first introduced in 2008.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,196909,195840" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Over the years, Zombies has grown from a throwaway game mode tossed into 2008’s <em>World at War </em>at the last minute<em> </em>into a full-fledged prong of <em>CoD</em>. It has featured unique maps, weaponry, mechanics, characters, and stories! It’s home to the weirder side of the otherwise milquetoast, standard-bearing franchise, making it a beloved fixture of the series. As the games ramped up in scale, though, Zombies did too, and eventually the mode became unwieldy and unfamiliar even to people who’d played it for a long while, but especially to folks like me who looked to it as a casual kind of third space to just drop in and out of with friends.<br></p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>, however, has continuously made promises that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cod-black-ops-6-blops-zombies-solo-features-leak-rounds-1851616861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cod-black-ops-6-blops-zombies-solo-features-leak-rounds-1851616861">its iteration of Zombies would be a kind of reset </a></span>for the mode. It would be a return to the most basic formula for the experience: kill zombies, rack up points, buy and upgrade cool perks and weapons, rinse and repeat. The mode would return to round-based progression, the maps wouldn’t be these labyrinthine sprawls—at least at first—and the developers promised that it would even simplify the storytelling of Zombies, which now includes numerous different crews of survivors scattered across several storylines. Though I can’t speak to every one of those promises, I did manage to load up Zombies on <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s launch night and play with the very friends I last fought alongside years ago, and if I may say, I loved just about every bit of it.<br></p><p>The key to my positive experience is that, for the first time in a long time, this <em>Call of Duty </em>mode didn’t feel so burdened. Make no mistake, there’s tons to know going into it, like the fact that you can make custom loadouts to start with, pick out Gobblegum perks that you can earn mid-match, and so on. But that did little to get in the way of my dropping into Liberty Falls—one of <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s two Zombies maps at launch—with my friends, buying wall guns, and kiting swarms of zombies in circular routes before picking them off.<br></p><p>The lengthy game that I played gave me a chance to familiarize myself with both the map, a small Americana-style town, and the cadence of the rounds. <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s Zombies still features the occasional special round composed of a different enemy type—this time spiders, to the chagrin of arachnophobes the world over. A part of me really missed the Zombies announcer’s “Fetch me their souls!” from the good old days of hellhound rounds, but I can make peace with the fact that some things must change.<br></p><p>To that end, this new Zombies experience isn’t without <em>some</em> innovation. Armor plates are now in Zombies, carrying over from <em>Warzone</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>’s battle royale title, and drop from enemies. Salvage does as well, and can be put to use at crafting tables around the map to make armor, equipment like grenades, or upgrades to your weapon’s rarity and base damage. There are pickups that allow you to even mutate into special zombie enemy types, and maps have their own wonder weapons, rather than a univeral pool. Points are no longer distributed by hit but by kill—a change I <em>don’t </em>love, especially as enemies become more spongey in later rounds and points risk becoming a scarcity—and there is no longer reinforcement of barriers and windows, which could stagger the release of enemies and stop rounds from devolving into open mayhem right away.<br></p><p>The biggest change, at least for me as someone who last played these games around <em>Black Ops 3</em>, was in the composition of the zombie ranks. New maps and iterations of Zombies have long featured some kind of central gimmick or even boss character, like George Romero in Call of the Dead, the prison warden in Mob of the Dead, and even Avogadro in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-dutys-most-hated-zombies-map-should-make-a-come-1847066627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-dutys-most-hated-zombies-map-should-make-a-come-1847066627">Tranzit</a></span>, but in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, waves of enemies look vastly different than I’m used to. There’s a mixture of armored and standard zombies, which will push players to higher-damage builds more quickly, but alongside spiders (which can also spawn from dying zombies), there are also mini-bosses that will periodically appear and then outright overwhelm you in the late-game rounds. Manglers are heavily armored brutes who fire homing concussive blasts, while these three-headed beasts called Abominations shoot electricity from any of their maws, and command the field the second they appear.<br></p><p>Many of these changes are welcome additions, and ones I reckon have been around for a while, but most importantly, none of it ever got in the way of the classic high of pursuing a lengthy run and shooting the shit with friends. There’s a lot of optional depth and profundity to Zombies in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, but it is, in its purest form, a blast, and that hasn’t felt true in a long while. I’m looking forward not only to sampling the other Zombies experience available in the base game—a much moodier map called Terminus—but to growing comfortable with old and new strategies alike and settling into familiar grooves. While I can’t speak for the whole package just yet, as far as Zombies goes, we are so fucking back.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The original text has been restored in full, along with select visuals.

We bring some of the best stories from TV and film and make episodic “story” games from them. We do our own licensing, design, development, publishing, and marketing, all under the same roof. We also tend to make product decisions together as a studio. We are independent, but bigger than “indie.” All of this brings a very unique set of challenges with it, which makes this postmortem a bit different as well. At Telltale, working with external partners and figuring out what “playing a story” means is just as important as slinging DMA packets around and writing code that controls what each CPU core is doing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We want to make games that let people immerse themselves within an actual role in stories like they never have before. We’ve had a fair bit of success in attracting some well-known licenses, but our roots are in graphic novels, reaching all the way back to Sam &amp; Max and Bone. We were thrilled at the opportunity to tackle something as rich as The Walking Dead and work with Robert Kirkman. By now, our series has won more than 80 Game of the Year awards and has been widely recognized as a groundbreaking achievement in the industry, but it certainly wasn’t an overnight success!</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went right">What went right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Partnering with Skybound">Partnering with Skybound</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In early 2011 we reached out to The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman and his production company Skybound to discuss adapting his award-winning comics into a Telltale series. We were not going to pitch a game that was about killing zombies. Instead, we were going to pitch an episodic “story game” that focused on the thing we felt made his books so compelling: normal people adapting to impossible situations. The game we pitched was focused on dialogue and character development, and was to be incredibly cinematic and seriously emotional. We wanted people to connect with the characters and role-play like they never had before. There were certainly much more obvious takes on a zombie genre game, which made us a little nervous. Our pitch was probably not what they were expecting. Luckily, they were familiar with some of our previous work, so they took the meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we met with Robert and the other folks at Skybound, they were very impressed by our vision of what a Walking Dead game could be. They understood how such an approach, if successful, would capture a much deeper sense of what made the comics so successful. Most importantly, they saw a special opportunity and were willing to take this risk with us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, Robert Kirkman and everyone else at Skybound were (and are!) amazing partners. Even as the television show was becoming a runaway hit, they always made time to ensure we had the feedback and support we needed. One of the best things Robert did early on was introduce us to his friend Gary Whitta (screenwriter of Book of Eli and After Earth). Robert trusts Gary, and Gary really understands what makes The Walking Dead unique and special. Consequentially, Gary joined the team relatively early as our story consultant. As a gamer himself (he was editor-in-chief of PC Gamer for many years), his integration was easy and his impact immediate, making valuable contributions to the season story and design. Gary helped push us further toward the darker and more dramatically difficult aspects of The Walking Dead. When considering some of the trickier or more heart-wrenching parts of the story, such as letting the player choose to kill Duck or not, Gary would often be the one evangelizing the “you have to let the player go there” angle. Eventually, he dove in even deeper and wrote the script for the fourth episode.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Learning from past projects">Learning from past projects</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many game companies “reset” at the end of a project. They choose to start a new engine, or pursue a new game mechanic or control system, and choose to tackle completely new problems. At Telltale, we intentionally evolve our processes and technology without resetting them. We carefully take what has worked in the past and add layers to it instead of reinventing it. The same tools used to create </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can still load and play the entire Telltale catalog.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Telltale has always aspired to make our unique experiences truly compete with more traditional genres such as FPSs and RPGs. Over the years, with each series, we’ve challenged ourselves to make “playing stories” more compelling and push the envelope as to what it means to “play a story.” In addition to the fundamental writing and design tasks, each series has tried to tackle specific aspects of this larger agenda. We’ve had some great successes and a lot of lessons learned along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Very early on with Sam &amp; Max, we were simply figuring out the formidable challenges involved in designing, producing, and publishing digital adventure games on an episodic schedule. Later, with a series like Wallace &amp; Gromit, we challenged ourselves to move past traditional “point and click” and embrace the console controller. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Strong Bad’s Cool Game For Attractive People</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the first regularly scheduled episodic game ever simultaneously released on consoles and PCs. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Poker Night At The Inventory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had characters dynamically telling jokes and stories while reacting to the player and the cards. It also introduced our first online features with its unlockable </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Team Fortress 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> items. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back to the Future</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enabled us to examine how to make our games less obtuse and more accessible, reaching wider audiences and more platforms. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jurassic Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we experimented with alternate control schemes and playable characters, and tried making fast-paced action sequences. Most importantly, we learned ways to keep the pacing of the story moving along while staying interactive and keeping the player engaged. Along the way, each series allowed us to refine our episodic production pipeline and tools, and become a much more significant (and successful!) self-publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve never been content to be a boutique game developer/publisher. In innumerable ways, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the result of eight years of continuous exploration and evolution. This process not only informed us while creating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it also gave us the confidence to take the even more ambitious risks you see in the finished game, such as…</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The “No Good Choice” game mechanic">The “No Good Choice” game mechanic</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going in, we knew that in The Walking Dead you’d be confronted with awful choices, not much time to consider those choices, and then have to deal with the fallout of those choices. We did spend some time exploring integrating choice into more traditional game mechanics, but things didn’t start to really gel until we decided to go “all in” on choice. As a studio, we wholly embraced the idea that the game would allow narrative opportunities if they were plausible to the player. However, it wasn’t a simulation: We would still be handcrafting the “spine” of the story, and if a narrative option seemed plausible within that context, we committed ourselves to letting the player explore it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great example of this is a critical moment in the third episode. One member of your party, a woman named Lilly, suddenly and deliberately shoots another member of your party, ostensibly to ensure the ultimate safety of everyone. The initial idea for this section of the game was that zombies would then immediately drive the group back into their RV, which would force the player to deal with Lilly’s actions in those close, inescapable quarters. As the details of that interaction came into focus, it became clear how strongly we felt about the idea of abandoning her at that moment. This was a moment we simply had to allow the story to play out both ways (she stays or she goes). We felt that empowering the player in critical moments like this was far more satisfying than giving a blanket good or evil ranking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also discovered that smaller, more intimate details often worked much better for us than giant, sweeping, branching opportunities. For instance, it’s often more interesting to let the player slight or insult NPCs than it is to let the player outright steal all their belongings or completely betray them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes there were great initial story ideas, but they included some plausible choices that didn’t lead to interesting places. For example, in episode two, we really wanted different characters (not just Mark) to end up as the St. Johns’ victim depending on how you played, but when we explored allowing him to play a more significant role, and even perhaps survive, he just wasn’t adding anything good to the story. He became a sort of vestigial story problem in an otherwise really good part of the game. In these cases, we had to punt. Often though, we would keep working until we had moments where all possibilities were compelling and producible. It was most exciting when we created moments where all possibilities felt equally compelling and intriguing. These made the choice taken and the choice not taken just as important to the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games have certainly explored choice and branching narrative before, though most of those games have used player choice as a subset of a larger gameplay mechanic. They typically had rather binary player choices such as good or evil, light side or dark side, etc. which in turn drove various AI and NPC systems. We felt strongly that a statistics-driven AI and NPC system would not be able to deliver the kind of experience we envisioned. Instead, our system tracks every choice a player makes at a very detailed level and then makes that information available to designers. They use that information to create narrative-driven logic that controls the content and subsequent choices that are offered to the player. Our version of choice isn’t emergent from a system, but a carefully crafted bespoke experience driven by narrative possibility. This is what we mean by “tailored narrative.”</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Episode directors make everyone a storyteller">Episode directors make everyone a storyteller</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beginning with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jurassic Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we introduced the idea of individual episode directors. An episode director is akin to the film director of a movie. They work very closely with the writers, designers, and production departments to craft a vision of how the episode will unfold for the player. The director chooses the combination of narrative tools that are used to create each moment in the finished game. Their job is to leverage lighting, color, music, sound effects, composition, pacing, and contrast to make the best interactive experience they can, and then they have to communicate and drive that vision through to the completion of the episode. Having someone dedicated to interpreting the script and design of each episode in this way encourages everyone to approach their work from a narrative context first. It transforms everyone in the studio into a storyteller.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this model, sound designers aren’t simply creating a room ambience anymore; they are contributing to a beat in a story in conjunction with their director. A modeler is creating environments for specific moments instead of generic simulations. Lighting setups change over the course of the episode based on narrative structure instead of the simple ticking of a clock. The artistic process isn’t driven by a simulation anymore, and instead serves the narrative context the player will experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The episode director isn’t a position at Telltale; it’s a role that is filled based on each episode’s unique circumstance, and a director needs to have passion for the license, the characters, the script, and the interactivity. We have opened this role to anyone in the studio, from any discipline, so long as they have a clear vision for what their episode will be, and the support and confidence of the team to execute it. So far, we’ve had directors come from writing, design, art, programming, and cinematics. (We haven’t yet had any directors from marketing or finance, but the door is open!)</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Bringing players together">Bringing players together</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are deliberately no right or wrong choices in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We didn’t set out to make a game you could win or lose. We wanted to expose difficult and interesting possibilities to players and reward them whatever they chose, while still leaving the choices not taken as a lingering possibility. The path not chosen should feel as important as the one they did choose. For instance, there is an opportunity to steal food from a stranger’s car in the second episode. Some might choose to steal the food in order to survive; others might view that as a loss of one’s humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted to enable the player to see where they stood compared to the rest of the world. So, at the end of each episode of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we presented a statistics screen that shows five critical decisions the player made, and how their choices compared to other players. Exposing this to players transformed a single-player experience into a platform for social commentary, and encouraged players to discuss their motivations and experiences with each other. It also encouraged players to reconsider their choices and try replaying the episode from a different perspective. Although </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn’t a multiplayer game in the traditional sense, it certainly inspires a lot of conversations between friends and communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to the five stats displayed at the end of each episode, the game also tracked dozens of other decisions players made. We were able to use this to help us understand what types of decisions were most interesting to players and reinforce those moments in subsequent episodes. In fact, at the end of episode four, we added an additional statistics screen showing what combination of survivors were joining you for episode five, and how your group compared to everyone else playing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating a compelling narrative “possibility space” for a player is significantly more rewarding when players are able to see the bounds of that space and compare their place in that space with their family and friends.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went wrong">What went wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Casting is hard">Casting is hard</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Casting has always been tricky for us, and as we keep ratcheting up the drama in our games, the bar for our actors keeps rising as well. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had particularly tricky casting challenges. Our leading characters were a southern black professor and an eight-year-old girl, in addition to a large and diverse supporting cast. They certainly were not your typical video game fodder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had so many auditions that were more caricature than character. Of the actors who were able walk the line between too generic and overly stereotyped, there were few voices that matched the way we imagined our characters. Of the few actors left that we did like, many of them were unavailable, too far away, or over our budget.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We initially cast the voice of the main character, Lee, from this compromised field, and proceeded to record the first episode. When we got the first group of lines back, we knew we were in trouble. Lee just didn’t have the range and personality that the game demanded, and now we had a large production team waiting instead of implementing. We needed a new Lee, and fast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, one of our cinematic artists suggested an actor he was a fan of: the eminently talented Dave Fennoy. We tracked him down, and he was able to quickly get us an audition. Once we heard him, we knew he was what we needed. Dave is not only a fantastic voice talent, but an amazing actor who created a Lee that was much more nuanced and dynamic than we had hoped. Dave gave us confidence and allowed us to push the character of Lee even further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Clementine, the eight-year-old girl who is with you throughout the game, was also a casting challenge. She is not a precocious stereotyped kid, but a smart young lady who is desperately trying to make sense of a world turned upside down. Finding any adult actress to voice a young girl is challenging, but finding one that could portray a complex character like Clementine was especially difficult. We went through another arduous casting process before finding the amazing Melissa Hutchinson.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Stranger, the ultimate villain at the end of the game, was also particularly difficult to cast. We needed the character to have a kind of quiet insanity. Once again, we cast and fully recorded what turned out to be the wrong actor. Literally the night before the schedule required we start recording, we found Anthony Lam—the creepy, quiet insane voice we were looking for. Fortunately, he was able to record immediately the following day. Those lines were being fed into the game as fast as they were recorded.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need to get better at casting. As our games are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and dramatic, they are requiring more diverse and skilled actors. Fortunately, for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we were mostly able to find the great actors we required in time, but just barely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenge of defining and communicating the essence of our characters in ways that provide talented actors the tools they need in a game context has proven to be a daunting and difficult task. Our actors rarely get to perform with one another—we usually record their parts individually—which makes it hard to offer them context or insights into their character’s motivation. Also, we’re finding that directing the performances during the actual recording sessions is itself a specialized skill set that we need to improve.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Remaking episode two">Remaking episode two</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we were focusing intently on episode one, episode two was quietly coming to life in the background on its own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we went “all in” on choice, it changed how episode one became fun and engaging. As these things were changing, we were iterating at what seemed like light speed, tweaking interfaces and adding features like “choice notifications,” onscreen inventory, panic meters, and more. We were intensely critical of everything, and we were finding fantastic new ways to make choice compelling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we finally got episode one to a good place, episode two had already been written, recorded, and was partially into production. When we were able to compare episode one and two, they felt radically different. Episode one had all this really cool new stuff that wasn’t being exploited in episode two, and episode two felt kind of “old Telltale” by comparison. So we decided we just couldn’t move forward with the version of episode two we had.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We gathered a large group of writers, designers, producers, and directors offsite at a local hotel conference room and spent two days hammering out a new direction for the episode that exploited and even advanced everything that was feeling so great about episode one. Though some large elements such as locations, principal characters, and story beats remained, nearly all of the dialogue needed to be rewritten and then rerecorded. We were super enthused by the new design, but we were already behind schedule, leading to…</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Massive schedule compression">Massive schedule compression</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a monthly episodic game company, the schedule is king and constantly looms over everything we do. Just imagine if you tuned in for the last episode of The Sopranos and there was a screen saying “Sorry, we didn’t get it done. Come back later!” All the recasting and retooling that happened early in the series took a lot more time than we had anticipated. By the time episode one really came together, our series launch date was upon us, and as they say, the show must go on! Episode one launched with a much better reception than we could have dreamed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, now we were further behind schedule than we had ever been before. To make matters worse, we had a huge rewrite of episode two to complete before we could restart production on it. While the new episode two script was completed at breakneck speed and recorded as quickly as possible, we considered what could be done to get back on track. We ended up basically putting nearly everyone in the studio onto the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have always been a multi-project studio, so we’ve never really had everyone working on the same game at the same time, and figuring out how to best divide production responsibilities among such a large group was tricky. We broke the action sections of the game (such as the zombie attacks) out into their own strike teams, while a different group owned the dialogue-driven parts. All in all, the studio quickly turned out some amazing content, but we were still weeks behind on episode two, and our schedule was still getting stretched out as far as it possibly could.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, episode two ended up in customer’s hands nine weeks after episode one was released. Though this was an amazingly short time given the circumstances, customers were understandably anxious, and didn’t hesitate to let us know it. Our forums and Facebook pages were swarmed with people demanding their episode, and we didn’t do an adequate job of communicating what was happening.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By keeping the whole studio focused on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we were able to make up most of the time. We wrapped the series just a few weeks short of its originally planned completion date.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Backend servers and DLC">Backend servers and DLC</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first game in which each episode was delivered as DLC instead of individual executables. This required a new “in-app” store, new content licensing code, and new download managers. That’s a lot of “new,” and furthermore, each platform had its own unique DLC quirks and complexities. iOS even required us to implement our own content delivery network! DLC also presented an entirely new QA process from simply staging content on partner networks, installing and uninstalling individual episodes, and controlling the licensing status of content on all our test accounts. We had a lot to learn about DLC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to DLC, the game was also the first to send telemetry back to the Telltale servers so we could present the choice statistics at the end of the episode. We created a new REST API specifically to handle this data, which required new code both on the web servers and in the game engine itself. Both of these changes were substantial, and they ended up being a lot of work to bite off with an important title like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we felt that the game would suffer significantly without these features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we launched, the game was incredibly well received, and our servers were quickly overwhelmed with the volume of hits they were receiving. When the servers stopped responding to the game, it would cause noticeable delays at the Press Start screen and at some save points during the episode. For the first few days, we actually ended up throwing incoming data away and serving a stock reply while we frantically brought more servers online.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On Xbox and PlayStation, the system handled the download of new episodes for us, but on iOS, the application also had to download the content for the user. This required a download manager, which turned out to have many more problems in the real world than we anticipated. Mobile devices tend to have significantly more network connection problems than PCs or consoles, and we just weren’t able to simulate the wide array of real-world circumstances we would encounter. Unfortunately this meant that too many iOS players had to suffer with us as we pored through our server logs, download code, and test cases to finally get the download manager as robust as it needed to be.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Bugs, bugs, bugs">Bugs, bugs, bugs</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Between the compressed schedule, the new DLC model, and the work required to launch on many platforms, we ended up with a lot of bugs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The worst of these was related to our save game “rewind” system, which allowed the user to rewind the story an earlier point in the game. Since most of the episodes didn’t exist when the system was implemented, we didn’t have the test cases required to ferret out the edge cases that occurred in the real world. Unfortunately, that meant that some players lost their save data and had to replay the game from the beginning, which is about the worst thing that can happen to a player in a choicebased episodic game. Another bug caused the “generate random choices” dialogue to appear when in fact no random choices needed to be generated, which just made the players who were anxious about losing their save data even more worried.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, each platform had its individual list of bugs, as well as the usual permutations of hardware-specific PC bugs, which made it very difficult for us to communicate solutions to the player. We found that many angry customers had to navigate a complex maze of information to find their solution. Even the best-intentioned users often ended up advising other users with solutions that worked in their context, but might be disastrous in another context. For example, some users would “tweak” their data to recover a save game, and other users might try a similar strategy, but end up destroying their save data. Obviously the root of the problem is the buggy system itself, as users should never have needed to attempt any of these things in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though we’ve aggressively patched these issues and resolved most of them, you can’t really unring a bell. There are still small content bugs left in the game, and players are too often left with an impression that the game is buggy. All we can do at this point is continue to patch, and take what we’ve learned from this experience to ensure bugs like this don’t happen in the future.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Walking Devs">The Walking Devs</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the last eight years, Telltale has been manically committed to the idea that interacting with characters and stories could be some of the best game experiences ever. We’re convinced that stories are not just for cutscenes—stories can be the game themselves. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is our example of the state of the art, but we’re confident that we can make playing a story even more compelling. We’ve also been equally committed to episodic games, smaller games, and cheaper games. And now we’ve built a studio that has matured to the point of being able to create a Game of the Year while staying true to these goals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately for us, it looks like we’ll have an opportunity to continue exploring the space. Our game based on DC Comics’s Fables is well under way, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a second season in the works, and many new properties are seeking out Telltale in hope of working with us to make a game.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie has acknowledged it is "investigating a potential issue within [its] code for how RNG perks are generated" despite previously assuring players there was "no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2".</p>
<p>For the last week or so, Destiny 2 fans have been debating if the "god roll" for its latest grenade launcher, VS Chill Inhibitor - "Envious Arsenal" and "Bait and Switch" - was being throttled. Despite both perks falling on other weapons with relative frequency, the chance of getting VS Chill Inhibitor with both perks was vanishingly slim, making some think Bungie was intentionally tipping the RNG scale to ensure this roll dropped very, <em>very</em> infrequently.</p>
<p>Cue "Weightgate".</p>

<p>At first, Bungie was clear: "Hey all, we had a conversation with our Sandbox folks this morning about this. There is no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2," the Destiny support team <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232">insisted</a> on X/Twitter.</p>
<p>"We have added perk attunement for Exotic Class Items in a recent update, but that's a different system."</p>
<p>The issue, however, becomes impossible to ignore when you look at the stats on sites like <a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/1762785662/vs-chill-inhibitor/?p=,,,,,0,0">light.gg</a>, a database that scrapes weapon perks from player inventories (cheers, <a href="http://v/">PC Gamer</a>).</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a few days later Bungie posted to X/Twitter "regarding further reports of perk weighting", saying that whilst it has "confirmed that there is no intentional perk weighting on weapons within our content setup", it acknowledged that something was up, and was "now investigating a potential issue within our code for how RNG perks are generated".</p>
<p>"Many thanks to all players who have been contributing to data collection across the community. This data has been monumentally helpful with our investigation, and we are currently working on internal simulations to confirm your findings," the team said.</p> <div>
