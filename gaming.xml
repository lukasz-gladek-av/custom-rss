			<p>Today, Hazelight Studios announced that their highly anticipated new adventure game Split Fiction will be playable through crossplay across all platforms. This greatly enhances any player's ability to play with their friends since Split Fiction, like Hazelight's prior games, is co-op only.</p>
<p>But there's more. While the studio's previous games also implemented free passes for friends, enticing a casual gamer to play with a more hardcore gamer who bought the game, this time there's an evolution of that.</p>
<p>Through the Friend's Pass Trial, even if neither player owns a copy of Split Fiction, they can still experience a trial version using the Friend's Pass. Once they both download and launch the Friend's Pass version of the game, they will unlock the opportunity to invite each other to play the opening stages of the game together. If they like the game, they can progress if just one of them purchases a full copy of the game, which will be priced at $49.99 when it launches on March 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | How to Invite a Friend for Free with the Friend's Pass" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Josef Fares and his team garnered widespread acclaim, especially with their latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won several Game of the Year awards. Split Fiction is also about a duo, although a very different one.</p>
<p>This time, players will step into the roles of Mio and Zoe. They're both writers, although one writes sci-fi, and the other fantasy, and they have wildly different personalities. They both find themselves trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. Relying on each other to escape with their memories intact, they work together to master a variety of skills and overcome various challenges as they jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in what Hazelight promises will be an unexpected tale of friendship. The full PC system requirements for Split Fiction are available below.</p>

Rockstar is also adding FSR1, FSR3, and DLSS3 upscaling, as well as faster loading times via SSD and DirectStorage. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/franklin-and-lamar-headline-gta-online-update-red-dead-1848354289&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/franklin-and-lamar-headline-gta-online-update-red-dead-1848354289"><em>GTA V</em></a></span> on PC will support DualSense controllers and those fancy adaptive triggers too, after the update arrives in March.

Oh, and PC players can now subscribe to <em>GTA+,</em> Rockstar’s subscription service that provides various bonuses and free games. </p><h2 id="h5087"><a id=""></a>There will now be two PC ports of <em>GTA V</em></h2><p>Rockstar confirmed that PC players who upgrade will get a free one time character transfer option. The company is promising to update and support both versions of<em> GTA V</em> on PC, so people who can’t run the new version or who have lots of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678">mods</a></span> for don’t have to upgrade anytime soon. </p><p>Now, here’s the catch, because there is always a catch: if you upgrade the PC version of <em>GTA V </em>and transfer your<em> GTA Online </em>character, you won’t be able to play with people who haven’t upgraded yet.</p><p>“Please note that to maintain this support, the original version of <em>GTA Online</em> on PC will be a separate instance, and players who remain on that version will not be able to play in sessions together with those on the upgraded version,” explained Rockstar. “PC Players who want to play with each other will need to ensure they’re playing the same version of the game.” </p><p>Rockstar says both versions  will be available to everyone on PC, even first-time buyers, so you’ll always be able to play with your friends. It just might mean you need to have two versions of the game installed depending on who you are playing with, which sounds kind of silly even if I understand why.</p><p>Regardless of that hang-up, its nice to see Rockstar Games finally getting around to updating the PC port of<em> GTA V</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">even if we are likely less than a year away from the release of <em>GTA 6</em></a></span>. That game won’t be out on PC at launch anyway, so I guess PC players can enjoy a better version of <em>GTA V</em> while they wait for the inevitable port. Let’s hope it doesn’t take three years. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the launch of <em>Among Us 3D</em>, the VR version will be rebranded, and the new release will unite players across both PC and VR through cross-play.</p><p>The studio says that this “will allow Steam PC users to join cross-platform lobbies with VR players on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO.”</p><p>It’s not clear yet when the 3D game will be launching, but the studio says that it’s coming soon on Steam. A demo will be available as part of Steam Next Fest on Monday. And while the original 2D version of <em>Among Us</em> will still exist, there will be no cross-play between it and the first-person edition.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Innersloth also revealed a new in-game currency called “stardust,” which will be used to buy cosmetics in <em>Among Us 3D</em>. The studio specified that the currency won’t be used for purchasing any actual game modes or features.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/chip-n-clawz-vs-the-brainioids-is-a-co-op-rts-with-chaotic-overcooked-energy-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Brain vs. Claw-n</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you even play it, you can intuit a whole lot about the upcoming action-strategy game Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, just by its absolutely ridiculous name alone. Well, I’m pleased to report that after spending several hours with it, it’s exactly as goofy and over-the-top as the title suggests. This cartoonish co-op adventure gives off a distinct Saturday-morning cartoon vibe with its bright colors, absurd gags, and dorky aliens with wacky voices, and blends 3rd-person action with real-time strategy elements that have really piqued my interest. But don’t be fooled by its family friendly ornamentation! As one might expect from a strategy game with XCOM creator Julian Gollop at the helm, this thing already started to show just how deceptively challenging it can be during my short time with it, which has left me eager to see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids threw me right into the middle of the action without much context behind its completely bonkers premise – and I was extremely okay with that. I mean, what’s not to get about a reckless human named Chip and a robot kitten named Clawz, fighting against an alien race of brains inside jars called the Brainioids? My co-op friend and I worked our way through increasingly tricky levels filled with relentless alien baddies sent to kill us by someone named General Blobbius (who is not a military general, but the general manager of the Brainioids corporation, because of course he is). If you couldn’t tell already, Chip ‘N Clawz doesn’t exactly take itself seriously, to its enormous benefit. From the brightly-colored levels, dopey looking enemies, and ongoing childish banter, it immediately oozes a kid-friendly charm that lured me into a false sense of security that maybe this would be a pretty easy ride, even though I’d selected hard mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Chip ‘N Clawz vs. The Brainioids - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our objective was the same for most levels: battle our way through alien hordes and destroy the mothership at the far end of the map using a legion of robotic minions as our allies. To do so, we have to work together to collect Brainium (the resource used for building) and make decisions about what to spend it on, whether that be the construction of new factories or to power up individual units so they’re more effective in combat. But what started out as a fairly by-the-numbers action game with light RTS components became more complex with each level, until we found ourselves screaming at the screen and at each other in a panic, as we were overwhelmed by the enemy on multiple fronts. That’s because Chip ‘n Clawz definitely knows what it’s doing in the real-time strategy department, and in between the time I spent running around the map bonking aliens about with my melee weapon, I was toggling over to the build and command modes, which allowed me to construct new facilities or order my minions around, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are loads of things to consider, as Chip ‘n Clawz slowly introduces new factories to build, units to control, and upgrades to apply to your character’s loadout that modify your abilities. You might, for example, want to take a perk that upgrades all your mining units that gather resources for building so that they’re faster and can withstand more damage from the enemy, or you might instead prefer to just deal more damage with your own melee weapons if you prefer to do more of your own dirty work. Then, during a certain level you might decide to spend your resources on a new artillery depot that supplies your character with a long-range gun, or alternatively you could use that Brainium to construct some stationary turrets to fend off enemies in the area automatically.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’re introduced to more and more things to consider, the enemy quickly levels up their tactics as well, which spirals into some surprisingly formidable encounters. One level had me defending our mobile base from enemy attack on three different fronts while controlling dozens of units, while another required me to construct vehicles and jetpacks to reach far away areas in search of resources I needed to win the day. The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series, which uses its seemingly simple mechanics and cheery art to disguise the friendships it will surely ruin in the coming hours. Similarly, Chip ‘n Clawz cleverly disguises its difficulty by being one of the most immediately approachable RTS games I’ve played, luring you into a false sense of security with its third-person action mechanics, but then hilariously kicks you in the face with demanding levels that require you to lean more and more into its complicated RTS mechanics a short time later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like I’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg from this surprisingly deep strategy game, and am looking forward to seeing how crazy things can get in later levels.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/amazon-not-google-reportedly-buying-twitch-for-1-billion/">Amazon-owned</a> game streaming platform Twitch <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announced Wednesday</a> that it will be imposing a 100-hour limit on the archived video highlights users can preserve permanently on the site. And while Twitch says that only 0.5 percent of users will be affected by these new limits, gamers are warning that the move threatens to eradicate large swaths of recent gaming history from the Internet.</p>
<p>Highlights, in Twitch's own words, are a way for Twitch streamers to "show off your best moments to new viewers who land on your channel page." Unlike VOD recordings of full Twitch broadcasts—which are deleted automatically after seven days (or 60 days for Twitch partners)—these highlights provide a more permanent way to maintain an archive of important moments for many Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>That seeming permanence is set to end on April 29, though, when Twitch says it will start to delete content from channels with more than 100 hours of highlights, starting with the least-viewed highlights.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announcing the change</a>, Twitch cited the "costly" indefinite storage of these highlights, which it says are responsible for "less than 0.1% of hours watched" across the site. These highlights "haven't been very effective in driving discovery or engagement with viewers," Twitch wrote, and limiting them will "help us manage resources more efficiently... and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed."</p>
<h2>An “incalculable” loss</h2>
<p>On social media, though, many Twitch users are expressing outrage over what the loss of these clips will do to the shared history of their gaming communities. "Who the hell cares about discovery or engagement?" one streamer <a href="https://x.com/MrJimmysteel25/status/1892421085418643523">wrote</a>. "People use highlights to archive, and you're destroying YEARS of speedrunning and other communities' history."</p>
<p>The speedrunning community seems particularly likely to be negatively affected by Twitch's move. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">VTuber</a> VanityFox <a href="https://x.com/VanityyFox/status/1892588675306815995">points out</a>, "many speedrunners use highlights to document world records and important moments... the amount gaming history they are deleting to save money and shove short form content on your feed is incalculable."</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/gta-v-on-pc-gets-the-ps5-xsxs-upgrade-for-free-in-march/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-v-on-pc-gets-the-ps5-xsx-s-upgrade-for-free-in-march.1114680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/gta-v-on-pc-gets-the-ps5-xsxs-upgrade-for-free-in-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rockstar has announced that Grand Theft Auto V on PC is getting a free upgrade, rolling in all the enhancements that were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/04/gta-v-and-gta-online-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date-set-for-15th-march/">made for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S back in 2022</a>. This includes new vehicles at Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, improved graphics, faster load times and more.</p>
<p>The free upgrade will available from 4th March 2025.</p>


<p>Instead of just being a patch to download, this will be a new version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-v">GTA V</a>, and though it will be dished out for free, it will come with a one-time character migration for story and online, and will not be backward compatible for play between versions.</p>
<p>That’s… quite odd, though can be pinned on the increased system requirements for graphical changes. It’s also quite odd that Rockstar are getting round to this now, three years after the same upgrade came to consoles. At the very least, they’re not trying to double-dip on this for PC, considering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/08/gta-5-online-ps5-cheap-upgrade-pre-load-character-save-migration-xbox-series-x/">the triple-dip that console players saw</a>!</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from Rockstar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoy a range of new vehicles and upgrades at Hao’s Special Works (HSW) that push automotive performance to new heights, and test your driving skills with Premium Test Rides, HSW Races, and HSW Time Trials.</li>
<li>Encounter Ambient Animals all across Southern San Andreas and take pictures of them to participate in the daily Wildlife Photography Challenge for new rewards.</li>
<li>PC players can sign up for GTA+ Membership to get special benefits in the upgraded version of <em>GTA Online</em> and beyond.</li>
<li>Track your criminal movements across all of <em>GTA Online</em>’s updates with the Career Progress feature as you build your empire.</li>
<li>Navigate a refreshed Landing Page as your starting destination to get straight into the action. Plus, take advantage of an improved introductory flow for newer players with a GTA$4,000,000 windfall to buy property, vehicles, and other items as you start off as an Executive, Gunrunner, Nightclub Owner or Biker in the Career Builder.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the technical side of things, there’s also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing features only available on PC such as ambient occlusion and global illumination — plus ray traced shadows and reflections first debuted on consoles</li>
<li>Support for AMD FSR1 and FSR3, and NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why this is an optional upgrade is that the minimum requirements have increased. In particular on the GPU side of things, you’re jumping forward to the GeForce 1630 and Radeon 6400, compared to the GeForce 9800 GT 1GB / AMD HD 4870 1GB. You also need to run the game from an SSD.</p>

<p>One final oddity, this is all happening less than a year before the expected launch of GTA 6. Take Two has repeatedly affirmed that GTA 6 is expected to launch in late 2025, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">since stating this release window last May</a>. That release is only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though, with Rockstar always preferring to turn to the PC after the consoles. Recent reports have suggested that GTA 6 could come to PC in early 2026, but we’ll just have to wait and see on that.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tony-hawk%E2%80%99s-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease.1114674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The signs pointing to the next Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game continue to find their way out, this time via a tease in a different Activision game.  </p>



<p>Spotted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Grind map, there is a skateboard area with a logo similar to that of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skate 1 + 2. Within that logo reads a date: March 4, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Coincidently, if you go by month-date-year formatting, the month and day equates to 3-4, the expected next remaster from the classic skateboarding series. </p>



<p>The latest tease comes just days after pro skater&nbsp;Tyshawn Jones said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview</a> that a new game was “about to come out”. It was then followed up with claims from eXtas1s that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/">be shadow dropped</a> when it launches.</p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2—a remaster of the first two games—launched in 2020. That game was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022. There were talks that the follow up remaster was in development, but that it had been cancelled sometime in 2021-2022. In September 2024, however, Hawk himself said that there would be a future for the franchise as it celebrated its 25th Anniversary and that it was something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was excited about</a>.</p>



<p>“I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future,” Hawk said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an Instagram post</a>.</p>



<p>Do you think the announcement of the next Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game will happen on March 4? Or do you think it’s something different? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
One of my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-selection-box-edwins-bonus-games-of-the-year-2024">Xmas selection box games</a> last year was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-rooms">Withering Rooms</a>, a delightfully frightful haunted house action-RPG that balances mazey Metroidvania level design with the ability to be a witch who can supersize herself and gallop around on suits of magic armour. With a quick glance over my shoulder at our dear friend Sir Eugene Optimisation, I dare to describe it as a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, if Bloodborne had been made by a tiny independent developer. 
</p>
<p>
Also rather Bloodborney: the recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-realms">Withering Realms</a>, a sequel of sorts in which you play a ghost girl clinging to the back of a customisable combat doll. Sir Eugene Optimisation requests I add here that the doll conceit reminds him of well-received Soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a>. Which is a fair observation, I think, though I would also say the doll’s lipless, one-eyed grimace reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>. How’s that, Eugene – three for three? Anyway, here’s a trailer.

<p>
As the title suggests, the key change here from Withering Rooms is that you’re no longer confined to a single house and grounds. Instead, you’ll get to “explore the mysterious town of Penwyll and the sprawling graveyards, tombs, caves and rotting estates that surround it”, with combat now unfolding on a full 3D plane. The year is 1926, but not as you may recall it if you happen to be 100 years old. In Withering Realms, the first World War was interrupted by an occult event which has caused the dead to walk and spirits to roam. It’s also given certain people the ability to cast spells.
</p>
<p>
The ghost girl is Clover, who died during the above occult event. She’s able to interact with the world only through the doll, which can thankfully be outfitted with a range of bludgeoning, carving or shooting implements, including a “pivoting greatsword” and a “chain rock”. The doll aside, Clover has an ally in “daring freelance investigator” Althea - one of the few other characters who can see her.
</p>
<p>
I still need to finish Withering Rooms but this looks like more of what I enjoyed about that game. There are some involved-sounding overworld mechanics: you can “expand the world map by defeating massive perimeter guardians”, and return to areas at night “to encounter new, horrifying creatures and secrets”.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-nascar-25-career-mode-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>IRacing is deep in development of its first NASCAR console game, NASCAR  25, and it has released a new developer diary going over some of the features of the game’s career mode.</p>



<p>The diary first talks about the previous announcement that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-25-to-feature-four-official-series-including-arca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arca series is coming</a> to a console game for the first time. The series will  be available in career and other modes throughout NASCAR 25.</p>



<p>“So, why having Arca, Trucks, Xfinity and Cup is so important, especially from a design perspective, is we finally get to do what is a realistic career mode that somebody would actually follow in real life,” Director of Development and Production John Schneider said. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the NASCAR 25 career mode, there will be opportunities to grow your driver’s brand off the track and spend your time. Players will be able to build their reputation by helping clean up a park, helping around the shop, or even have a part in a movie. Your sponsors might also have tasks for you that will help keep you in their good graces. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NASCAR '25 Dev Diary: Ep 03" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKZeypm3tIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“You’ll have to balance between building your reputation and your brand, and being successful on the race track,” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said.</p>



<p>There will even be decisions on how you spend your money to improve your team and become a top contender in every series you enter. According to Mike Devault, the game’s UX lead, designing the career mode was a “herculean effort”.</p>



<p>“You want to make sure that you have all the right details in there about what makes a NASCAR career really authentic,” he said. “At the same time, you don’t want to make everybody have to go through all the minutia of managing a race team and the finances and the employees.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“It’s a nice balance, and I think we’ve pulled this off really well in NASCAR 25 where if you want to just concentrate as being a driver, you can do that while mildly being involved in some of the decision making. But, if you want to go in there and manage every last little detail, you’re going to be able to do that as well.”</p>



<p>Devault added that throughout the career, interactions between driver, crew chief, and team will feel more authentic as opposed to being too much “like a UI screen.”</p>



<p>NASCAR 25 launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty's big new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-2-reloaded-patch-notes-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update/2900-6273/" data-ref-id="2900-6273">Season 2 Reloaded update</a> is out now, and fans quickly discovered that one of the maps added to Black Ops 6 appears to point to a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater reveal soon.</p><p>The Grind map, which takes place at a skatepark, includes a banner that says "03.04.25" with the iconic Pro Skater logo above. Assuming it's styled for America, this would point to March 4, 2025. Exactly what could happen on that day, however, is unknown. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">previously reported that a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remaster would launch this summer</a>, and if that's true, then March 4 could be when the game is revealed or at least teased further. </p><p>Tony Hawk himself <a href="https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">chimed in about the tease with the eyes emoji</a>, suggesting this is indeed real and some kind of announcement is forthcoming.</p><p>The Grind multiplayer map first debuted in 2012's Black Ops 2. A remastered version is out now as part of the Season 2 Reloaded update with a fresh coat of paint and this apparent THPS teaser.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6’s Grind MP map!<br>Announcement on March 4. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In other skateboarding news, the Season 2 Reloaded update adds a new melee weapon in the form of a skateboard that you can whack someone over the head with to take them down with one hit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447186"></a><figcaption>Smack your enemies with a skateboard in Black Ops 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg"></figure><p>Recently, real-life pro skater <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-tony-hawk-remaster-on-the-way-pro-skater-claims/1100-6529542/" data-ref-id="1100-6529542">Tyshawn Jones claimed that he was in an upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> game even though Activision had not announced a new one yet.

                <p>Funcom has announced that its MMO survival game, Dune: Awakening, will launch for PC on May 20. The game is also slated for a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S launch, but a release date for those versions hasn't been revealed yet.</p><p>In this iteration of the Dune universe, the main protagonist Paul Atreides was never born. Players assume the role of a prisoner sent to Arrakis to uncover the mystery around the Fremen's disappearance. Along the journey, players will rise from being a nameless survivor to either becoming an agent of the Atreides or the Harkonnen.</p><p>The game will cost $50 and those who preorder will receive a decoration called the Terrarium of Muad'Dib that they can place in their bases.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl6Wi20fSp0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can also download the character creator and benchmark tool to receive a special code to redeem a Frameblade Knife at launch. Characters can be saved and imported to the full game, and the benchmark tool lets players know if their hardware can run it. While Funcom hasn't revealed the full specification requirements, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> notes that it requires a 64-bit processor and operating system at least.</p><p>Dune: Awakening features an ever-changing open-world desert that shifts every week, and players can explore new locations and rewards. There will be server-wide politics in the form of Landsraad decrees, where every player will be impacted whether they're aligned with Altreidas or Harkonnen.</p><p>While the game is multiplayer, players can choose to experience the storyline alone, and PvP is always optional. Players can also sign up for the beta on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">game's official website</a>.</p><p>Dune: Awakening's unique world will also have players being able to team up with characters who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-mmo-will-let-players-team-up-with-characters-who-are-dead-in-the-book/1100-6511909/" data-ref-id="1100-6511909">are dead in the book series</a>, and Funcom is "rethinking" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-rethinking-survival-game-staples-according-to-new-interview/1100-6511865/" data-ref-id="1100-6511865">survival game mechanics</a> and staples with this game.</p>
