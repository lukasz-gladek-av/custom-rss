For example, the boon Family Trade, which granted a boon of higher rarity upon the sacrifice of one you already had, is no longer in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-tips-beginner-start-1851459493&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-tips-beginner-start-1851459493"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span>. Instead, it’s been replaced by a brand new boon called Rousing Reception, which allows your cast to cause damage to enemies as they enter an encounter. </p><p>A Daedalus Hammer upgrade to the Sister Blades has also been snuffed from the game, which is a bit of a blow. The upgrade, known as Escalating Ambush, would grant a bonus to the Sister Blades’ Omega Attack after using the technique to successfully kill an enemy. Considering the popularity of Escalating Ambush builds, the upgrade’s removal is definitely hurting fans of the Sister Blades.</p><p>Funnily enough, though, not only did the Sister Blades get a buff to their backstab damage, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769">Chronos’ behavior</a></span> in his boss fight has been adjusted to make it easier to stab him in the back. Before, his sequencing of moves made him a bit of a pain in the ass to get behind, meaning it was difficult, if not impossible, to score backstabs, which enjoy a significant damage multiplier, on him. Now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-phase-2-build-boons-twin-wands-1851504444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-phase-2-build-boons-twin-wands-1851504444">the fucker should go down</a></span> more readily as long as you can sneak up on him.</p><p>Otherwise, there have been some balance changes to encourage more build variety. Of particular note is the Golden Rule boon, which got a nerf of sorts. Golden Rule, which granted a flat damage bonus to your attack and special moves based on how much gold you had, now has a lesser multiplicative damage modifier on all types of damage. In essence, you shouldn’t be able to two-shot bosses based on how wealthy you are anymore.</p><p>Here are the entirety of the latest <em>Hades 2</em> patch notes:</p><h2 id="h269110"><a id=""></a>Aspects of the Nocturnal Arms</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Sister Blades (Melinoë): increased damage striking foes from behind</li></ul><h2 id="h269111"><a id=""></a>Boons &amp; Blessings</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lightning Lance (Zeus): improved targeting while using gamepad controls</li><li>Spirit Surge (Zeus): reworked; now whenever you use magick, a surrounding foe is struck by lightning</li><li>Sworn Strike (Hera): slightly reduced bonus from Poms of Power</li><li>Engagement Ring (Hera): reworked; inflicts Hitch on foes, and any slain in the circle deal area damage</li><li>Family Trade (Hera): cut from game; replaced with…</li><li>Rousing Reception (Hera): new!

<p>Activision has announced full details of Season 5 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone, and with <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-5-essential-maps-modes-zombies-announcement#WWE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it came confirmation</a> of the WWE collaboration for the game.</p>



<p>Coming to the game as operators are WWE stars Cody Rhodes, Rey Mysterio, and Rhea Ripley. Both Rhodes and Mysterio are available as part of two WWE-themed bundles for the game.</p>



<p>The two bundles are as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Tracer Pack: WWE – Cody Rhodes:</strong> Includes the “American Nightmare” Operator Skin plus two stars and stripes-themed Weapon Blueprints, a Weapon Charm, Weapon Sticker, Large Decal, Loading Screen, and the “Cross Rhodes” Finishing Move.</p>



<p><strong>Tracer Pack: WWE — Rey Mysterio:</strong> Includes “The Ultimate Underdog” Operator Skin plus two red and black Weapon Blueprints and a Weapon Charm, Weapon Sticker, Large Decal, Loading Screen, and the “Mysterio Bulldog” Finishing Move.</p>



<p>It appears as though Ripley will just be a skin to purchase as opposed to a full bundle. She will have two skins to choose from as part of the Season 5 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>More details on the bundles will be available starting July 23.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is getting a big new Worlds update which treats the space sim's gazillions of planets to a sumptuous overhaul, using technology devised for stablemate fantasy sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, which only has one planet, albeit a "literally Earth-sized" one with dragons. Catch a deep dive trailer for the Worlds update below.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The Worlds update introduces water features that boast ripples, foam and reflections, clouds that form and disintegrate in real-time, and weather effects such as rolling fog, rain and blizzards - all of them sculpted by a revised wind system. Skies have more colours, iceworlds boast shinier glaciers, and deserts have more diverse vegetation. They've also gussied up the lighting so that objects, from trees to clouds, cast shadows in relation to the sun's position.

<p>
Sparkling ambient flourishes aside, the update brings new solar ships, aka space sailboats, the possibility of sentient walking houses on weirder planets, and a host of new creatures for the menagerie. "We want to do things that people haven't seen before," explains studio boss Sean Murray in a release, bathetically adding "and of course, these new creatures can all be pets and mounts". The Worlds update also introduces a new Expedition, which features a flamethrower-wielding mech, and is "Starship Troopers inspired" - I suspect it also owes something to the recent popularity of a certain squad-based democracy management game. 
</p>
<p>The update also makes a few improvements to performance. "Rendering of environmental objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been moved to a GPU-based system, allowing for denser worlds with increased performance," explains <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/">the full changelog</a>. "Planetary flora, minerals and curiosities have improved levels of detail from further distances and a broader range of angles. Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, increasing loading speed, improving framerate and saving memory."</p>
<p>There’s a lot more through the jump, including details of new cosmetics and underwater base fixtures, though beware that the patch notes are an absolute landslide of autoplaying videos. My laptop began to hyperventilate when I tried scrolling all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p>
"Six months ago we announced Light No Fire," Murray comments in the press release. "It's this insanely ambitious game. Over the last five years making game, we've learnt new things, and we're feeding that back into No Man's Sky. It feels like we're bringing technology back from the future!" If you'd like to know more about Light No Fire, Hello <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-studio-hello-games-unveil-light-no-fire-a-fantasy-survival-game-set-on-a-single-huge-planet">invited me down to see it a few months back</a>. I personally am a huge fan of the kingfishers.

<p>EA Sports has released its first trailer along with the reveal of the features coming to EA Sports FC 25 this year.</p>



<p>Returning to the game this year are Manager and Player Career Modes as well as Clubs. New for this year is the long-rumored, now confirmed 5v5 Rush mode. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/features/rush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mode is available</a> within Football Ultimate Team (FUT), Clubs, Kick-Off, and Manager Career.</p>



<p>Also new in EA FC 25 is FC IQ, which EA Sports calls an “overhaul of tactical foundations”.</p>



<p>“An overhaul of tactical foundations across the game delivers greater strategic control and more realistic collective movement at the team level, while a new AI model, powered by real-world data, influences player tactics through all-new Player Roles,” EA Sports says.</p>



<p>Within Career mode, there will be a post-launch update that introduces Live Start Points that allows you to “live out the biggest storylines from the real world”. More details on that will come at a later date.</p>



<p>EA Sports FC 25 releases for everyone on September 27 for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Those who buy the Ultimate Edition of the game will get access starting September 20.</p>



<p>For those wondering, the HyperMotionV technology within EA Sports FC 25 is only available on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Those on last-gen consoles and the Nintendo Switch will continue to get the last-gen version of the game.</p>

But it has been heavily criticized for its ultra aggressive monetization, which includes the cost of Ultimate versions of its playable characters, called Descendants.</p><p>The grind associated with unlocking Ultimate Descendants without paying money is immense, as players face some extreme drop rates for essential items, but that hasn’t stopped players from giving it a good go. One player, however, has taken the grind to extreme levels, putting in 200 hours over the course of just a few weeks to unlock all the Ultimate Descendants. That is, on average, 14 hours of playtime a day.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1e4r116/every_ultimate_descendant_unlocked_without/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor chicha112</a> showcased their eye-opening achievement with a number of screenshots and an impromptu ‘ask me anything’ of sorts as The First Descendant players reacted in disbelief.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/17/tfd-1721230903759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Chicha112 / reddit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Chicha112, who plays on PC, explained that they are a veteran of Warframe, a looter shooter from which The First Descendant takes inspiration, as well as Korean MMOs in general (Nexon is a Korean developer). Then it was just a matter of “raw grinding.”</p><p>“There's a lot of questions in the whole thread that I have tried to answer, but honestly when it comes to tips, it just comes down to making sure you're strong enough to tackle the content efficiently and then grinding it out,” Chicha112 said. “No special tricks or super tips to get ahead as far as I know.”</p><p>“A lot of these systems aren't surprising and I like to do things efficiently,” Chicha112 explained. “I also do just have a lot of free time ATM so I am lucky to be able to grind so much.”</p><p>“My playtime is 200 hours, I'm pretty sure I have some AFK time because of the maintenance day two and leaving the game on. I'm sure it’s a bit late for others, but a good tip to keep in mind is having a good foundation to grind these characters is very important. Having a strong weapon and a decently built character lowers the farming time by a lot! For example, I used my first energy capacitor and a couple crystallization catalysts on my base non-Ultimate Bunny while I was going through the game very early on to minimize my time spent.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot of these systems aren't surprising and I like to do things efficiently. I also do just have a lot of free time ATM so I am lucky to be able to grind so much.</p></div><p>Chicha112 did admit they had to buy character slots (yet another part of The First Descendant that is sold for real-world money) to house the Ultimate Descendants they’d unlocked. “Hoping they add a way to obtain them for free,” they added.</p><p>Some players have recommended Chicha112 now take a break from the game, which it sounds like they intend to do. “I’m all tapped out of sanity,” they said. "Yes it's time to touch some grass."</p><p>What does this tell us about The First Descendant and its grind? Nothing we didn't already know. This is a free-to-play game from Nexon, and so the grind to unlock coveted virtual items for the game's characters was always going to be punishing. But at least now the community knows the true time value of the money they're spending, should they choose to splash out on all the Ultimate Descendants in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Somewhat related, this week <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-asks-players-to-stop-afk-farming-please">Nexon asked The First Descendant community to stop AFK farming</a>, or going AFK during co-op missions, after it became a big problem soon after launch. Nexon was also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story"><u>accused of copying Destiny 2 icons</u></a> for the icons used in The First Descendant, something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations"><u>the company has now said it will address in-game</u></a>.</p><p>Last week, Nexon released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does"><u>a significant update for The First Descendant</u></a> that makes some big changes to the game, but leaves some aspects that had become a topic of discussion within the community well alone.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review"><u>The First Descendant review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Series director Masayoshi Yokoyama said he'll make that game one day, but it won't be the next title.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p>While RGG also develops <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-review">the Super Monkey Ball series</a> alongside a handful of other more random games, it's inarguably most known for the Like a Dragon series (as Ryu Ga Gotoku literally means Like a Dragon) so the studio drumming up interest already likely points to a more mainline reveal.</p><p>That being said, it has suggested fans will be "surprised" by its next game, essentially meaning anything is possible. Like a Dragon has many offshoots itself, so a ninth (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">technically 10th thanks to prequel Yakuza 0</a>) mainline game isn't the only option.</p><p>RGG has previously referred to spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a> as the "first" Gaiden game, for example, and it could even remake PlayStation Portable and Japanese-only games Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku Shinshō for modern platforms like it did with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-ishin-review">Like a Dragon: Ishin</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It has full spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/judgment-review">Judgement</a> waiting in the wings too, its still action heavy but more murder mystery, detective focused series which hasn't seen a new release since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lost-judgment-review">Lost Judgement</a> arrived in 2021.</p><p>It could also be something completely new altogether, though even this would seemingly follow a similar template or at least be set in Japan. As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-casting-audition-finalists-for-new-title-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, a public casting competition for RGG's next game is seeking a "Minato-style girl." Minato is an area of Tokyo but "Minato girl" specifically is slang used to describe a well off young woman.</p><p>Fans will just have to wait and see what the next RGG game is, but thankfully the reveal isn't too far away. The franchise's 20th anniversary takes place in 2025, and as RGG released the beloved Yakuza 0 as a special 10th anniversary project, it may be looking to do something just as grandiose next year.</p><p>Though this seems a particularly quick turnaround for a studio that just released its last mainline (and massive) game earlier in 2024, RGG is known for launching myriad games in a short period of time.</p><p>In the last five years, for example, it's released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgement Remastered, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5: 12 games in total.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the latest</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Amazon Games is bringing free-to-play Korean MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a> to the West in September, and we now know all the ways the publisher is changing the game's business model to better fit the expectations of western players.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/tl-business-model" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Throne and Liberty website, Amazon and developer NCSOFT outlined how the game's monetization will differ from the Korean version, explaining its goals, the main currencies players will be interacting with, and detailing how its five-day paid early access period will work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTA16Vhgzss" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HTA16Vhgzss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For starters, one of Amazon's stated goals is to make combat and power upgrades accessible to all players, not just ones who pay real money to get ahead. To further that mission statement, its in-game store won't sell one of the game's core currencies used to craft and upgrade gear, nor will it sell potions or food that may give players who have them an advantage. Quests and rewards exclusive to the paid battle pass will be removed. An optional subscription seen in the Korean version of the MMO that grants players various benefits, the Blessing of Solisium, won't be available (at least at launch), as Amazon is continuing to "evaluate how this offering needs to change to serve the needs of our players."</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes coming with the western release of Throne and Liberty include a reduction in price for both its premium battle pass and leveling pass. Both will be purchasable with a currency earnable from in-game activities or selling items on the auction house called Lucent, instead of real-world money. The battle pass has been upgraded too, with additional cosmetics and an improved final reward for those who do decide to purchase the premium version. That aligns with one of Amazon's other stated goals for the game's monetization model: The idea that purchasing items from the shop should feel rewarding but not necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty will offer a Early Access Pack prior to the game's launch that will let owners begin playing five days early, causing concern among some players that those who spend money will gain a noticeable headstart and advantage in Throne and Liberty's PvP-heavy endgame over those who opt to wait. To address those concerns, Amazon announced Throne and Liberty will launch with early access servers. All players who purchase early access will start on those servers, and players who join on the free-to-play launch date will have the option of picking new launch servers or joining an existing early access server should they so choose. Those who purchase early access will not be able to transfer a character from an early access server to a launch server for a period of time to ensure fairness, and the auction houses for early access servers and launch servers will not be connected.</p><p dir="ltr">More details about Throne and Liberty's early access offering will come alongside the game's open beta, which will run from July 18-23. Throne and Liberty is set to release on PC and current generation consoles on September 17 or September 12 for those who purchase early access.</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty won't be Amazon's only MMO releasing this year.

                <p>Just over a year after the Barbie film hit theaters, the pink girlie girl is getting a brand-new video game on consoles and PC. In Barbie Project Friendship, you play as both Barbie "Malibu" Roberts and Barbie "Brooklyn" Roberts as they try to save the run-down Malibu Waves Community Center. You can play the entire game solo or with a friend in local co-op.</p><p>In Project Friendship, you'll remodel and explore the community center: cleaning out storage, fixing lights, decorating the space, and more. As you play, you'll unlock outfits and furniture to customize your look. There are also a variety of minigames, including an Overcooked-inspired restaurant rush, bike and scooter repair, tennis, skateboarding, playing guitar, and making ice cream with Ken.</p>

            <p>
Sega has revealed it's taken legal action against a social media user for harassing one of its employees, warning that it will continue to pursue legal remedies or criminal proceedings should similar occurrences happen in the future.
</p>
<p>
The company - which published a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/customer_harassment_policy/">Consumer Harassment Policy</a> last year - reiterated its stance on social media harassment in a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/240717_1.html">post on its Japanese website</a>. Providing context, it explained it has been dealing with an individual who has made "excessive slanderous and insulting comments on social media against one of our employees" for a "long time".
</p>
<p>
After the individual failed to improve their behaviour, Sega continued, the company was granted access to the person's information through the court. Since then, it's reached a settlement, with the individual agreeing to "pay damages to our employee, delete the slanderous and insulting comments, and refrain from such actions in the future."

<p>
Sega adds it will take similar measures against anyone that breaks its Customer Harassment Policy in the future. "We consider slanderous acts against employees, such as announcements of violent acts, threats, and intimidation, to be serious human rights issues that damage the dignity of employees and lead to a deterioration of the work environment", it writes.
</p>
<p>
"We do not tolerate any harassing behaviour," it cotinues, "and in order to respect all employees and protect their human rights, we will continue to take appropriate action based on our Customer Harassment Policy when we judge any behaviour to be malicious." It then suggests customers familiarise themselves with its harassment policy and "refrain from any behaviour that damages the dignity of employees."
</p>
<p>
Sega's announcement comes as the harassment of games industry employees by players continues to be a concern. A survey of 2,300 attendees at last year's Game Developer Conference <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/majority-of-game-devs-see-harassment-from-players-as-major-problem-survey-claims">revealed</a> 91 percent of respondents believed player harassment and toxicity towards developers was an issue, while 42 percent felt it was a "very serious" issue. 40 percent of developers surveyed had experienced harassment themselves, with women, non-binary people, and members of the LGBT+ community most likely to be targets.

When you find a new species, you go into an observation stage to pick out all of its unique aspects, after which you will have to match it to its descriptor and name in your trusty notebook. </p><p>Once the tutorial is finished, large swathes of the map open up. The overarching goal is to catalog every creature and track down your aunt’s lost whistles. Each whistle is associated with a specific family of animals and lets you charm them. Once charmed, they become part of your flock, meaning they will follow you around wherever you fly, so you gradually accumulate a personal menagerie full of dazzling colors.</p><figure id="" data-id="f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-recommend-id="image://f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures on birds soar through a colorful landscape with creatures following behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two figures on birds soar through a colorful landscape with creatures following behind" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-recommend-id="image://f83ebe336f967ce8693c699a71aea265" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures on birds soar through a colorful landscape with creatures following behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s talk about that menagerie, as the creatures are the main event of <em>Flock</em>. The game’s color palette, apparent in the landscapes but most evident in the creature design, is incredibly bright and varied. Each species is something between a fish and a bird. Some creatures have clear and direct real-world inspirations, such as the eel-like Piper family, but others are more varied and fantastical. Even when creatures are part of the same family, however, they have their own colors and small embellishments. To stick with the Pipers, one is a simple purple while another looks like a rainbow snake toy you might use to entertain a cat. Cataloging the game’s species simply requires you to observe, and that instruction might be the most important part of <em>Flock</em>. It’s all about observing the beauty on display. You can also play the game with friends in co-op, though I’ve only explored solo so far.<br></p><p>The fluid flying creates a flow-state-like experience. Without the need to control the altitude at which you fly, moving around becomes an intuitive push forward into new areas, each with their own gorgeous landscapes and species to discover. By the time you’re flying around with a posse of creatures behind you, it might become clear that this game is a spiritual successor to 2014’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hohokum-the-kotaku-review-1619997976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hohokum-the-kotaku-review-1619997976"><em>Hohokum</em></a></span>. That’s intentional, as both games are from the minds of Ricky Hagget and Richard Hogg. While the cataloging and whistle collecting of <em>Flock</em> is far more structured than the <em>Hohokum</em>, both instill the same sense of calm. </p><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421108/hohokum-is-a-whimsical-and-soothing-game-about-exploration-and&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421108/hohokum-is-a-whimsical-and-soothing-game-about-exploration-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em></a></span> preview for <em>Hohokum</em>, Hogg said that the game was “about relaxing in a space and just enjoying the experience and the music.” That is the same ethos behind <em>Flock</em>. It’s all about going where your curiosity takes you and enjoying whatever you discover on that journey. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Football fever has been at its peak this summer, as the entertaining league seasons fed into the not quite as exciting Euros and Copa America. As is always the case with an international-filled summer, we’ve only got a short break before the 2024/25 season kicks off, and that means a new EA Sports FC game nears release as well. I had the chance to play some of EA Sports FC 25, which featured the UEFA Champions League Kick Off mode, and the new Rush mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBM2xyco_Kg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The EA FC 25 closed beta had seven teams to choose from men’s and women’s football across both modes. Those were both the men’s and women’s Real Madrid and Chelsea teams, Manchester City men’s team, Liverpool men’s team, Athletico Madrid men’s team, Liverpool men’s team, and the women’s Olympique Lyonnais team. As you would expect, each has their strengths with Real Madrid and Manchester City having the best stats, though every team has its key players.</p>


<p>To make those players stand out, FC 25 sees the return of playstyles from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a>. These are attributes that enhance specific elements of a player’s skillset, with key players having elite playstyles. For example, Valverde has Rapid+ which gives him a higher sprint speed when dribbling, and reduces the chances of making mistakes when sprinting or performing knock ons. Another player with an elite playstyle is De Bruyne, with his Incisive Pass+, which makes through passes more accurate, gives his swerve passes maximum curve, and precision passes that travel at top speed towards their target.</p>


<p>While the game has been enhanced with a new FC IQ to manage player tactics,&nbsp;EA FC 25’s main on the pitch action feels very similar to its predecessor. Much of the matches condense around the midfield with occasional bursts through the centre and the wings to either get a shot on goal, or fire a cross in. Goals do feel easy to score, with none of my matches played being a 0-0 draw. This was playing the game on Professional difficulty. Getting the ball into the box for and cutting back a pass to another player almost always guarantees a goal. Worldies are harder to pull off, but in one match I managed to replicate Bellingham’s overhead kick that he scored against Slovakia.</p>
<p>For the full game, there’s a few marquee changes built around the core on pitch action. The career mode will let you dive into women’s football for the first time, giving parity to the men’s game across all modes, and there’s also a new Live Start Points feature that will take real world scenarios and put you in control after the mid-season transfer window or managerial changes, for example. Reckon you can survive the fight at the bottom of a league?</p>

<p>The mode that could really ignite the excitement for EA FC 25 is Rush mode, in what is a fresh take on five-a-side football and the Volta mode of recent years, with two teams of five players playing. This can be single player with AI teammates, or with four other players with an AI goalie. Where a proper match can at times feel slow, Rush mode is fast paced and end-to-end, feeling more like a basketball game as teams rapidly go back and forth trying to score.</p>
<p>Now, some of you may remember the blue card controversy from earlier this year. FIFA proposed introducing a blue card that would send players to a sin bin temporarily for certain infractions for a limited time, before being allowed back on the pitch. While that idea was dropped in reality, the blue card is present in Rush mode. If a player gets blue carded, they are sent off leaving their team at a disadvantage, but only for a period of time. There is no way around it, as Rush mode does not have substitutes either.</p>

<p>Rush mode will not just be a standalone playable mode either, with it being confirmed that it will be part of Ultimate Team. Just like standard Ultimate Team, players will be able to build a five player team to compete in FUT Rush. It’s also integrated into Manager Career, giving you control over a team’s Youth Academy development with 5v5 tournaments to take part in.</p>
<p>While the closed beta only gave a small look at what to expect with FC 25, the general impression is a little mixed. The main game feels more of the same from FC 24, with the on the pitch action not being too different. It is Rush mode that really gives some fresh breath of life (more so than the name change) to the series, and I think it will be incredibly popular for all players due to how entertaining and quick it is.</p>

            <p>If DICE's Battlefield series lacks for one feature, it's surely the option to dig trenches. Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a>. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.</p>
<p>Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/over-the-top-ww1">Over The Top WW1</a> instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.</p>

<p>Over The Top WW1 is a historical multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> from the peeps behind the fairly well-received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358710/Battle_Cry_of_Freedom/">Battle Cry Of Freedom</a>. It pits up to 200 people or bots against each other in either prefabricated or customisable combat scenarios, on either "hand-crafted" maps (there are "over 12") or randomly generated terrain. You can also make your own maps in the editor, which seems pretty full-featured, and thrills with the prospect of custom map files a "few megabytes" in size. If I can fit those map files on a floppy disc, this is an automatic Bestest Best.</p>
<p>Also promising: the directional melee combat, which takes inspiration from Mount &amp; Blade, and the dynamic weather effects, which include visibility-lowering fog, ballistics-altering wind, and lightning storms that can bring down trees.</p>
<p>You may enlist as one of four classes: Infantry, who get flamethrowers, light machineguns and bolt-action rifles; Artillery, who lurk in the backrow dealing death by cowardly indirect means; Specialists, aka, engineers, who get to dig trenches and erect defences such as bunkers; and Tankers, who get to drive such mighty primordial vehicles as the British Mark IV or the "agile yet potent" Renault FT-17.</p>
<p>Convinced? You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778610/Over_The_Top_WWI/">read more on Steam</a>. Unconvinced? I'll fetch my shovel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/17/nintendo-is-raising-the-famicom-detective-club-series-from-the-dead-with-emio-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ">this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week</a>. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.</p>

<p>Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHBtMQaj7w0">a video featuring series producer&nbsp;Yoshio Sakamoto</a>, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.</p>

<p>"In&nbsp;Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.</p>

<p>Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.</p>
