The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroscape-returns-to-retail-by-renegade-game-studios">recently revived</a> board game has received new updates and expansions before, including the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroquest-rise-of-dread-moon-breathes-new-life-into-30-year-old-game"><em>Rise of the Dread Moon</em></a>. This new expansion, HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak continues that active support.</p>

<h2>The HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak Pre-order announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> brings players into the dense jungle surrounding the mountains at World's Edge. In this jungle, an ancient dwarven civilization has found new roots. But a sacred artifact held in Kellar's Keep, prized by the dwarven refugees, has been stolen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heroquest-jungles-of-dethrak-box-set-up.jpg?itok=Y59qGFPc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heroquest-jungles-of-dethrak-box-set-up.jpg?itok=vtPIYMmw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to jump back in?</figcaption></figure><p>Because of this, a blight has infected the jungle to its roots. As a powerful Berserker or Explorer hero, players will traverse the jungles and discover the vile secrets within. But all may be lost if the truth behind this land and its past are not uncovered.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> expansion will contain 16 new quests. Those quests will include a new choose-your-own-adventure mechanic where players can choose different paths leading to different endings. While other co-op board games have branching narratives based on player choice, this is a first for <em>HeroQuest</em>.</p>

<p>The expansion contains 36 illustrated cards, 29 detailed unpainted miniatures, and 29 double-sided cardboard pieces.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> is the second major quest pack to release for this new era of the board game. After being discontinued in 2010 and a brief fan reprint in 2021, the <em>HeroQuest</em> line was brought back to retail thanks to a licensing deal with Hasbro. That licensing deal included the production of new expansions as well as organized play support.</p>

<p>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak will be available for pre-order August 1 on Amazon and fan retailers. It will be sold at an MSRP of $44.99. You will need a copy of the HeroQuest main game to use this new expansion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-frenetic-wild-ride</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-a-frenetic-wild-ride.886770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-frenetic-wild-ride<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With a name like <em>Anger Foot</em>, that's a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. This is one wacky game all about kicking baddies through the mean streets of Shit City. You're on a quest to steal back your beloved shoe collection, and you'll stop at nothing to get those precious kickers back.</p>

<p>It's really hard not to be goofy about <em>Anger Foot</em>, because the premise is so fun, even if it's a bit simplistic. After all, you're just kicking your way through droves of goons, and maybe you'll pick up a few guns along the way. There's definitely a game underneath all this goofiness, though, and it seems to have improved since my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foot-is-hotline-miami-for-foot-fetishists">last foray</a> into the madness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=klFVGiR4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=otXDKfvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crime is law, and law is crime!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Mean Streets of <em>Anger Foot'</em>s... WHAT City?</h2>

<p>Developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/free-lives">Free Lives</a>' efforts have not gone unnoticed in polishing up this title. If you managed to play <em>Anger Foot </em>at PAX or during a Steam Next Fest, you'll know there was a solid foundation for a game. In this new build, however, the look of <em>Anger Foot</em> has improved a great deal, level designs are expanded, and it also adds new (and outrageously weird) story segments.</p>

<p>In terms of graphics, the lighting Free Lives added to <em>Anger Foot</em> did wonders to the overall aesthetic of the game. You're in this dank, dirty city full of violence and chaos, so it's fitting that the game takes a bit of a darker look. The shaders don't clash with the brighter, cartoonish style and create a very playful aesthetic.</p>

<p>Levels, on the other hand, appear more detailed with clutter and objects that go flying when you unleash your hellish kick on enemies. Enemies, trash, beer bottles, barrels, and doors go flying at every kick and makes for some chaotic and lighthearted action.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=JYFNeiQ- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=EOvy3e09 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kid's Mom won't be happy when she hears he's been watching TELEVISION!</figcaption></figure><p>Level layouts I remember from my previous sessions with <em>Anger Foot</em> seem a bit longer and more intricate. There are more side paths or rooms added this time around, giving off the feeling of a more finished product.</p>

<p>As for the world itself, we see it get fleshed out in more story segments -- these occur every few levels. Our hellbent hero can walk through the streets and apartments and interact with Shit City's various denizens -- and no, I'm not making that name up. It's really called Shit City.</p>

<p>The crude humor of <em>Anger Foot</em> isn't going to appeal to everyone, but it can be quite comical at times. Crime is normal in Shit City, you see, so laws are non-existent. This flips society on its head, and instead of being shamed for littering, you have whole gangs dedicated to polluting the city.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=ysNEyEIS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=RD359WPU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm sure this is totally safe and sanitary.</figcaption></figure><p>There are other groups, too, like the Violence Gang, lead by Goo Cop. At one point during a story segment, I learned that initiation into the Violence Gang required one to be shanked. But you know, that's one of the more <em>normal</em> interactions amongst this city's people.</p>

<p>Heck, have you ever seen a masked-up thug hold a dolphin at gunpoint? Man, in Shit City, instead of ridding the city's water source of microplastics, we have hooligans making <em>macroplastics</em>. There are some real out-of-pocket moments that'll likely get a chuckle or two out of you, and honestly, I can't wait to learn more about the other gangs in <em>Anger Foot</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=7gZWkiAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AXUriARo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wonder if he skipped leg day?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Anger Foot -- </em>it's Faster, Better, and Harder</h2>

<p>If you aren't weird like me, then you'll probably care more about the gameplay than whatever the hell is going on in Shit City. Fair, and you may be happy to know you can skip story segments if you so choose. If you're here for gameplay, <em>Anger Foot</em> retains that same <em>Hotline Miami-</em>inspired, balls-to-the-wall, one-hit-kill philosophy.</p>

<p>You've got a foot that can kick, and a hand that can hold guns. You can kick bad guys and take their guns, shoot when you need to, and kick when all else fails. Knocking down doors as fast as you can while rushing to the finish is the name of the game.</p>

<p>I like the gameplay, for the most part. It's simple, but with the physics and chaos at every level (as well as some better level design), we have a fast-paced, solid experience. The difficulty this time around feels a bit more punishing than last time, which is a shame since<em> </em>my last sessions with<em> </em><em>Anger Foot</em> felt juuust right.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-shotgun.jpg?itok=8GCH6cYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-shotgun.jpg?itok=xugMDyLZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not just gangsters you'll be fighting.</figcaption></figure><p>The one-hit kill mechanic mentioned, as in you can kill enemies in one hit and they can do the same to you, mostly applies here, although in some instances I was able to survive a bullet or blow from a bad guy. Gameplay is timed and with challenges for every level, you're incentivized to get to the exit as fast as possible. This is where the gameplay felt at odds with itself.</p>

<p>Because you're incentivized to go fast, you want to rush through levels. Enemies, however, are often placed in blind spots or have aim rivaling that of a Navy SEAL sniper, meaning you're going to die a lot. Oftentimes, it just feels unfair. If you don't beeline for the thugs with the guns right away, you're going to restart almost immediately.</p>

<p>The aim felt just a little <em>too</em> good on these guys, so you can avoid shots by hiding behind a wall or going slower -- but why <em>would</em> you want to go slower when <em>Anger Foot</em> urges the player to rush? The difficulty just felt off, and that feeling of rushing was exacerbated by challenges that seemed impossible to complete with how many thugs with guns you'd happen across.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay.jpg?itok=AkPMeWkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay.jpg?itok=i20A1KqL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When all else fails, use guns.</figcaption></figure><p>After making my way through, by my estimation around 40 percent of <em>Anger Foot</em>, it's evident there's been a lot of fine-tuning. I love the <a>outrageous</a>, silly world Free Lives is developing and its universe has the potential to expand across multiple games. I have no doubt the rest of <em>Anger Foot</em> is equally stellar, but the current difficulty might just be a little too much for me.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-college-football-25%E2%80%99s-unique-features-make-it-look-like-way-more-than-a-madden-reskin.886767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168832/ea-sports-college-football-25-new-features-like-madden<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7XzBDG">Summer is only just starting, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24159066/ea-sports-college-football-trailer-analysis">college football fans are already itching to head back to campus</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a>. The upcoming game marks the franchise’s return after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports">over 10 years of absence</a>, and will be the first game in the series to feature officially licensed player likenesses, thanks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5525588/2024/05/29/ea-sports-college-football-25-video-games-nil/">NIL money and a large-scale campaign to pay players to appear in the game</a>. On Friday, EA released a massive deep-dive into the game’s ridiculous number of new features, and the ways it aims to create the most realistic college football experience ever, both on and off the field. </p>
<p id="9rL168">With real players in the game for the first time, many of <em>College Football 25</em>’s new features put an emphasis on making it clear what separates the best players in the sport from everyone else. The game includes a variety of players traits that will augment gameplay, like responding better to high pressure situations and being able to identify on-coming blitzers. There will be more than 80 of these traits in the game at launch, as well as different tiers for each one. </p>
<p id="WtcgpY">The game will also feature an extensive new injury system called Wear and Tear, which shows the specific injury effects of each play, and how much it increases a player’s risk of injury. While this is important during games, it’s even more important in modes like Dynasty, where you run an entire college football program and have to look after your players from game to game. </p>
<div id="5C5ugz"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf86x8F9M90?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WRwJy2">One of the ways the game appears to be a major departure from the Madden franchise is also true of college football versus the NFL: There’s way more variety in playbooks. <em>College Football 25</em> already seems pretty dedicated to preserving the individuality and quirks of the 134 schools in the game. There’s a detailed option system in the game, including a Flexbone formation with Air Force’s signature triple option. There’s a new feature which lets players pull the ball back and run with it in the middle of a called reverse, and EA even highlights a wide formation, a staple for Oklahoma. </p>
<p id="Bm9dk7">EA also takes time to note how important real-life tradition is to the presentation of games in <em>College Football 25</em>. Every stadium and fan base in college football has their own unique rituals, and EA has tried to capture as many of those as they can for the game, licensing certain songs for team walkout music (<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/ea-college-football-25-enter-sandman-jump-around-iconic-songs/73f0857036908ba007de66e9">though not every song could be secured</a>), and including fan traditions like Tennessee’s checkered stadium and Penn State’s “White Out”. All of this is in service of not just recreating the authentic highs of a college home game, but also to enhance the game’s new emphasis on home field advantage, with the ridiculously loud stadiums making it harder for the away team to concentrate on things like calling hot routes.</p>
<p id="qcPNwf">These are just a few of the new features EA Sports announced for the game on Friday. To get a look at more of the features, EA has put together a short gameplay video narrated by sportscaster Kirk Herbstreit, as well as a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">very in-depth blog post</a> that outlines each of the game’s new systems in great detail. </p>
<p id="WDcFqN"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> is set for release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19.</p>

Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Tokuro Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> runs on 3D technology, with gameplay designed around 2D principles. This is why it’s described as a 2.5D game. I think 2D games have a certain kind of charm that 3D doesn’t. I also wanted to push the limits of what could be done. To bring my vision to life, I needed to use 2D principles along with 3D CG visuals.

It was all a blur when things started, but as development progressed, it began taking shape.</p><p>“You could consider <em>Tomba!</em> an open-world title, a term that was rarely used back then. There’s a wide area with a lot of different content in it. You encounter, discover, and collect various things as you move around. For example, you have to complete certain tasks in <em>Tomba!</em>, but you can wander around freely and complete them however you like. Some tasks and main objectives can even be skipped entirely. Many of the ideas I envisioned for <em>Tomba!</em> back in the day were ideas we see in <a title="Genres > Open-World [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a> design today.</p><p>“I initially wanted to include 100 quests, but the final game exceeded that. It was hard work for the team to fit it all together on a timeline. What started out as vague ideas in my head ballooned into an amount of content so large it blew my mind!”</p><p><video id="video-886605-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>The original PlayStation was a massive leap in gaming technology. What was it like to experience it back then?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “Game development is an ongoing battle against technology growth. This was the case back then and is still true today. I felt that the PlayStation was such a remarkable improvement in terms of hardware, allowing for greater possibilities. Games went from being rendered in pixels to CG. Game developers had to learn many new skills. Expectations ballooned along with the scope of game ideas. Development environments evolved, which made things challenging but exciting for developers. The introduction of the PlayStation and the advancements from that era still impact games today.”</p><p><video id="video-886605-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>Finally, why do you think it’s important to bring <em>Tomba!</em> back now?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> has been around for a long time, but continues to be loved by many. I’ve long wished that the game could be accessible to more people on modern systems. Now that the opportunity is here, I think PlayStation fans today will get a ton of enjoyment out of <em>Tomba!</em>“</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">College football’s best quarterbacks stay calm, cool, and collected in the pocket. But that’s always easier said than done when you have over 100,000 fans at Beaver Stadium or in Death Valley cheering so loud you can’t even hear yourself think. Here is everything you need to know about confidence and composure in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. </p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Abilities in <em>College Football 25</em> help players differentiate themselves from the rest of the competition and provide boosts that could be the difference in winning a game. However, confidence and composure are two other skills that every college athlete needs to perform at the highest level, and EA created a feature that replicates that. </p>  <figure data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="College Football 25 | Gameplay Deep Dive" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf86x8F9M90?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">As explained in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf86x8F9M90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep dive trailer</a>, confidence and composure are constantly changing features that depend on players getting hot or cold depending on the outcome of each play. For example, a freshman will have more erratic tendencies, and as the crowd level increases, it will affect their confidence.&nbsp;Events such as scoring touchdowns can lift the morale of your entire team, while individual achievements such as a pass breakup can significantly boost the composure of the player who made the big play.</p>
 <p data-characters="624" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">Composure goes hand-in-hand with individual player archetypes. In the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">gameplay deep</a><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">dive blog</a>, EA used an example of a scrambling quarterback who gets hot will have improved ball security, while a field general will benefit from improved throw accuracy. There are also mental abilities that will impact composure. The Legion ability increased the confidence of other defensive backs when that player gets an interception, but these mental abilities are also lost whenever a player goes cold. Coaches will have to manage their players based on how cold or hot they are and how experienced they are given a certain situation. </p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">If the home crowd is getting louder, it might be smart to do a simpler play so the player doesn’t make a mistake because of their confidence and composure. </p>

<p data-characters="395" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Viz Media announced today that <em>Spy x Family</em> creator Tatsuya Endo has <a href="https://x.com/VIZMedia/status/1796585941605155077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a collection of one shots coming this Spring</a> titled <em>Four Lives Remain: Tatsuya Endo Before Spy x Family</em>. As you might have guessed from the name, it’s giving serious Tatsuki Fujimoto Before Chainsaw Man vibes and will surely give a look inside the creations of Endo before the release of the popular <em>Spy x Family</em> manga. </p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcement: Journey back to the 2000’s with this stand-alone collection of dark and gritty one shots from Spy x Family creator, Tatsuya Endo.

As of just a couple of months ago, the <em>Spy x Family</em> manga had over 35 million copies in circulation making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.</p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Following <a href="https://x.com/VIZMedia/status/1796585941605155077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viz Media’s tweet</a> that confirmed the collection would be dark and gritty, fans have already started drawing comparisons to <em>TISTA</em>, a 2007 series by Endo that followed a young assassin named Tista Rockwell. If you’ve not seen it, it may be hard to picture Endo getting overly dark and gritty, but if you’ve seen <em>TISTA</em>, you know it’s certainly in his wheelhouse.</p> <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false"><em>Four Lives Remain: Tatsuya Endo Before Spy x Family </em>will be released in Spring 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is a game designed to create the illusion that you’ve entered another world. Epic fantasy novels heavily inspired the creators of <em>D&amp;D,</em> and the tabletop role-playing game’s connection to fantasy literature has only grown stronger with age.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Both the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> and the <em>Dungeon Masters Guide</em> encourage players and DMs to hit their local library before they get to work<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/try-this-devious-dnd-pact-of-the-chain-warlock-build/"> designing their next character</a> or crafting their party’s next adventure. I’ve been playing <em>D&amp;D</em> on both sides of the DM screen for years, and I can safely confirm that the ten standalone books and series listed below helped me create some of my favorite characters and campaigns.</p>
 <h3 id="h-10-the-dresden-files-by-jim-butcher" data-injectable="false">10. The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lionsgate</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">Some of the best <em>D&amp;D</em> campaigns I’ve been in revolved around solving mind-bending mysteries with a magical twist. If your latest campaign is a noir-influenced fantasy whodunnit that’s piqued your interest in the mystery genre, you should check out <em>The Dresden Files</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Jim Butcher’s long-running urban fantasy series follows the adventures of the titular sorcerous detective, who dedicates his eternally imperiled life to solving outlandish capers tied to Chicago’s hidden magical underworld. If you’re in the market for some exciting noir tales that happen to feature the odd vampire or demon, <em>The Dresden Files</em> is for you.</p> <h3 id="h-9-the-cthulhu-mythos-by-h-p-lovecraft-and-august-derluth" data-injectable="false">9. The Cthulhu Mythos by H.P. Lovecraft and August Derluth</h3> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via TheCollector</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">Many of <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s most iconic monsters, including the multi-eyed, beam-spewing Beholder, are beings from the Far Realm, a plane of pure cosmic chaos where the line between reality and illusion becomes illegible. I’ve been in more than a few D&amp;D games where the Far Realm’s innate insanity slithered its way into the mix, and this refreshing dose of existential dread wouldn’t t have been possible without the<em> Cthulu Mythos</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">H.P. Lovecraft’s tales about a pantheon of incomprehensible extraterrestrial gods lurking in the shadows of the universe pioneered the cosmic horror genre, and <em>D&amp;D</em> players are looking to add a bit of eldritch spice to their latest character or campaign will find plenty of inspiration in them. Be warned: Lovecraft was, to put it bluntly, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21363945/hp-lovecraft-racism-examples-explained-what-is-lovecraftian-weird-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racist</a>, and his uncensored work <em>will</em> make most readers uncomfortable.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-the-lord-of-the-rings-by-j-r-tolkien" data-injectable="false">8. The Lord of the Rings by J.R. Tolkien</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via New Line Cinema</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">It would be heresy not to put <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>on this list. J.R.R. Tolkien’s famous literary cycle was <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s biggest inspiration, to the point where <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/blog/cease-and-desist-dont-mess-with-tolkien/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were legal disputes</a> surrounding the early usage of terms like orc, elf, dwarf, and dragon.</p>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Some D&amp;D fans might be surprised to see <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> ranked so low. I’d still recommend Tolkien’s iconic trilogy to any <em>D&amp;D</em> player who hasn’t read them, especially if they started playing a campaign set within the Forgotten Realms. However, <em>D&amp;D</em> grew out of Middle Earth’s shadow long ago, and saying that <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is “the” series for <em>D&amp;D</em> fans feels a bit regressive, especially since many modern <em>D&amp;D</em> settings go out of their way to buck the tropes Tolkien established.</p>
 <h3 id="h-7-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-by-steven-erikson" data-injectable="false">7. Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">One of the best parts of a <em>D&amp;D</em> campaign is building the world where the story will play out, especially if the group’s DM is willing to let the other players in on the world-building process. If you and anyone else at your table are kicking around the idea of starting a new campaign set at a much later or earlier point in your world’s history, <em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em> will give you some great ideas.</p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">The <em>Malazan</em> series is a masterclass in fantasy world-building that follows the rise of the titular empire over millennia. With a cast consisting of immortal mages and dynasties with lineages stretching back centuries, <em>Malazan</em> is perfect for players and DMs who want to explore how the passage of time can change a character, a civilization, or even a world’s innate magic.</p> <h3 id="h-6-mistborn-by-brandon-sanderson" data-injectable="false">6. Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson</h3> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Dicebreaker</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Any experienced <em>D&amp;D</em> can attest that the Rogue is one of the funniest classes to play. Plenty of fantasy novels star nimble-fingered sneaks who prefer to creep through the shadows while the warriors and the mages hog the spotlight, but few will feel more familiar to <em>D&amp;D </em>players than <em>Mistborn</em>.</p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Brandon Sanderson’s seminal fantasy series unfolds in the world of Scadriel, where ash never stops falling from the sky, an oppressive empire rules most of the world, and the only hope of defeating the fallen hero of prophecy lies in a young thief named Vin. Vin is essentially an Arcane Trickster Rogue, and her quest to overthrow the Final Empire with magic and subterfuge is full of fun twists on established fantasy tropes that will leave <em>D&amp;D</em> fans in awe.</p>
 <h3 id="h-5-the-book-of-the-new-sun-by-gene-wolf" data-injectable="false">5. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolf</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Simon &amp; Schuster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">One of <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s most “peculiar” settings is <em>Dark Sun</em>, a grim realm where magic is inherently toxic and a gang of vicious Sorcerer Kings rule everything under the red, dying sun. <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/dark-sun-problematic">Due to some problematic elements of its world-building</a>, <em>Dark Sun</em> has not received an official setting book for a while, but anyone who enjoys it will find a suitable substitute in <em>The Book of the New Sun</em> series.</p>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">Set on a far-future version of Earth where society has regressed to feudalism, <em>The Book of the New Sun</em> is a haunting parable that follows a disgraced torturer’s transformation into a messianic figure who holds the key to the world’s future. Visions of the future and mysterious magics abound in this series, and anyone who’s experienced the world of <em>Dark Sun</em> will feel right at home reading this.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-by-george-r-r-martin" data-injectable="false">4. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Biblioctopus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">I’m one of those <em>D&amp;D</em> players who love to lose themselves in their character, and I’ll always prefer a campaign that gives me the complex challenge of navigating interpersonal relationships over ones that focus on dungeon-crawling or combat. If you’re also one of those players, I can’t think of a fantasy series you’ll like more than <em>A Song of Ice and Fir</em>e.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">George R.R. Martin’s iconic world runs on dynastic politics, not magic or prophecies, and its dedication to subverting and reimagining established fantasy tropes means that none of the characters you come to care about are safe. Any fan of <em>D&amp;D</em> and other character-driven TTRPGs will love <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>.</p> <h3 id="h-3-wings-of-fire-by-tui-t-sutherland" data-injectable="false">3. Wings of Fire by Tui. T Sutherland</h3> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Scholastic</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">If the title didn’t tip you off, dragons are an important part of <em>D&amp;D</em>, and there are a wide variety of them across the game’s many supplements and setting books. Some of my favorite (and most traumatic) <em>D&amp;D</em> memories are tied to dragons, and the only fantasy book that comes close to challenging D&amp;D’s draconic diversity is Tui T. Sutherland’s <em>Wings of Fire</em> series.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">The world of <em>Wings of Fire</em> has a dragon for almost every element, and players who’ve run a Dragonblood Sorcerer will feel more than a little validated reading the series.</p> <h3 id="h-2-the-sword-of-shannara-by-terry-brooks" data-injectable="false">2. The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks</h3> <figure data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MTV and Spike</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">One of the DMs in my local <em>D&amp;D</em> group has weaponized the art of the “mid-campaign twist.” Every game he runs shifts pitch at the halfway mark, re-contextualizing everything we’ve done up until that point in shocking and exciting ways. Terry Brooks<em> Shannara</em> series does something very similar, and D&amp;D fans who know what it’s like to watch the world you’ve adventured through turn upside down will feel a bit of nostalgia reading it.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">At the onset, the <em>Shannara</em> books feel like a near-complete rip-off of Tolkien, with elves, young naive warriors, and magical MacGuffins designed to kill evil overlords. However, as the books progress, shocking secrets about the world of Shannara are unmasked, and readers are left to grapple with the knowledge that this world might not be as fantastical as it appeared at first glance.</p> <h3 id="h-1-discworld-by-terry-pratchett" data-injectable="false">1. Discworld by Terry Pratchett</h3> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Paul Kidby</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">What is <em>D&amp;D, </em>if not the perfect blend of fantasy? The game gives you all the tools you’d ever need to slot every fantastical creature and form of magic into your campaign setting; the only limits that exist are those in your imagination. For this reason, I believe that no fantasy book embodies the spirit of <em>D &amp; D</em> more than <em>Discworld.</em></p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="false">The flat realm of Discworld is a wonderous patchwork woven together with elements pulled from almost every mythology, religion, and folklore tradition in the world. Wizards, demons, gods, and Death himself exist harmoniously as part of a magical ecosystem where nothing feels out of place. As funny as it is profound, <em>Discworld</em><strong> </strong>is the perfect fantasy series for <em>D&amp;D</em> fans.</p>

<p id="LAZuoW"><strong>Type:</strong> Energy fusion rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Upgrade to the deluxe edition of The Final Shape</p>
<p id="OFtzMR">Tessellation is technically a <em>Final Shape</em> Exotic, even if it’s been available since 2023 for those who pre-ordered the <strong>deluxe edition</strong> of the expansion. And while upgrading to the deluxe edition is the only way to get this thing for the foreseeable future, it’ll eventually come to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-beyond-light-guide/22159754/destiny-2-exotic-archive-monument-to-lost-lights-currencies-spoils-conquest-cipher">Monument of Lost Lights</a>, where you can use an Exotic Cipher and some currency to purchase it.</p>
<p id="k5lxcv">If you’re trying to decide if Tessellation is worth the deluxe upgrade, here’s what it does. The Intrinsic Exotic perk for Tessellation is <strong>Property: Undecidable</strong>, which causes the weapon to adapt its damage type to match your current grenade type, as well as grant bonus grenade energy on kills. This allows you to get Strand or Stasis weapons in your Energy slot for the first time ever, which should be very helpful for the new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163822/prismatic-final-shape-interview-bungie">Prismatic subclass</a>.</p>
<p id="82QbQA">The secondary Exotic perk for Tessellation is <strong>Property: Irreducibile</strong>, which allows you to hold reload and suck your grenade into the weapon. You’ll then be able to fire that grenade out of your Tessellation, which creates an elemental explosion based on your grenade’s element.</p>
<p id="JKiAGH">The new expansion will also add a new Catalyst for Tessellation, which is still a mystery, but could introduce significant changes to the gun — like the Catalyst for Quicksilver Storm did back in <em>Lightfall</em>.</p>

<p id="QQxj7W">Red Death Reformed is, as the name suggests, a remake of Red Death — a beloved Exotic from the original <em>Destiny</em>. Red Death Reformed also shares some similar functionality to the Exotic hand cannon Crimson (also designed after the original Red Death), and is a Solar pulse rifle that heals you whenever you kill enemies.</p>
<p id="mcXie3">Red Death Reformed’s Intrinsic Exotic perk is <strong>Redemption</strong>, which causes final blows with the pulse rifle to Cure you and increase your reload speed. Reloading Red Death Reformed after you get a kill causes it to Cure nearby allies as well. The <strong>Inverse Relationship</strong> Exotic perk causes you to flinch less as well as gain increased handling and movement speed when you deal damage with Red Death Reformed. The Exotic pulse also deals more damage when your health gets low.</p>
<p id="7KniQJ">Based on testing at a preview event for <em>The Final Shape</em>, this pulse rifle its healing capabilities are very powerful, even when you’re playing by yourself. It’s a great pick if you’re struggling to complete an activity without dying, and you should consider using it in the Legendary version of <em>The Final Shape</em> campaign. </p>

<p id="OZ6kDL"><strong>Type:</strong> Solar sniper rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Currently unknown</p>
<p id="saR1uf">Still Hunt has three Exotic traits. Its Intrinsic perk is <strong>Cayde’s Retribution</strong>, which causes any Orbs of Power you collect or precision hits you land to charge Still Hunt’s Super meter. Once the meter is full, you can hold reload to fire three Golden Gun shots. These shots work just like Golden Gun for Hunters, meaning that each shot does more damage than the last, and it only fires one shot if you’re using the Exotic Hunter helmet Celestial Nighthawk. </p>
<p id="YCl4Bl">Its other two Exotic perks are <strong>Golden Munitions</strong>, which causes the weapon to gain bonus ammo whenever you activate Golden Gun, and <strong>Sharpshooter</strong>. Sharpshooter gives Still Hunt bonuses to target acquisition, aim down sight speed, and flinch resistance. All of those bonuses are enhanced when the Golden Gun mode is active, meaning you’ll be able to hit your shots even if you’re under fire.</p>
<p id="3b61iu">This weapon deals very impressive damage to majors, mini-bosses, and bosses. </p>

<p id="rZ8j9H">Khvostov is an iconic Destiny weapon. The non-Exotic form is the first gun you pick up in both the original <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2</em>, and it was also a fully customizable Exotic back in the first game. It’s finally back in <em>Destiny 2</em> in its Exotic form, but has entirely new perks this time around.</p>
<p id="FypN2q">Khvostov 7G-0X’s main perk is called <strong>The Right Choice</strong>, which causes every seventh bullet to ricochet between enemies and deal additional damage. Its Exotic Trait is <strong>Eyes Up, Guardian</strong>, which causes Orbs of Power to strengthen the bounce effect, giving you bonus bounces and damage. If that wasn’t good enough, it also comes with the Shoot-to-Loot perk.</p>
<p id="sbYR3x">This gun is very powerful, acting almost like a Kinetic Sunshot. It’s especially potent when paired with the new Prismatic subclass, as it can charge both your Light and Darkness Transcendence meters.</p>

<p id="ilKgmN">While Bungie hasn’t announced it yet, we know via the Episode roadmap that each new Episode will come with both an Exotic weapon (Red Death Reformed, in this case), and a new Exotic mission. That means that sometime before Episode: Echoes is over, we’ll be getting a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24124313/whisper-walkthrough-worm-exotic-pattern">Whisper</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24155578/zero-hour-walkthrough-outbreak-perfected-exotic-pattern">Zero Hour</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/23629311/vexcalibur-the-variable-avalon-secret-mission">Avalon</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24008173/starcrossed-secret-chest-wish-keeper-exotic">Starcrossed</a>, or something in that vein. That means whatever this Exotic is, it’ll probably be craftable, and we’ll be able to earn new perks each week.</p>

<h2 id="RhrvWh"><strong>All Exotic armor in The Final Shape</strong></h2>
<p id="uILAJw">Not counting the Exotic class items, there are six new Exotic armor pieces in <em>The Final Shape</em> — two per class. All six of these new Exotics will come from Rahool and his new Exotic-deciphering loyalty program. You’ll need to increase Rahool’s reputation in order to unlock them.</p>
<p id="uJI8EZ">The Exotic class items allow Prismatic Guardians to mix the effects of two existing Exotics together, and won’t be available until after <em>The Final Shape </em>raid launches on June 7.</p>

<p id="qfyMOJ"><strong>Type:</strong> Titan gauntlets<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="QsW3WX">The Exotic perk for Wishful Ignorance is called <strong>Wish-Dragon’s Talons</strong>, and it causes your Frenzied Blade to gain a fourth charge. While wearing this Exotic, your Frenzied Blade and Flechette Storm Aspect briefly increase their damage with each strike. Pulses from your Banner of War return melee energy to you based on how many allies you heal.</p>
<p id="2SVlAB">This Exotic has some massive implications for Strand Titans using both Banner of War and Flechette Storm. But the bonus Frenzied Blade charge and damage means that these might even be useful for Prismatic Titans, who don’t have access to either of those Strand Titan aspects.</p>

<p id="yL8zx5"><strong>Type:</strong> Titan chest<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="a4Pd8g">The Exotic perk for Hazardous Propulsion is <strong>Danger Close</strong>, which causes weapon precision hits or kills to have a chance to load Kinetic Exodus rockets into the chest piece. Whenever you use your class ability, you’ll fire any stored Exodus rockets, which home in on enemy targets. Dealing damage with your Exodus rockets give you a temporary buff that increases all rocket launcher damage.</p>
<p id="U3y48z">This chest piece has a lot of potential for Titans. Not only do these rockets deal quite a bit of damage, but the boost to rocket launchers could seriously increase Titans’ DPS in boss fights.</p>

<p id="4aFKyr"><strong>Type:</strong> Hunter legs<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="CCwxiW">The Exotic perk for Balance of Power is called <strong>Double Down</strong>, and it causes your Threaded Specter to last longer and have more durability. This enhanced Threaded Specter also releases additional Threadings when it takes damage. Finally, you won’t appear on any enemy radars when standing near your Threaded Specter.</p>
<p id="kAi7oZ">This is more of a PvP Exotic than a PvE one, but it will definitely annoy any Crucible opponents you go up against as a Strand Hunter.</p>

<p id="4ewSb6"><strong>Type:</strong> Warlock helmet<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="BMQosA">The Exotic perk for Speaker’s Sight is <strong>The Lost Voice</strong>, which causes your healing grenades to spawn a Restorative Turret. Healing allies has a chance to spawn an Orb of Power.</p>
<p id="o5Zbvm">This Exotic could be very useful for Solar or Prismatic Warlocks looking to keep their teammates healthy. Healing grenades normally just give a single burst of healing to allies, but with Speaker’s Sight, Warlocks can lock down an area for a while by providing constant healing for their Fireteam.</p>

<p id="HMhus5"><strong>Type:</strong> Warlock chest<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="hB48jt">The Exotic perk for Mataiodoxia is <strong>Stylostixis</strong>, which causes any targets you damage with your Arcane Needle Strand melee to emit a Suspending burst when they die. If you land multiple Arcane Needles on a single target, an even larger Suspending burst will immediately occur. Killing any suspended targets grants you melee energy and your Arcane Needles can pierce Barrier Champions.</p>
<p id="w3L3se">This Exotic gives Strand Warlocks some additional options for Suspending targets — something the class is already good at doing. But perhaps more importantly, it gives Prismatic Warlocks a reliable way to Suspend enemies since they don’t have access to a Suspend grenade. </p>

<p id="8m7zDs"><strong>Type:</strong> Titan mark, Hunter cloak, Warlock bond<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Mysterious post-raid mission</p>
<p id="LGZBSU">The Exotic class items are the only Exotic armor pieces you won’t be able to get from Rahool the Cryptarch this episode. Instead, they’ll come from a mysterious activity that won't be released until after Guardians complete the raid on June 7. </p>
<p id="eBqU4w">As for the class items themselves, they may have different names, but they all function the same. Each class item — <strong>Essentialism</strong>, <strong>Stoicism</strong>, and <strong>Solipsism </strong>— has random rolls, and each will get one Exotic perk in its first column and one in its second column. The idea is that these class items let you mix and match multiple Exotic effects together. The perk pools are (mostly) different between the three classes, and (mostly) contain effects belonging to Exotics from their particularly class — i.e. Titans typically will only be able to use other Titan effects. </p>
<p id="Bxyn7X">The “spirit” versions of the perks on these class items aren’t the entire Exotic perks from the original Exotics, and are usually missing an effect. If you want to use Spirit of Abeyant on your Titan, for example, you’ll only get the three-pronged Suspending blasts from the Abeyant Leap Exotic. If you want to get Woven Mail whenever you Suspend an enemy — the other half of Abeyant Leap — you’ll need to wear that Exotic instead.</p>
<p id="20E0nu">Finally, these Exotic class items only work while you’re using the new Prismatic subclass, so keep that in mind. </p>
<p id="2zhpQ3">Below, here are the perk pools for each of the three Exotic class items:</p>

That mystery is intentional, as the story is a big draw for players and Square Enix doesn’t want to spoil the fun. However, that hasn’t stopped the developer from giving us a few hints on some activities and experiences players will be able to enjoy in <em>Dawntrail </em>outside of the main story questline.<br></p><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195752,195618" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/contents/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/contents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> official site</a></span> for the <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion went live on May 30, and it contains some new information on the expansion’s raid series and field operations. We already knew that the Echoes of Vana’diel, the large-scale alliance raid series for <em>Dawntrail</em>, would be an homage to<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/its-2019-and-im-starting-final-fantasy-xi-1831994613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/its-2019-and-im-starting-final-fantasy-xi-1831994613"><em>Final Fantasy XI</em></a></span>, but we now have information on the regular eight-person raid.

Step into the arena if you dare, and either rise to become champion, or fall forever in ignominy.” This is a long way of saying that the raid series will be a tournament arc in which players get to beat the crap out of cool enemies in an almost gladiatorial sport. It sounds like silly fun and gives the developers an excuse to basically throw whatever they want at us. That levity sounds in line with <em>Dawntrail</em>’s vacation vibes and is a welcome reprieve from the pretty lore-heavy and emotional raids we got in the last two expansions.<br></p><p>The other big reveal from the website is the Shades’ Triangle field operations. Just like in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-log-three-all-pros-n-1836214193&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-log-three-all-pros-n-1836214193"><em>Shadowbringers</em></a></span>’ Bozjan Southern Front, it appears like Shades’ Triangle will be a large-scale instanced location with its own massive quest line and big battles requiring cooperation amongst big groups of players. Based on the description, it sounds like this will be a Bermuda Triangle-like location. “Even the most dauntless of sailors would sooner abandon ship than steer into Shades’ Triangle,” the blurb reads. “Be not fooled by the lush and fertile island you spy on the horizon─men and vessels alike have been lost to its allure, never to be seen again. Yes, the wisest choice is to dismiss it as mere illusion. But of course, there are inevitably those who cannot resist the call of adventure.” I’ll be curious to see if these field operations somehow incorporate ships, as we’ve seen a lot of those in trailers and it would fit the tropical vibe of the expansion. In any case, it’s sure to be a great place to level the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-dawntrail-job-classes-free-trial-xbox-1850691863&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-dawntrail-job-classes-free-trial-xbox-1850691863">new Pictomancer and Viper jobs</a></span> quickly.</p><hr><p>There are a couple of smaller tidbits on the website, as well, including a short description of Beastmaster, the new limited job, as well as previously shown dungeons in the expansion. I’m fascinated to learn more about the new Ultimate raid, Futures Rewritten, as it will add to and build on my personal favorite raid series from the game so far,<em> Shadowbringers</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-helped-some-gaggling-final-fantasy-xiv-newbies-best-o-1837206210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-helped-some-gaggling-final-fantasy-xiv-newbies-best-o-1837206210">Eden series</a></span>.

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s tough being someone who, in the search for some sort of meaning in life, has arrived on video games as their foundation. I could have chosen a much worse passion, but I also could have probably picked one that would pass in normal conversation. Instead, no one I meet understands me. It’s lonely being better than everyone.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false"><em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em> gets me. Unfortunately. It’s a bizarre game about loving one thing so much that it becomes the central source of your alienation.</p> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">I think. That’s as much as I could glean from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154780/Elation_For_The_Wonder_Box_6000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less-than-10-minutes of demo</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="ELATION FOR THE WONDER BOX 6000 - OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK TRAILER" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Pjq0MnoxsY?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false"><em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>comes from Digital Tchotchkes, the creator of <em><a href="https://digitaltchotchkes.itch.io/go-fly-a-kite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go Fly a Kite</a></em>, which I should probably play. They describe the demo as, “it’s a costco free sample style demo.”</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">It starts off with a <em>Doom</em>-style text crawl telling you about the eponymous <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em>, a game so transcendental that the protagonist suggests that it is the apogee of video games as an art. That if only more people played and understood it, then art wouldn’t have died. It is the protagonist’s goal to acquire this lost relic.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">This opening exposition turns out to be something the protagonist is posting on the internet. The outpouring of distilled, potent opinions leads to them getting death threats, followed by a permanent ban from their chosen forum. We’ve all been there.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">You’re then left to explore the wreckage of the protagonist’s life. You mouse around to see what’s interactive and then click on what you find to hear about it. Through this, you discover that society has continued its course toward refining the endorphin supply, which is part of why nobody remembers something as artful as <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em>. Easier access to simpler stimulation has caused the masses to lose their way.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">It’s difficult to tell if <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>is making fun of, or trying to explain, the perpetually repeating discourse of how things were better in the before times. Or both. Why not take the high ground over every other perspective?</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">It represents a part of myself I’m unable to take <em>too </em>seriously. Some people have to travel abroad or get lost in the desert to “find themselves.” I’ve always known myself. I like video games. I might enjoy video games to an extent that other people find annoying. The whole reason I’m here (on this site, I mean) is that I want to support and spread the things I’m passionate about. It keeps me occupied until a bus finally decides to hit me.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">But also, and I can’t stress this enough, the <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>demo could be finished in less than 10 minutes. In that time, you look at stuff, talk to a person, and then walk to a place. That’s it. It could maybe be defined as the prologue. The game part of the game is beyond that demo wall.</p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t really get me <em>more</em> excited to play <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000,</em> but it also doesn’t make me <em>less</em> excited. I was just so disoriented when it ended.</p>
 <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false">On the other hand, it refers to the protagonist’s computer as “My portal to philistines,” which is what I will now call mine.</p>

<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Abilities are a new feature in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> that differentiates players from the competition and gives your team an extra edge on game day. Here is everything you need to know about the multi-layered system. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Unlike the NFL, which has 32 teams featuring the best professional athletes in the world, EA Sports College Football 25 includes 134 schools, meaning there is a huge gulf in talent. Five-star recruits in high school go to huge programs like Alabama, while two and three-star recruits will find themselves at smaller schools in a less distinguished conference. </p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">To achieve that authentic feeling of a gap in skill between different programs, EA created abilities, so players who are destined to be drafted into the NFL one day or were the best athletes in high school feel like that on the field. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">In <em>College Football 25</em>, there are 80 different abilities categorized into physical or mental categories. Each group is further divided into four tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. A player can have five physical and three mental abilities at most. For example, the Field General mental ability allows a player to identify blitzers post-snap for the bronze tier. As for the Platinum tier, the player can identify blitzers, a coverage shell, and disguised coverage pre-snap. </p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">An example of a physical ability is Downhill. The player will get slightly more broken tackles at Bronze after reaching max speed, and at Platinum, earn the ultimate ability to break tackles after reaching 80 percent of max speed.</p> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">EA committed to making sure that the abilities aren’t too overpowered. In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, the development team used the Pocket Shield ability as an example. Offensive linemen will hold blocks better on standard passing players, but even at the Platinum tier, the distance to the first down doesn’t apply if it is more than 10 yards. Every ability is situational and won’t be available for every play, to make games still feel balanced. </p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">EA didn’t go into detail on how players go about acquiring abilities and upgrading them. We will learn more about abilities and their impact on every game mode closer to launch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167893/sony-days-of-play-sale-2024-ps5-slim-digital-edition-psvr-2-games-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony’s recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168001/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-silent-hill">State of Play showcase</a> may have given us a brief glimpse into the company’s plans for 2024 and beyond, but that probably does little if you were hoping for something you can play right now. That’s where the Days of Play sale comes in. Now through June 12th, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/">Sony is discounting dozens of PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 titles</a>, as well as accompanying <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#consoles">hardware</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#accessories">accessories</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus/#subscriptions">subscriptions</a>.</p></div><p>First things first, if you’re still looking to pick up a PS5 console, you can save $50 on the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition</strong>, which are available for as low as $449 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrW9iY3e3">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>) and $399 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrWxZIomR">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>), respectively. These match the lowest prices we’ve seen on the newer PS5 models, which are slightly slimmer than Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">original PS5 console</a>. They also sport two front-facing USB-C ports and an expanded 1TB of built-in storage (up from 825GB), though keep in mind that only the disc-based version can play physical games and other Ultra HD Blu-ray discs.&nbsp;</p><p>As an added bonus, PlayStation Plus members who buy directly from PlayStation will receive 12 months of Netflix Premium, the streaming service’s most expensive tier. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">Read our hands-on impressions of the PS5 “slim.”</a></h5></p><div><p>Sony’s new standard PlayStation 5 includes a removable disc drive, dual front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and a slightly smaller and lighter design.</p></div><div><p>The PlayStation 5 Digital doesn’t come with a disc drive, but you can buy one separately if you later decide you want one. The console otherwise plays all of the same games as the version equipped with a disc drive.</p></div><p>Elsewhere on the hardware front, the <strong>PSVR 2</strong> is on sale starting at $449 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmonR1hkAm">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. That’s the best price we’ve seen on the virtual reality headset, which, sadly, often costs more than the PS5 that’s required to play it.</p><p>The PSVR 2’s price reflects its underrealized potential. Its launch library wasn’t the greatest, but it’s slowly and steadily building its catalog with a diverse selection of made-for-VR titles. This includes <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA09555_00-HZVRCALLMOUNTAIN"><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em></a>, which you can currently purchase from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmNa6JwUFh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle">PlayStation Direct</a> with a PSVR 2 starting at $499 ($100 off). The latest <em>Horizon </em>title is probably one of the better showcases for what Sony’s PC-grade VR headset is capable of, though new VR modes in AAA games like <em>Resident Evil 7 </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23609901/gran-turismo-7-psvr-2-hands-on"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> are thrilling, to say the least.<em> </em></p><p>Additionally, if you buy a PSVR 2 directly from Sony and subscribe to PlayStation Plus, you’ll also get 12 months of Netflix Premium for free, which saves you about $276 over the course of a year. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">Read our PSVR 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>Sony’s PSVR 2 offers eye tracking, effortless setup, and PC-grade VR without a PC (though it does require a PS5). It can also double as a virtual flatscreen for watching Blu-rays, streaming apps, and other content.</p></div><div><p>Sony sells a bundle consisting of its PSVR 2, controllers, and a physical copy of <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>&nbsp;for the PS5.</p></div><p>Now through June 9th, you can also save up to 30 percent on a <strong>12-month subscription to </strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions"><strong>PlayStation Plus via the PlayStation Store</strong></a>, which is stackable with existing subscriptions. The exact amount varies based on which plan you choose; however, the Essential tier is 20 percent off ($63.99), the Extra tier is 25 percent off ($101.24), and the Premium tier is 30 percent off ($111.99).</p><p>The entry-level <strong>Essential</strong> plan allows you to download free PS Plus games monthly, which are accessible for as long as you’re a subscriber to PlayStation Plus. It also unlocks multiplayer access in games that require it, exclusive discounts, and advanced console features like cloud storage and Share Play. <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong>, meanwhile, offers the same set of perks as well as access to hundreds of titles that rotate regularly, including those that are part of Ubisoft Plus. If you step up to <strong>PS Plus Premium</strong>, you can add game trials, cloud streaming, and access to even more PlayStation classics and a selection of Sony Pictures films.</p><div><p>PlayStation Plus offers three tiers — Essential, Extra, and Premium. All of these subscriptions offer online play, with varying degrees of downloadable games and advanced console features included as part of the membership.</p></div><p>A PlayStation sale without discounted games would be odd, so it’s no shocker that hundreds of digital PS4 and PS5 games are currently on sale. Most are up to 60 percent off, but you’ll find opportunities to save as much as 85 percent on select titles during the various 24-hour flash sales that will be available throughout the event.</p><p>But if you happen to miss something juicy there, you can still find great prices on newer exclusives like <em><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></em>, which is on sale starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MARVELS-SPIDER-MAN-2-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C7WQRCPB?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqTht7xXI">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MARVELSPIDERMAN2">PlayStation Store</a>. The digital deluxe edition is also available for $59.99 ($20 off) from the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MSM2DDE000000000">PlayStation Store</a>, while the collector’s edition is down to $149.99 ($80 off) in the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-games/marvels-spider-man-2-collectors-edition-ps5">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. The latter includes physical extras like a steelbook case and a 19-inch Venom statue featuring Peter Parker and Miles Morales, plus two in-game suits and various skill unlocks.</p><div><p>Insomniac’s latest <em>Spider-Man</em> romp for the PlayStation 5 ups the ante with a vast open world to explore, wonderful web-slinging mechanics, and the ability to play as not one but two spider-men. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> is also worth a look, especially now that it’s on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0783148264580163">PlayStation Store</a>. The modern rendition of Square Enix’s classic JRPG is actually beating the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167183/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-deal-sale-ps5">price we recently called out for the physical copy</a>, though you can also pick up the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0978938405039882">digital deluxe edition on sale for $67.49</a> (about $23 off).</p></div><div><p>The middle game in a three-part trilogy, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> continues the reimagining of the classic PS1 RPG with modern visuals, an expansive open world, new gameplay elements, and even better character development than the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><p>Unsurprisingly, you can also find sales on third-party PS4 and PS5 titles spanning multiple genres. For example, sports gamers looking to crack a bat can pick up <em><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></em> starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqU7HmZMx">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmlb-the-show-24-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-91019524">Target</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA17085_00-MLBTHESHOW24SHIP">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>If you’re not into baseball, there’s also <em><strong>WWE 2K24</strong></em>, which is easily 2K’s best wrestling game yet. It refines some of the more recent gameplay modes and adds new match types, including an ambulance match, a casket match, and a special guest referee. Right now, the base version is on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>The base game is great on its own, but if you’re looking to get the most out of it, I’d recommend grabbing the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24WMEDITION"><strong>40 Years of WrestleMania Edition</strong> for $89.99 ($30 off)</a>. It offers accelerators, boosters, and all five character packs planned for the game, including the new ECW Punk Pack that adds hardcore legends like CM Punk, The Dudley Boyz, Sandman, and Terry Funk.</p><div><p><em>MLB The Show 24</em> features photorealistic graphics, an updated roster with your favorite players, and some of the best baseball gameplay around.</p></div><div><p><em>WWE 2K24</em> is the newest wrestling game for the sports entertainment promotion. It builds on the incredibly fun gameplay of the prior two titles and adds in new game modes, match types, and a bigger roster than ever.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more Days of Play highlights</h3></p><div><ul><li><em><strong>Tekken 8</strong></em> is one of the fiercest fighting games out, and you can start practicing for <a href="https://www.evo.gg/events/las-vegas">July’s Evo tournament</a> with the Deluxe Edition, which is currently on sale for $69.99 ($30 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA10595_00-TK8DXEDITION0000">PlayStation Store</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168682/scavengers-reign-netflix-sci-fi-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1b8eU5">The streaming era operates via a cold and opaque calculus. Many shows unceremoniously premiere with limited promotion, only to face swift cancellation with an equal lack of fanfare. With no real numbers and a few dodgy reports available to the public and creators (now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163463/netflix-most-viewed-tv-movies-2023">a little less dodgy</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893273/wga-hollywood-writers-strike-tv-movie-contract-explained">the Writers Guild of America strike</a>), a show’s fate can feel like a cosmic joke, with no rhyme or reason to why some soldier on and some never get the chance to find an audience. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max"><em>Scavengers Reign</em></a>, the stunning animated series that debuted on Max last year, found its number was up when the streamer <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-streaming-1235912035/">canceled it earlier this May</a>. However, in a rare moment of clarity, there is a way forward for the show: It just has to be a hit starting Friday, when it premieres on Netflix. </p>
<p id="wtlh8m">Its new summer home (<em>Scavengers Reign</em> is still available to stream on Max) is <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-1235998046/">reportedly considering a season 2 renewal</a> pending the show’s Netflix debut, though what a favorable run looks like isn’t terribly clear. Mostly, this is just an excuse to exercise a rare bit of streaming-era agency: Go check out <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23599935/best-tv-shows-2023-new">the very best shows of last year</a>, and the rare series that earns the superlative of “like nothing else on television” simply by virtue of its stunning visual design. </p>

<p id="ROllfO">Taking visual cues from European sci-fi artists like Moebius and Simon Roy, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> chronicles the aftermath of a disaster aboard the spacecraft Demeter, following a handful of survivors that escaped to the alien world of Vesta Minor, a hauntingly beautiful and hostile planet. Yet survival is only a secondary concern for show creators Joe Bennett and Charles Huettner. Instead, the pair use <em>Scavengers Reign</em> as an exercise in crafting a truly alien world, with all of the awe and horror that entails. As our reviewer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max">wrote</a> when the show premiered last fall: </p>
<blockquote><p id="4fJH7x">Creature design and worldbuilding are one and the same in <em>Scavengers Reign</em>. Every animal, from the tiniest insect or docile herbivore to the most colossal and terrifying carnivore, exhibits a behavior that serves a function both within the moment-to-moment beats of an episode and in the larger ecosystem of Vesta Minor as a whole.</p></blockquote>

<p id="jiOdJA">Furthermore, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> isn’t merely concerned with creepy-gorgeous tourism. Instead, like <em>Jurassic Park</em>, its xenobiology doubles as potent metaphor, with each strange encounter a heartbreaking echo of some barely voiced pain each character carries. Why, for example, is the survivor Kamen haunted by his wife when a strange psychic quadruped holds him in its thrall? When local flora begins to infect the circuitry of Levi, the robotic companion of the stranded Azi, Levi begins to show signs of real, bona fide life in her synthetic shell — why does Azi seem so reluctant to see it? And Sam and Ursula, the only two humans stranded together, struggle to survive while maintaining harmony with the strange new land, but can that be done? Or is their effort inherently destructive? </p>
<p id="NiihK2"><em>Scavengers Reign</em> probes at heavy questions, lingers in moments of beauty and horror, and does it all with wonderfully rendered, languidly paced animation from studio Titmouse. Like all good art, it leaves plenty of room for the viewer to participate in it, to mull it over and think about what meaning might be found within. It’s the sort of story that’s done something wonderful, and stands a pretty good chance of dazzling us all once more, if given the opportunity. </p>
<p id="THD2fY">Give it a shot on Netflix this weekend. Maybe the show will get another season because of it, and maybe not. But what’s here ought to be celebrated. </p>

<p>Back at The Game Awards 2023, SEGA announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was making five new games</a> based on classic franchises like Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. Six months later, reliable insider Midori has an update the development of various games in the lineup.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796576390554501581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy Twitter thread</a>, Midori said that a number of the games have been pushed to a fiscal year 2028, including Games as a Service (GaaS) titles based on Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. These GaaS titles would be coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the full Unreal Engine 5 remakes</a> of Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio.</p>



<p>“Internally, both the Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi plans had already been previously delayed two different times, including the original reveal dates for the projects.,” he said. “The previous plan before this month was to release Jet Set Radio remake and reboot in 2026 and Crazy Taxi in 2027.” </p>



<p>She continued: “The Remake titles were supposed to release a short while before the reboots for fans of the original titles who did not want to play the GaaS reboots that are currently in development.”</p>



<p>Speaking of the remakes, she says that the Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio remakes were “very similar” to the originals. They will have some feature improvements and additions, however, including multiplayer for Crazy Taxi. Day one cosmetic DLC is also planned for the games.</p>



<p>In addition to those two games, Midori says that Golden Axe was originally planned to release in 2023. It got to the point that marketing plans were created for the game, but then, obviously, plans changed internally with the game not yet officially revealed. </p>



<p>“And now SOA [SEGA of America] is more involved in development and marketing of SEGA titles than before,” she said. “And communication has become more consistent between SOA and SOJ for these titles as part of global initiative. It is not just for Sonic titles.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>“Just be grateful you get to say goodbye.” “There’s nothing here for you anymore.” “Nostalgia can be a dangerous thing.” Simple one-liners like these are plentiful in the early conversations of 1000xResist, a story-driven game set in a far-flung future where humanity's scant remains live on through generations of clones. It’s easy to see that kind of writing and get the impression developer Sunset Visitor is perhaps a bit too eager to be melodramatic – but it trusts you’ll stick with it because their delivery and the context around them make moments like these as thoughtful as they are gut-wrenching. A striking visual style and an intoxicating mystery pull you in as its ambitious narrative structure comes together brilliantly, and in the process, its sharply written story makes bold and daring statements about family, political revolution, and the things that make us human.</p><p>It’s quite clear that 1000xResist draws from works like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review">NieR: Automata</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time-review">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>, or Satoshi Kon films, all of which blend surreal concepts with emotionally charged deconstructions of the human condition. You can use that as shorthand to get an idea of what this game goes for, but it quickly shows you that it’s so much more than just an amalgamation of influences. 1000xResist forges a strong identity steeped in its own fiction, establishing a wholly unique sci-fi world with its own culture, rules of governance, and belief systems – it does so with such confidence that I even found myself reciting the phrases its characters use throughout – a little “Hekki ALLMO,” or “Hair to hair,” goes a long way in these streets. That’s a microcosm of the experience; finding things which may not mean much at first glance that evolve into meaningful expressions that cut like a knife.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>1000xResist Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You spend most of your time controlling Watcher, one of six “Sisters” who are the leadership of a small civilization surviving in isolation on a remote station. They’re only referred to by the titles that represent their societal function, and it’s the Allmother, from which everyone was derived, who’s the godlike figure they all seem to revere. The story starts with a jolt by showing Watcher violently drive a shiv into the Allmother’s back, and the intensity of Watcher’s rage gives a staggering first impression – one that grows evermore shocking as you develop a deeper understanding of who the Allmother was. Unraveling this world also revolves around a deadly pandemic that wiped out nearly all of humanity, and the ensuing aftermath sets the foundation for why a society of clones made in her image exists at all.</p><p>You spend much of your time “communing” with other Sisters by navigating dreamlike scenarios, gradually uncovering a greater truth within surreal reconstructions of the Allmother’s memories. Interacting with characters and shifting through different time periods in various locations let conversations play out like pieces to a puzzle. Exploring these ethereal environments paints a more complete and harrowing picture of her life, and literal changes in perspective draw you into each scenario with specific intent – whether it’s through first-person, fixed camera angles, side-scrolling scenes, or third-person views as you fly across nodes to reach objectives, 1000xResist isn’t afraid to break both convention and expectation at critical points.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>1000xResist is a revolution in storytelling.</p></div><p>The station where the Sisters live acts as a main hub and has the vibe of a small-scale Citadel from Mass Effect. Spending time here to talk to the other Sisters and their understudies reveals crucial details that pull you closer to their world and way of life, and there’s so much charm and insight that comes through in these one-off conversations. Although it’s a bit of a pain to navigate, since the station is constructed in some really odd ways with winding hallways that don’t always lead to where you’d expect, it’s always worth the trouble. Even in its unsettling atmosphere where something always feels a little <em>off</em>, it’s still a sort of home that evokes a certain sentimentality.</p><p>Buried within the memories of the Allmother are pieces of her normal life; traces of her relationships at school, a tumultuous upbringing in a home with struggling parents, and some troubling decisions she made along the way. These moments are deeply personal, and distinctly born of the Asian diaspora. 1000xResist is rooted in the experience of a Chinese family coming to the west to seek refuge and rebuild a life from scratch while raising a child. Even when there were specific references to Chinese traditions and Mandarin phrases I wasn’t familiar with (but was always excited to learn about), it was all still so familiar to me, as if there could’ve been an alternate version of this exact story transposed with Filipino traditions and Tagalog phrases. It’s a cathartic and authentic representation of the common ground Asian Americans/Canadians share, extending to anyone who grew up a first generation from an immigrant family – the disconnect we feel from being pushed into assimilating and functioning in a western society while clinging on (sometimes reluctantly) to the cultures of our motherland. It's also an open invitation to those on the outside to see what our lives are really like, and a shining example of how <em>the local is universal</em>.</p><p>In my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review"><u>Persona 3 Reload review</u></a> from earlier this year, I had mentioned that its story and characters put a lot of the recent tragedies and hardships in my own life into perspective. By the time I rolled credits on 1000xResist, it had done the same but in a way that felt more <em>targeted</em>. From the feeling of “making it” when you’ve moved into a tiny apartment to the olive branches parents extend to their angsty teen kids to keep them connected to their culture, these are visions of a life so many of us have lived. 1000xResist is a representation of how we reflect on our upbringing and recognize the ways it shaped us as adults for better and worse, which is perspective that only comes with time and maturity.</p><p>1000xResist’s cultural foundation never becomes self-indulgent because it is the critical context that deftly creates a complete and nuanced depiction of why its world came to be. It forms a powerful connection with the Allmother and establishes the disposition for which all the Sisters share. So, to fully understand 1000xResist is to also understand generational trauma, the damage it leaves on its victims, and the ripple effect it has on those around them. Breaking cycles requires radical action, and whether that be ending harmful habits with our loved ones or upending an unjust status quo, this is a story that believes, and demonstrates how, these two must be closely intertwined.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It dissects the immigrant experience to show something greater than simple representation.</p></div><p>There are allusions to the history of Hong Kong protests that are sometimes used as reference for what sets 1000xResist in motion, but like its other parts, that’s only a jumping off point as the story carves its own path. Tales of rebellion and uprising are aplenty in other games since they provide you with clear motivations, but rarely do you see a game walk you through radicalization on such an intimate level – 1000xResist is the perfect example of “show, don’t tell.” It’s masterfully written to appeal to our humanity rather than preach its politics alone, and it’s far more impactful when the onus is on you to really understand what it’s trying to say. That speaks to how effectively the folks at Sunset Visitor wield their real-world influences and lived experiences as a foundation to tell a story that inspires change, and isn’t afraid to show how cruel and heartbreaking that can be.</p><p>1000xResist doesn’t shy away from the complexities, dangers, and unintended consequences of taking action and following through on a just cause. And it’s smart about where it draws its lines in the sand, expertly identifying how fascism manifests in subversive and insidious ways. It’s easy to depict the boot of corrupt and violent systems crushing the powerless, but watching historical revisionism erase what a people once were (and manipulate those around you) is just as chilling to see unfold. So, what happens when those people are pushed to the brink, and the most desperate begin to push back? These are just a few of the concepts that 1000xResist navigates effortlessly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s often dark with an underlying dread lingering over its more broad story elements. However, that wouldn’t work as effectively as it does without the interpersonal dynamics that drive 1000xResist. In just its 12-hour runtime, fully formed characters are created, with rich personalities that anchor the story’s bold themes. Without that heart and soul, there is no inspiration for a revolution, but this is <em>far </em>from the power of friendship trope often used in stories to save the day. These are realistically flawed characters with believable and complicated relationships. Constant tension and skepticism tests their trust in each other as the systems they’ve lived under start to come under question, and during the moments in between are sobering examples of what it takes to be vulnerable with somebody.</p><p>Another impressive aspect is that every single line of dialogue is voiced and delivered with intent. The voice acting doesn’t come across like a star-studded cast reading from a well-rehearsed script, but actual people in my life speaking to me in a natural setting. It trades theatrics for something authentic, and it’s far more effective for what this story is trying to say. This helps ground its sentimentality, so when characters share their own aspirations or open up to each other, there’s a genuine warmth instead of a cloying melodrama. And when they break down from the traumatic experiences they endure, it’s as if I’m there to console one of my own friends. For as dark as things may get, 1000xResist evokes a certain tenderness and levity in the face of tragedy.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Indie Games</h3><p>These are my personal favorites. Don't hate, appreciate.</p></div><p>The fact that the details of this world aren’t delivered through optional journal entries, a codex in the menus, or long-winded exposition is a testament to how 1000xResist is purposeful in its writing and doesn’t waste its breath. But that’s also a credit to the strength of its art direction and visual storytelling. The shot composition of each sequence and the cinematography of its cutscenes communicate so much of what doesn’t need to be outright said. 1000xResist isn’t a graphically impressive game, but it is certainly a visually striking one. Colors are used as a storytelling device, setting the mood without a word by letting them pop in specific instances. Even though it relies on a basic set of animations, the camera work captures the emotions of its characters to emphasize their most important lines, whether it be off-center close-ups or panning environmental shots. Sunset Visitor flips its technical limitations into one of its greatest assets, letting its creative techniques speak as loud as its words.</p><p>“Sometimes, just to miss something is enough.” “You should appreciate people that see you for who you are.” “You must learn to live with the mistakes you’ve made.” Simple one-liners like these powerfully encapsulate the defining moments of 1000xResist. In its melodrama, it inspires self-reflection and asks us to take stock of what we value most. As fleeting or short-lived as our most cherished memories may be, they can still leave a profound impact on us for the rest of our lives. And when we take a step back to reflect on our place in the world, the hope is that they inspire future action.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some rumors have been floating around regarding an early 2025 debut, but these should be taken with a grain of salt. Hopefully, Capcom will make an announcement soon to give us a better time frame.</p> <h2 id="h-what-platforms-will-monster-hunter-wilds-be-on" data-injectable="false">What platforms will Monster Hunter Wilds be on?</h2> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will be available to play on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC</strong>. It’s currently available for wishlist via the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. The Xbox version has yet to make its own store page, so we’ll need to wait for this specific platform.</p>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">As for Switch, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> isn’t currently planned for it. <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-monster-hunter-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> did appear on Switch, but it currently looks like PC and beefier consoles are where <em>Wilds </em>is staying for now.</p> <h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-trailers" data-injectable="false">Monster Hunter Wilds trailers</h2> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">The Game Awards 2023 revealed the very first trailer for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds. </em>It gave us a short sneak peek of various monsters and the formidable Forbidden Lands.</p> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyoBA0aCRNk?start=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">We also see the playable character riding the new mount, Seikret. Not only is this creature used for traveling, but it can be an excellent asset for hunts. You can utilize it to stash away multiple gear, allowing you to heal and equip several weapons.</p> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-a-first-look-at-its-gameplay-in-the-latest-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play 2024</a> also gave us a first look into gameplay.

However, the trailer may hint at this feature, mainly because it includes changing environments.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> page mentions two hunting locales: a formidable location with challenging monsters and a much more peaceful area. Creatures also have designated ecosystems, where you’ll primarily start in the Windward Plains.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="false">Due to these unique environmental attributes, an open-world feature may pan out for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds.</em> We’ll have to wait and see what Capcom confirms.</p>

			<p>Today, Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Little Nightmares III has been delayed to 2025. The developer and publisher jointly shared this message on Twitter/X:</p>

<em>For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025. We'll be sharing more about Little Nightmares III later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.</em></p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last year during Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live. Here's what little we know about Little Nightmares III:</p>
<p><em>In Little Nightmares III, you follow the journey of Low &amp; Alone, as they search for a path that could lead them out of the Nowhere. Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of disturbing places, the two friends will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and escape the grasp of an even greater threat lurking in the shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>For the first time in the franchise, face your childhood fears together with a friend in online co-op, or in solo with an AI companion.</em></p>
<p>Little Nightmares III will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Unofficially, we all know a PC version is likely in the works. Historically, Rockstar has done this many times: Announce a game for consoles, release it, then announce a PC version, and launch that later. But until a <em>GTA 6</em> PC port is officially confirmed and announced, it seems like everyone who works at Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two must be vague  about all of this. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>VGC </em>on May 31</a></span>, when recently asked about <em>GTA 6</em> coming to PC during an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a></span> at a  conference this week, we got this fun word salad from Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement. I guess that could happen, too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone. But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before. And they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time. Okay?</p></blockquote><p>You can definitely read between the lines here and pull from this answer that, yeah, duh, <em>GTA 6</em> is going to get ported to PC. Rockstar always focuses on consoles first, then PC after that. It followed this playbook with <em>GTA V</em> and <em>GTA IV</em>. Zelnick alludes to that by saying “Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before.” </p><p>But again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139">because the industry is obsessed with secrecy</a></span> and holding back every announcement for future events and trailers, Zelnick has to dance around the obvious. You never know when you’ll need to use the announcement of <em>GTA 6</em> on PC as leverage!</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>is set to arrive in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And I bet in 2026 or sooner you’ll get a PC port, just don’t ask anyone at Rockstar or Take-Two about it right now.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It features robot versions of characters from every console generation, and used old console hardware and peripherals as props. It’s evident by just how many references are in its first trailer that <em>Astro Bot </em>is continuing the tradition with a mix of nods to huge PlayStation hits and deep cuts from the brand’s rich past. Here are the characters, consoles, and peripherals we saw in these few minutes of footage.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Right off the bat, we get several references to PlayStation characters in the form of the PlayStation Studios logo screen. Astro leads a stampede of robots, some dressed as PlayStation characters. The menagerie includes <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos and Atreus, Aloy from <em>Horizon</em>, Spike and an ape from <em>Ape Escape</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake, and Ratchet from <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>. Most of these characters will show up again later in the trailer, but it’s not the full extent of the PlayStation heroes that will make an appearance in <em>Astro Bot</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the very first things we see, after being reintroduced to Astro Bot, is a DualSense controller, the PlayStation 5’s next-gen version of the famous Dualshock.

<p data-characters="254" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are countless <em>LEGO </em>sets available to purchase and, if you’re trying to keep to a certain budget, things can get a little complicated. With sets costing hundreds of dollars, it’s not always easy to find an affordable <em>LEGO</em> set to gift or hoard.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">However, as a collector with a child who is also turning into something of a <em>LEGO </em>fan, I’ve had to get thrifty, and I’ve become pretty good at finding <em>LEGO </em>sets on the cheaper side. On this list, I’ve included something for all tastes and the best part? None of these sets sell for more than $50 USD.</p> <h2 id="h-bonsai-tree" data-injectable="false"><strong>Bonsai Tree</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>

Well, almost. You can build one trunk and then have the choice between greenery or Cherry Blossoms to complete the look. I love this set and have it in my bedroom, changing the leaves depending on the season.</p> <h2 id="h-venomized-groot-marvel" data-injectable="false"><strong>Venomized Groot (</strong><strong><em>Marvel</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"><strong>Price: $49.99 USD</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>

You also get a <em>LEGO </em>version of Tom Riddle’s Diary from The Chamber of Secrets, complete with soggy sock, and the cake which results in bars being put on Harry’s window.

Designed by Matthew Aston, it’s a celebration of inclusivity, positivity and kindness. Even if it’s not designed to be played with, this one’s still a pretty cool set to have. Bonus points if you can avoid getting the song stuck in your head.</p> <h2 id="h-dinosaur-fossils-t-rex-skull-jurassic-world" data-injectable="false"><strong>Dinosaur Fossils: T.

 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Even if you’re not that much of a fan of the Jurassic World franchise (though I’m unsure how you couldn’t be, at least when it comes to the original movie), this set looks really nice sitting on a shelf. You get both the T. Rex footprint and fossilized skull to display, as well as a small plaque relaying details about real-life T.

It’s actually pretty big, standing at 15 inches tall, so it’s replaced the real plant on my dining table. I can attest that, as someone who is terrible at keeping houseplants alive, <em>LEGO </em>flowers are an excellent alternative!</p>

		<p>Nacon is set to take a shot at the sim racing world, announcing the development of its first steering wheel peripherals and the formation of a new department dedicated to racing.</p>
<p>The French publisher and game accessories maker is building the new racing department around KT Racing on the game development side – currently hard at work finishing development of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown – and a new Revosim premium brand that will include Nacon’s first steering wheel.</p>


<p>Revosim will check all the boxes for a modern high-end racing wheel with a direct drive motor, a GT steering wheel design, and a set of pedals with a load cell for braking.</p>
<p>Details on pricing and availability have yet to be announced, but the Revosim will be going up against the best of Thrustmaster, Logitech, Fanatec and more boutique wheel manufacturers. It’s a potentially difficult market to crack, but new contenders are always welcome.</p>
<p>The racing department is being led by Sébastien Waxin, who has been in charge of Nacon’s racing game catalogue of over a decade. For the announcement he said, “We are proud to be presenting, for the first time, the prototype of our first premium racing wheel during Bigben Week. Its development represents a natural step in the evolution of NACON’s expertise, epitomised by the new brand Revosim, which combines the company’s many years of experience in racing simulations with the flagship Revolution accessories brand. We are looking forward to revealing the technical details of the steering wheel in the coming months.”</p>

<p>Nacon is a well established brand for third party gaming peripherals. The RIG gaming headsets have their distinctive industrial style combined with high quality audio, there’s an ever-evolving set of pro controllers for PlayStation and Xbox, keyboards and mice for PC, arcade sticks and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-games-coming-out-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Keeping track of all the latest video games coming out is an increasingly complex task, what with multiple PC storefronts, Xbox One, PS4, Switch, mobile, and more to keep track of, but don’t worry, I’m here to help. Every month I'll be running down the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/games-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games you need to be keeping an eye on</a>, from the big triple-A headliners, to the intriguing indies you might overlook.</p>
<p>June is sure to be a big month for video game news, but it isn’t that big in terms of actual releases. That said, there are still a few promising things coming, including Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Atlus' big revamp of Shin Megami Tensei V. Meanwhile, on the indie front, players can look forward to the atmospheric horror game Still Wakes the Deep, stylish dungeon crawler #BLUD, and more. Oh, and we don't cover DLC in these articles, but still, I feel like I should at least quickly mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is coming out on June 21.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> While I may have played demos or got early access to some of the games recommended in this article, in most cases I’m simply choosing games that look promising, and can’t vouch for the end product. Do wait for reviews before buying! </em></p>
<p>That said, here are the games you should be looking out for in June…</p>
<h2><strong>The Headliners</strong></h2>
<p><iframe title="Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance - Official 'The Ultimate Beginning' Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edeihC8xHt0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance (PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 &amp; Switch, June 14)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shin-megami-tensei-v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> originally came and went without too much fanfare as a Switch exclusive back in 2021, but now Atlus is giving the game another chance to shine. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance not only totally revamps the game’s presentation for more powerful platforms, but adds an entire second story path, new areas, demons, and more. Atlus considers this the new standard version of SMTV, going so far as to remove the older Switch version from sale. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWN2RMFT/?tag=wccftech0a9-20">pre-order Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD (Switch, June 27)</strong></p>
<p>Continuing our theme of underappreciated games getting another shot, in between the original Luigi’s Mansion and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-3-bustin-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, Nintendo released the 3DS-exclusive Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon. It was a very ambitious game by 3DS standards, and now it’s getting a full Switch revival under the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a>. Rev up your Poltergust and check out the Luigi’s Mansion game you may have missed out on. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYPPRX3N/?tag=wccftech0a9-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Promising Indies</strong></h2>
<p><iframe title="#BLUD - Official Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Eu6q2V3i5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#BLUD (PC, June 18)</strong></p>
<p>Looking for a Diablo-esque dungeon crawler without &nbsp;all the darkness and gloom? Well, then #BLUD might be for you. The game combines dungeon crawling with lively Nickelodeon-style animation (and some violence you wouldn’t see on Nick). Oh, yeah, and there’s vampires, too! Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921480/BLUD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for #BLUD</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Still Wakes the Deep - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGz5zvgCOEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Still Wakes the Deep (PC, Xbox Series X/S &amp; PS5, June 18)</strong></p>
<p>A good setting can make or break a horror story, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, set on a massive isolated deep sea oil rig off the coast of Scotland, has a great one. Developed by Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room, Still Wakes the Deep has some atmospheric walking-sim-style elements to it, but it also looks to serve up plenty of intense moments of survival and otherworldly horror. This is indie horror amped up. Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Still Wakes the Deep</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Until Then - Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDCwoJQrAOY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Until Then (PC &amp; PS5, June 25)</strong></p>
<p>Until Then is a gorgeously hand-crafted 2D narrative adventure that aims to immerse players in the dramatic world of high school kids living in the Philippines. You’ll be doing more than just chilling out though, as the game also weaves in magical and mystery elements to draw the story along. Video games can transport you like few other mediums, and this looks like a journey worth taking. Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Until Then</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Times &amp; Galaxy (PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5 &amp; Switch, June 21)</strong></p>
<p>As somebody who’s spent 15 years writing for a living, I can assure you it isn’t always that exciting, but I must admit, Times &amp; Galaxy looks to do a pretty good job of making journalism entertaining. For starters, the game takes place in a fun sci-fi setting and features a “build-a-story” mechanic that turns writing into a sort of fun puzzle (if only it was really like that!) Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/883230/Times_and_Galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page for Times &amp; Galaxy</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hellblade-2-patch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-hellblade-2-patch-addresses-ghosting-issues-improves-fsr3-artifacts-alongside-numerous-other-fixes.886620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hellblade-2-patch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ninja Theory has deployed a new Hellblade 2 patch, packing fixes for several issues, including frame generation ghosting issues, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch is a minor one for Ninja Theory's recently released Hellblade sequel, but one that will be welcomed by fans nonetheless. Aside from the aforementioned fixes for frame generation issues, this new update improves FSR3 artifacts, addresses some crashing issues, and fixes some encountered memory leaks. In addition, the update fixes missing captions as well as facial animations, and adds a warning prompt when selecting ‘New Story’ (this option resets the current save's story progress).&nbsp;You can find the full release notes for this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/4166471769756034428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade 2 patch here</a>.</p>
<p>Hellblade 2 is available worldwide now across PC and Xbox. The game is also available through Game Pass. Here's what we wrote about this great-looking sequel to 2017's Hellblade in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> earlier this month:</p>
<p><em>"On that note, Ninja Theory will assuredly get their latest work in the hands of many more users, which is great for this type of experience. However, I'm not so sure Microsoft will be just as happy with the return on investment, especially since Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is otherwise sold at $49 (instead of the original's $29) and is unlikely to set sales charts on fire. I expect Microsoft&nbsp;will eventually release it on PlayStation consoles&nbsp;to maximize profits.</em></p>
<p><em>I still have to discuss the audiovisual department. There's not much to say here except that it is absolutely stellar. Unreal Engine 5 is used to its full extent, with Nanite making a particularly impressive showcase of its virtual geometry in the impressive rendering of Iceland's rocky environments. The atmosphere and lighting are fantastic, although I found certain scenes to be a bit too dark, to the point where you literally had to increase the gamma to see anything."</em></p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24168219/longlegs-director-preview-nicolas-cage-serial-killer-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/longlegs%E2%80%99-director-on-what-the-horror-movie%E2%80%99s-viral-marketing-campaign-is-hiding.886617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168219/longlegs-director-preview-nicolas-cage-serial-killer-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="m2X4Rj">If you’ve seen anything about <em>Longlegs</em>, from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24055798/longlegs-horror-movie-trailer-teaser-release">cryptic teasers to its spooky trailer</a>, you probably know it’s an upcoming horror movie about a serial killer played by Nicolas Cage. You also probably don’t know much else. </p>
<p id="FHiSSP">The trailer has elements that certainly feel recognizable, like a young female FBI agent investigating a notorious serial killer, but there’s an overwhelming sense of unease and mystery that leaves the whole thing feeling just a little bit off, enhancing the creepiness and unfamiliarity. And according to director Oz Perkins, that’s very much by design. </p>
<p id="PqWxRL">Perkins describes <em>Longlegs </em>as a “pop-punk, nostalgic serial killer movie with a supernatural flavor,” but he didn’t want to throw all that at audiences right away. </p>
<p id="s17SK6">“[I] used things like <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, <em>Se7en</em>, and <em>Zodiac </em>as kind of primers,” Perkins says. “So the audience sees those clues, or those cues, and says, <em>OK, I understand how this will work.</em>”<em> </em></p>

<p id="yCZ1cS">But these cinematic touchstones are more like starting points than destinations for Perkins, a veteran horror filmmaker whose past work, like <em>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</em> and <em>Gretel &amp; Hansel</em>, has proven popular in the world of arthouse horror but never quite broken into the mainstream. </p>
<p id="jxHTVM">“It’s meant to be easier on an audience to connect with it. So that when it gets funky, and it does get funky, we’ve kind of earned it,” Perkins explains. “It’s more playful at that point. I think in previous movies, I think I’ve gotten a little opaque. [...] Now I want to make something that more people will enjoy, and will give me more latitude to do what I want, so it starts with something more familiar.”</p>
<p id="rNXipH">Perkins’ work on the movie started with the character of Longlegs, who had been figuratively lurking in the background and at the edges of some of his previous stories and ideas. He said he knew certain things about the character, but compared it to seeing the back of someone who looks familiar as they leave a convenience store: You’re so positive you know them, but you can never be totally sure — a terrifying description for a character that would later become a serial killer. </p>
<p id="ZMk3CA">“I knew that he drove up to people’s houses, on their birthdays, or on their kids’ birthdays,” Perkins says. “And he brought with him sort of, maybe, stuffed animals? He was a clown or a singer or magician or performer or something.”</p>
<div id="YqjI2J"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OG7wOTE8NhE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="rDcGgL">But turning that vague idea of a character into something to center a movie around proved to be more of a puzzle for Perkins. He says he worked it out like a crossword puzzle, understanding the shape and space he had allotted, then fitting in the details that would make the movie work and make it accessible for audiences, like turning Longlegs into a serial killer, or centering the movie on a young FBI agent to pull in a <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> homage — a movie he says made a huge impression on him as a kid. </p>
<p id="80GtH5">Another key piece of the puzzle for Perkins was adding Nicolas Cage to the project as the serial killer in question. Perkins says Cage read the script and loved it, and that he brings an undeniably unique energy to all his characters. It was Perkins’ job to find a way to channel that energy. </p>
<p id="cqXDzl">“There’s no version where I’m going to try to change him into something that he’s not, or try to diffuse what he’s going to bring,” Perkins explains. “You don’t get Nicolas Cage in your picture unless you want what he’s going to bring. You kind of just wait and see what it is. And you have faith and trust that it’s going to be right. And in this case, it really is.”</p>

<p id="dt3v65">As for where the story of <em>Longlegs </em>goes after the familiar setup, Perkins didn’t offer many details, preferring to save the surprises for when people can see the movie for themselves. However, he did offer up the tantalizing note that David Lynch is a particularly big inspiration for him. </p>
<p id="ZrOzQV">“<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23298759/twin-peaks-movie-fire-walk-with-me-anniversary-criterion"><em>Fire Walk with Me</em></a> was really important to me,” he says. “I feel like the tempo, the environment, the cadence of things, the world, those things are really deep in my psyche and I think they probably come in the wash a bit.” </p>
<p id="uvPY6t">One thing Perkins does make clear is that viewers are best off experiencing all of <em>Longlegs</em>’ twists and surprises in a theater if they can. </p>
<p id="mTrjWC">“We are hiding something under a veil,” Perkins teases. “We are hiding something under a curtain and it’s more fun to pull the sheet off when there’s a lot of people watching. It’s kind of like, <em>Gather around so we can reveal the Elephant Man.</em> And I think doing that in a room with people, in an immersive experience of the theater — I’m proud to have made a movie that works well that way.”</p>

Summer is here. Pride month is here. And we’re taking the time this weekend to cram in some more gaming with a few recent titles, a wonderful indie game from a couple of years ago, the return of a GameCube title from 2004, and more. </p><p>If you’re in search of something to play this weekend, we invite you to consider these fine gaming experiences. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-recommend-id="image://0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Nine Sols fights a much taller enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Nine Sols fights a much taller enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->RedCandleGames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-recommend-id="image://0f99d61ec65307fbb2dc10a222605df7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Nine Sols fights a much taller enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV*)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get lost in its gorgeous Taopunk world</p></div><p><em>Nine Sols </em>strikes me as an interesting follow-up to Red Candle Games’ previous work in the horror genre, with <em>Detention </em>and then <em>Devotion</em>, but I’m here for it. The studio’s been quiet about the game for a long time now, sparingly offering up updates over the last year, but it’s finally here and I’m relishing the chance to play it all weekend. Inspired by Taoism, but mechanically akin to a 2D <em>Sekiro</em>, I’ve been stoked on <em>Nine Sols</em>’ blending of faith, mythology and a grim sci-fi world since I first saw it. A demo from a year ago assured me of its mechanics, and now that it’s in my hand, I’m finally able to lose myself in <em>Nine Sols</em> and parry my way through its gorgeously rendered world. Just as soon as I finish <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, though. – Moises Taveras<br></p><p><em>*Your mileage may vary</em></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-recommend-id="image://76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-recommend-id="image://76311a491685f548eb557c5467892d46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith run through the town of Kalm as mountains loom in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This game burned me out bad, man. My most anticipated release of 2024,<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> quickly exhausted my hype levels. I went hard the first weekend it came out, played several evenings afterwards, and then drifted to playing once or twice a week. I reached peak enjoyment while perfecting my timing during the Shinra parade in Junon, and quickly hit a wall upon arriving in Costa Del Sol. It’s not that I ever stopped enjoying the game—my momentum just kind of fizzled. Tons of other stuff came out. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>was much easier to drop in and out of during spare moments here and there. More recently, <em>Diablo IV</em>’s been serving as that end-of-evening brain-off respite. But I really want to finish <em>Rebirth</em>. I need to finish<em> Rebirth</em>. So this weekend I’m going to try to mainline the story as much as possible before the endless mini-games and open-world side activities once again grind things to a halt. I love that stuff, but I can’t wait 100 hours to see this ending everyone hates so much. At least nothing’s coming out next month to get in my way. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-recommend-id="image://d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Cicada Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-recommend-id="image://d1f66bf4b646c1a0535bb5c4f4a269b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character navigates an icey environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Switch,<strong> </strong>Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Stars! MORE STARS!</p></div><p>If you asked me if I needed another block-pushing puzzle game in my life, I’d likely have just shaken my head and walked away. I don’t know what caused me to even load up <em>Isles of Sea &amp; Sky</em>, given its Sokobanish stylings, but I’m ever so glad I did.</p><p>This is far more than standard block-pushing. This is a vast, ever-expanding world of islands to explore, each packed with unique puzzles, often solvable in two or three different ways for different rewards. It has heavy <em>A Link to the Past</em> undertones, while never feeling like it’s leaning on <em>Zelda</em> as an inspiration, instead possessing its own unique character. Each island has a sort of deity-like being that needs you to find six of at least a dozen tokens, which will then unlock new blocks that allow you to re-approach the area’s puzzles using new skills. For instance, the second island you’ll likely explore has specific blue blocks that are eventually transformed into gorgeous little blue sprites, who will take on the properties of any block they’re shoved into. This obviously has enormous consequences on puzzles you couldn’t solve before, and offers new ways to approach those you could to reach a different prize.</p><p>I really, really thought I was done with this genre, usually finding the nature of sokoban puzzles—where you’re endlessly finding yourself in dead-ends—to be far too frustrating, but <em>Isles of Sea &amp; Sky</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://islesofseaandsky.com/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://islesofseaandsky.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">once known as <em>Akurra</em></a></span>) removes all of this with single-button taps to take back any move, and another tap to reset a location.

I felt a bit of this concern before diving back into one of my all-time favorite games, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, via its brand-new remake on the Switch. I needn’t have worried, though. If anything, what I’m finding is that it’s even better than I remembered.</p><p>Everywhere I go, the writing is so funny, so sparkling, so heartfelt, that I’m deliberately talking to every last minor NPC because I don’t want to miss a word. For me, that delightful writing and the wonderful cast of characters you meet remain the game’s biggest draws, but the game shines elsewhere, too. Navigating the world, and using Mario’s ever-increasing assortment of abilities—err, I mean terrible curses—to find secrets and access new areas, is a delight, and the combat hits that sweet spot of being accessible to genre newcomers and deep enough to keep you engaged. But yes, come for the writing, and the game’s endearing papercraft visuals, which look better than ever on the Switch. You won’t be disappointed. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-recommend-id="image://17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->rose-engine / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-recommend-id="image://17bff8252dae454cd72f1f547a2b5fbe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Signalis takes aim at enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5,<strong> </strong>PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Just enjoy it</p></div><p>Ever since I reviewed the retro-inspired horror game<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span> at the beginning of May (and found it lacking), I’ve been itching to revisit 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/signalis-survival-horror-impressions-review-pc-ps4-xbox-1849730503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/signalis-survival-horror-impressions-review-pc-ps4-xbox-1849730503"><em>Signalis</em></a></span>. The first game from the two-person team Rose Engine was one of my favorite of the year, and it’s never quite left my mind since. Like <em>Crow Country</em>, <em>Signalis </em>is a survival horror game that visually and mechanically pulls heavily from the PlayStation 1 games that defined the genre (think <em>Silent Hill </em>and <em>Resident Evil</em>). Where the two differ, however, is in execution. </p><p><br><em>Signalis </em>is one of those rare retro-inspired games that so intrinsically understands what makes its inspirations tick, and is able to not only recreate their greatness but build on it. The game follows android LSTR as she seeks to find her partner in the abandoned halls of a mining facility, now overrun with zombie-like creatures. Through item scarcity, inventory management and puzzles, the player must go deeper into the facility as you learn what caused a mysterious disease now running rampant. On top of the excellent use of tension is a wonderfully twisting story about love, and it’s pretty excellent. <em>Signalis </em>is a game that constantly rewards revisiting its world and I can’t wait to see what new things I pick up on this time around. – Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-recommend-id="image://5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Player First Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-recommend-id="image://5ea06bfb9c03a0942b75c3b21d69920e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters from Adventure Time stand next to a strange beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Figure out if I actually like this game or not</p></div><p>I don’t like most platform fighters, and I don’t think WB’s crossover brawler <em>Multiversus </em>is going to be any different.

<p>PlayStation might have some announcements during Summer Games Fest 2024, it’s been claimed.</p>



<p>Renowned tipster, <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796320512081354980">Midori</a>, known for their scoops related to SEGA and Nintendo, recently tweeted about PlayStation attending Summer Game Fest. The post informed players that more information regarding “Metaphor: ReFantazio and Sonic X Shadow Generations” will be relayed during the Summer Game Fest. Adding to this, Midori stated that we can expect announcements on “more titles from SIE studios too”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is hard to know what PlayStation will showcase at the event, as they have only revealed that they will be at the event in some capacity. However, we speculate that it could be the game that LEGO and PlayStation are collaborating to create, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a>, which was exclusively reported by Insider Gaming earlier this month. The game should be similar to what we have seen in their Star Wars, Marvel, DC, and other Traveller’s Tale series of games. Sources previously revealed that the game would be “Horizon Forbidden West but LEGO.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other than that, players are hoping that we might receive something from Sucker Punch, maybe a reveal for Ghost of Tsushima 2. Geoff Keighley also has a close relationship with Kojima, so we might get another glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a>. In addition, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-officially-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astrobot pre-orders</a> are set to go live on June 7, so another look at the game could be on hand during the main show.</p>



<div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment recently hosted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, which included a series of announcements and reveals such as Astro Boy, Concord, God of War: Ragnarok PC release date and a bunch more for PSVR 2 too. It seems this dedicated event was probably not long enough for them to provide us with updates on all of their projects. Which could be a reason enough to take the stage during Summer Game Fest 2024. </p><p>What do you think PlayStation could be cooking up for Summer Game Fest in 2024?</p></div>

<p>Battlestate Games has just revealed that the next global wipe event in Escape from Tarkov will take place in August, making it one of the longest durations between wipes in the game’s history. This reveal took place today on the TarkovTV broadcast, during which Nikita Buyanov shared plenty of information about what’s coming next, ranging from new weapons to hideout expansions – and much more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-next-wipe-is-still-months-away">Tarkov’s Next Wipe is Still Months Away</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has had a tough time of it of late. The game has been the subject of much controversy, particularly with Battlestate Games introducing a brand-new edition of the game that was deemed ‘pay-to-win’ and borderline disrespectful to existing players. In recent weeks, the team at Battlestate Games has tried to make amends, including leaning more actively into community feedback to make Escape from Tarkov ‘better’.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of TarkovTV, Nikita Buyanov revealed that the patch that’ll bring the next wipe is dropping in August 2024. He didn’t specify a date, but referenced that it would be ‘early August’. The last wipe was in December, so it’s a lengthy gap – one of the longest between wipes in Tarkov history.</p>



<p>Here are some other tidbits coming to Tarkov per the showcase:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bipods</li>



<li>New weapons (M60)</li>



<li>Hideout areas</li>



<li>Mannequins and more display mechanics in the Hideout</li>



<li>A new secure stash box</li>



<li>New apparel</li>



<li>Crossovers between Arena and Escape from Tarkov</li>



<li>‘Arena Boxes’ – loot boxes, essentially</li>



<li>Factory rework</li>



<li>Tripwires and landmines (both AI and players) on containers and dead bodies</li>



<li>PMC Karma</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s plenty more coming – so stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anger-foot-is-like-john-wick-with-some-extra-kick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hands-on with the frantic first-person shooter that brings new meaning to the term foot soldier.</h2></div><section><p>Fast-paced first-person shooters may be a dime a dozen these days, but Anger Foot has a unique gameplay hook that is literally kicking the door down for your attention. This colourful and completely chaotic shooter from the makers of Broforce is like a first-person take on the compelling, room-clearing carnage of Hotline Miami, with an emphasis on using your left foot of fury to violently smash a path through locked doors, obstacles, and gangs of anthropomorphic animal enemies. It’s a shoot and boot ‘em up that feels like John Wick with some extra kick, and I enjoyed the two hours I spent playing an early build of Anger Foot every skull-stomping step of the way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are guns too, of course, but the pistol in your hand is merely a support act to the size 12 snuffer of life at the end of your left leg. There’s no ammunition to pick up and reload, instead once you’ve run out of rounds to chamber you just throw your empty gun at an enemy to stun them, jump-kick them into next week, and catch their freshly dropped uzi or shotgun before carrying on your merry, murderous way. Enemies can be booted directly into their friends behind them like dim-witted dominoes, and there’s never any shortage of explosive gas canisters or oil barrels to be found in each gang den you crash through, allowing for spectacular chain reaction kills – or your own instant death should you accidently shoot them at close quarters.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The pistol in your hand is merely a support act to the size 12 snuffer of life at the end of your left leg.</p></div><p>In fact, I’ve died a lot during the two-dozen levels I’ve played so far, since you’re every bit as vulnerable to one-shotted deaths as the enemies around you. A continually shuffling roster of enemy types and combinations meant that Anger Foot consistently kept me on my anger toes, forcing me to find new strategies to most efficiently deal with each new threat. When riot gear clad birds arrived I started firing off a round to make them reflexively raise their shields so that I could run in and boot their bulletproof barriers straight back into their beaks. Meanwhile I was delighted to find that the grenades thrown by puffer jacket-clad goons could be volleyed back at them with a well-timed kick, forcing them to watch their own bomb blow up in their faces like they were the producers of the Madame Web movie.      </p><p>Surviving all the way to each level exit earns you a star, but there are a further two stars to claim per level for optional challenges such as completing a level within a stricter time limit, or killing a certain number of enemies using only your foot. Some of these additional objectives seem seriously challenging, and although each level only takes a couple of minutes to complete I can see myself spending hours trying to earn all the stars in the finished game – although I don’t know how I’m supposed to beat a level in under 30 seconds when I keep getting distracted by the playable Broforce arcade machines found along the way. </p><p>The more stars you earn, the more special shoes you can unlock and lace up, with each pair of kicks granting you a unique gameplay buff not unlike the animal masks from Hotline Miami. You might strap on a pair of high tops that earns you a precious round of ammo for every bad guy you boot in the face, or slip into a pair of sneakers that activates a big head mode to make it easier to headshot enemies from long range. I also found footwear that could charge up kicks into room-clearing dash attacks, as well as another pair that let me come back from the dead once per level. Talk about a sole revival!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Anger Foot Screens</h3></div></output><p>I also unlocked a slightly embarrassing pair of socks with sandals that allowed me to deal extra damage during boss fights, although this did mean that I was able to easily stomp out Anger Foot’s first major boss like it was a house spider under a work boot. Given how tricky the levels that preceded it were, including one against an unseen sniper that instantly snuffed out my sprints between cover, it seemed slightly disappointing to dispatch the leader of the Violence Gang with a mere handful of half-hearted highkicks. Hopefully there’ll be some heavier head honchos to contend with in the three other gangs to take down in Anger Foot – namely the Pollution Gang found in the sewers, the Business Gang found in the high rises, and the Debauchery Gang found in… I don’t know, one of P. Diddy’s mansions, probably.  </p><p>Basic boss fights aside, Anger Foot’s evolving combat and cartoonish charm kept a goofy grin on my face during my playtime, and its rousing, bass-heavy techno groove had me tapping my toes while I was capping my foes – from rooftop shootouts with heavily-armed gangbangers to subterranean stoushes with snakes and giant squid tentacles in the sewers below. It remains to be seen if the instantly gratifying action of Anger Foot will have the anger legs to go the distance in the finished game, but based on what I’ve played so far it seems like this is one frantic first-person shooter that’s truly putting its best foot forward.</p><p><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Editor in IGN's Sydney office.

"But the reality is no one has tried it. If you create an enormous role-playing game, for example, with 100 or 150 hours of gameplay, very polished, and a unique experience, would the consumer be willing to pay more? If they would, they would have more products potentially coming to market. But no one tried it.</p><p>"It's something we have been discussing, but we are currently sticking to the practice of the industry. Would it be that one [company] one day that tries to increase pricing? That remains to be seen."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/lars-wingefors-001-1713775735682-1717170527566.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>EMBRACER CEO LARS WINGEFORS. IMAGE CREDIT: EMBRACER GROUP.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>The triple-A video game industry collectively raised the price of its video games with the launch of the current console generation in 2020, but in recent months the $70 price point has become the topic of much discussion amid the industry’s ongoing struggles. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamers-mostly-played-older-games-like-gta-5-and-fortnite-in-2023">Recent data points to gamers tending to favor older, live service games</a>, such as Fortnite, Roblox, and Call of Duty, leaving less room for new, full price games.</p><p>Indeed, Embracer has seen a number of high-profile flops, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-flopped-embracer-says-after-laying-off-staff">including the recently released horror revival Alone in the Dark</a>, which Wingefors said was “a big investment” that “didn't catch enough consumers”.</p><p>"I think the industry is facing the same problem as all other industries, with inflation and rising costs of game development," Wingefors added. "And it's been hard to increase pricing [in] premium PC/console. The pricing of those products has been the same for many years, which means that the margin to succeed is less, and on top of that, there is a higher cost of capital. Ultimately when you make big investments or games, you need to play with teams you are very confident in, or with IPs you own or control, and have the full financial income.</p><p>"On top of that, the consumers have more content than ever to choose from. They love to engage in established IPs they've been playing before, which means it's harder to have them trying out new things or new IPs. It's just something we're all facing. It's a reality which we have been adapting to over the past year, and we will continue to adapt to that reality."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The pricing of those products has been the same for many years...</p></div><p>Wingefors’ comments suggest Embracer is waiting for another video game company to go first, essentially, before it follows suit with a price hike. But what company could justify such a move, which would likely be met with a backlash from gamers?</p><p>Rockstar is currently the subject of debate around this topic, with the Take-Two-owned company preparing to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> late 2025. Rockstar has yet to announce a price for GTA 6, or how the game will be sold, but there are few other games that would move the needle quite as much as this behemoth.</p><p>In November 2023, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said video game frontline prices “are still very, very low” compared to other forms of entertainment “because we offer many hours of engagement”.</p><p>“The value of the engagement is very high,” Zelnick added. “So, I think the industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power. However, there is a great deal of value offered.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
