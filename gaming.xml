		<p>Publisher Microids and developer Fishing Cactus have confirmed that Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean remake will be releasing on May 18th for PC. The previously announced console versions are nowhere in sight however. Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean was originally released in 1999, tasking players with controlling the Caribbean sea using might and trade as a privateer. A new gameplay trailer has been released so you can see the game in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Corsairs – Battle of the Caribbean – Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bg7sZr-phRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean will have a campaign mode in which you can play as five factions, each with their own ambitions. There is also online multiplayer for up to four players, and a brand new Skirmish mode so players can jump right into the action. The multiplayer has an Elo-based ranking system so players are matched with people similar to their own skill and rank. Players can build fleets made up of 12 different ship, including unique faction ships, and use three different types of ammo in naval battles. There is also boarding between ships with player’s soldiers consisting of three classes, with those being Gunner, Agile, and Tank.</p>
<p>In Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean players will also need to manage trade across the territory, and keep sailing to find new resources and islands to claim. Cities will provide additional bonuses for players as trade grows, and new upgrades for the fleet can be discovered through sailing around the map and completing quests. A price for the game is yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>It appears that a leak in <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> may have inadvertently revealed the launch date of <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> well ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next week's <strong>Xbox Developer Direct show</strong></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to X user XBOXF10</a>, a pop-up ad revealed that the game will launch on May 19, although early access will start four days early for those who pre-purchase the Premium Edition or get the Premium Upgrade. </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Pre-order now and get a pre-tuned and exclusive Ferrari J50 in Forza Horizon 6!</em> <em>Discover the breathtaking landscapes of Japan in over 550 real-world cars and become a racing Legend in Forza Horizon's biggest open world driving adventure yet.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Pre-order Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition or get the Premium Upgrade featuring:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Early Access - Play 4 days early, starting May 15</em></li>



<li><em>VIP Membership</em></li>

<li><em>Time Attack Car Pack</em></li>



<li><em>Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)</em></li>



<li><em>2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</em></li>
</ul>



<p>This date follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier rumor from insider Nate the Hate</a>, who claimed that the British developer was targeting the <strong>first half of 2026</strong> for Forza Horizon 6. The studio's other big game slated to appear at the Xbox Developer Direct, <strong>Fable</strong>, might then target a Fall 2026 window.</p>



<p>The sixth entry in the Forza Horizon franchise comes on the heels of the incredible success and acclaim of the fifth installment, which registered <strong>over 50 million players</strong> to date and performed very well even on PlayStation 5. Forza Horizon may have started as an open world arcade spin-off of Forza Motorsport, but over time, it far surpassed Turn 10's more regular race-based simcade series. Now, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Turn 10 layoffs</a>, it is believed that the developer based in Redmond, Washington, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has essentially become a support team for FH</a>, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and will feature <strong>a fantastic open world experience for fans</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased a while ago by the developers</a>. It will be released for PC and Xbox Series S and X consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per the original announcement</a>, with a PlayStation 5 version coming at a later date.</p>

<figcaption>Bobby Kotick seems to be pointing the finger at Embracer Group and Emma Ihre over a lawsuit.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Kotick's reasoning regarding Embracer's desire to hurt Activision involves the two companies releasing what he considers to be similar games at similar times, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-island-2-release-date-moved-to-april" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3ec9c2d-facf-442a-974a-8f5fa5d1240e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, <em>Insurgency</em>, and <em>Remnant 2 </em>(which Kotick says have similarities to <em>Call of Duty </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-blizzard-deep-dive-breaks-down-diablo-iv-release-date-trailer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8a9c064f-770c-42b5-a1a7-d8ea93c11706" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo IV</em></a>, respectively).</p><p>The lawsuit in question was brought against Kotick and his former companies in 2022 by AP7. It alleges that Kotick rushed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca03cb11-0e22-42e4-bb57-2d2f082d977b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sale of Activision Blizzard to Microsoft</a> in 2021 in order to dodge the consequences of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employee-speaks-out-about-sexual-harassment" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="377898d2-bd83-41f5-9293-7f03ef9de06f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">numerous</a> sexual harassment <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-new-explosive-allegations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="37853141-4a88-4074-b619-4cc60e7ad075" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">allegations</a>.</p><p>Indeed, Kotick goes one step further and suggests that the "narrative" of those allegations was "false", and that AP7 was aided in its lawsuit by "activists" who "brought false and wholly unsubstantiated claims against Activision and Mr. Kotick".</p><p>Embracer, for its own part, was quick to respond to The Game File and Totilo. The company told Totilo that it was "humbled" by Kotick's claims, but that it "did not and [does] not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision". Claws out, eh?</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anthem-single-player-offline-mode-bioware-ea-mark-darrah-2000659773</link>
            <guid>1405711</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>been officially wiped off the face of the Earth</span></a><span> for two days now, and Mark Darrah, an ex-BioWare producer who worked on both the ill-fated looter shooter and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>, has released a nearly four-hour postmortem on the game and how it all went wrong. If you care at all about the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>RPG developer’s odd live-service detour</span></a><span>, it’s a pretty interesting watch, but there’s one thing of note we’re going to focus on: </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could have had local servers that would have allowed it to live on even after EA had abandoned it.</span></p>  <p><span>At the end of Darrah’s video, he starts to give a soft pitch for how </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could live on and maybe even see a bit of that fabled </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky </span></i><span>redemption arc that BioWare was hoping for when it announced it was revamping the game in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>He says that his idea would “conservatively” run EA about $10 million, and if that should sell more than 400,000 copies, it could actually work out for everyone involved. To start, he suggests moving </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> to current-gen consoles, rather than leaving it on PS4 and Xbox One, and using locally-hosted servers. Apparently, BioWare had local servers running in a development environment “up until a few months before launch,” and while he doesn’t know if they still work, the code is there and can be recovered.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The reason you do this, it pulls away the cost of maintaining this game,” Darrah says. “So rather than having dedicated servers that are required for the game to run, you let the server run on one of the machines that’s playing the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Hearing that BioWare, at some point in development, had the tools in place to save </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> from its fate actually gives me a mix of sadness and anger for the devs and fans who wanted the game to go on existing, even if it wasn’t going to be supported with future updates. BioWare’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618"><span>reasoning for shutting the game down without an offline mode</span></a><span> was that it was “designed to be an online-only title,” but now we know that there were, at one time, tools in place to remove all the server costs from EA’s shoulders, and that it just chose not to use them. Killing the game off is certainly the more straightforward approach, but it’s also far more destructive.</span></p>

 <p><span>Darrah goes on to suggest that most of the hypothetical $10 million budget would go into making </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> a single-player game, which would require creating AI party members to accommodate the game’s combat encounters which are balanced for multiple players. He suggests either promoting some of the NPCs to companions, or just making three to five new characters that could go through the existing story alongside you with their own stories. He even says that if EA really wanted to do it for cheap, go with the bare minimum amount of new party members by capping it at three so they just fill out your four-player party.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“If you can do those two things and turn the local servers on and give them a little bit of their own storytelling, that what you have essentially reverse-engineered is a BioWare game without romances with a decent BioWare-style story with companions that can be played as a single-player game,” Darrah says. “And I think there are a significant number of people who enjoy BioWare stories who did not play </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> because they didn’t want to play a multiplayer looter shooter who would be interested enough in seeing that story to pick that game up and give it a try.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As nice as it sounds, Darrah says he has no faith that EA would do something like this, even if it were a relatively cheap lift compared to running the servers forever. It’s annoying to know that </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could still have lived on in some form, but at least we know definitively that EA and BioWare pissed in our ears and told us it was raining.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ImperialHal Faces Controller Ban 12 Hours Before ALGS Championship]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/imperialhal-controller-ban-algs-championship/</link>
            <guid>1405708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series 2026 Championship is set to take place tomorrow in Sapporo, Japan. Today, one of the game’s most prolific pro players, ImperialHal, revealed that his first-choice controller was <strong>banned </strong>and won’t be usable in the event. For a pro player, that’s one of the most critical changes to make at the last minute.</p>



<p>ImperialHal, who flies the Team Falcons banner, posted on social media that it has ‘got to be a joke, surely.’</p>







<h2 id="h-imperialhal-s-zd-ultimate-controller-is-banned">ImperialHal’s ZD Ultimate Controller is Banned</h2>



<p>The ALGS regulators have decided to <strong>ban </strong>ImperialHal’s chief controller, the ZD Ultimate, just one day before the ALGS Championship tournament takes place in Japan.</p>



<p>The ZD Ultimate is a lesser-known controller that boasts stacks of bonus features, including tri-connectivity, ultra-low latency, trigger switches, back paddles, extra buttons, and an RGB light strip. It currently costs $99.99 from the manufacturer.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, ImperialHal explained why it’s banned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because it has wireless capabilities that can be changed at any point via mobile and macro stuff that can’t be disabled.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also pointed out that during the Esports World Cup, ‘multiple players’ used controllers with similar functions, and they weren’t banned.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My controller gets banned the day before 2 million Dollar tournament 😂😂😂</p><p>Gotta be a joke surely</p></div>— Falcons ImperialHal (@ImperialHal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialHal/status/2011411052261699976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>ImperialHal has been competing in the Apex Legends space since 2019, making a name for himself while flying the TSM flag, but in 2024, he picked up a spot on Team Falcons’ developing roster. In 2023, he secured the top spot at the ALGS Championship, and a year later, hit a second-place finish at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Last year produced a third-place finish at the ALGS Championship, so this is something of a redemption opportunity for the 26-year-old esports pro.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s right that the organizers banned ImperialHal’s controller so close to the start of the tournament? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Actor Ron Perlman is known in Fallout fandom for delivering the now-iconic voice line, "War. War never changes."

It wasn't until some time later that Perlman became aware of the phenomenon that became Fallout.</p><p>"A year and a half later, I get a call, 'Hey, you remember Fallout?' No. 'Well, there's a second one.' I go, 'Why?' ‘Because the first one went through the f**king roof,'" he remembered thinking. "I go, 'Really? Cool.' Do the second one, then the third, fourth, and now it's a whole brand."</p><p>Also in the interview, Perlman said he's never played the Fallout games or spent any time with the development teams. "No. I did a couple of lines, got my $40 and my sandwich, and went home," he said.</p><p>Crucially, Perlman did not disclose what kind of sandwich he got for his work on Fallout.</p><p>Fallout 2 was developed by Black Isle Studios, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-developing-and-publishing-fallout-3/1100-6102349/" data-ref-id="1100-6102349">Bethesda swooped in and bought the rights to the series in 2007</a> and made Fallout 3, released in 2008, as its first entry in the series.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/14/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-but-theres-a-bonus-bit-of-season-1-to-fill-the-gap/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Season 2 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> has been delayed until February, Battlefield Studios has announced, with an extension to Season 1 coming to fill the extra month wait.</p>
<p>Season 2 will now start on 17th February, with Season 1’s battle pass extended up until that point, and with new weekly challenges and a Frostfire Bonus Path of content being added on 27th January.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 2 Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylKfsTB3uKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The team writes, “During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2.”</p>
<p>So what’s coming to fill out Season 1? Well, an update is set to land on 20th January with fixes and stability improvements, and this will be followed on 27th January by the Frostfire Bonus Path of battle pass. This includes a weapon package, soldier skin XP Boosts and more for those with the premium Battle Pass, while a free track will include Hardware XP Boost, vehicle skin, player card customisation, and the like.</p>

<p>The Bonus Path will work alongside and not instead of the Season 1 Battle Pass, so you still have more time to round off any more unlock tiers you need or want. However, all Bonus Path Points are earned through Weekly Challenges, and not all Weekly Challenges reward those points. Expect people to get annoyed by this.</p>
<p>A little further away, a Valentine’s Day event is coming with duos, there’s more daily login rewards and double XP weekends to flesh everything out.</p>
<p>This has all been rather disappointing for the community on Reddit, with a fairly doom-laden outlook on how much content has been added to the game so far. There’s been comparisons to the map output of Battlefield 4’s paid DLC, memes about map design, critiques of cosmetics and general concern for the future of the game. EA struck a huge and symbolic victory over Call of Duty with Battlefield 6, but they need to keep up the game’s support in order to cement their status as a true rival and counterpart.</p>

			<p>There’s a game for the original DS called Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime. In it, you play as a slime and have to load up your cool tower with all sorts of powerful ammunition to beat other towers. It’s one of those games that stands out in my memory as not only being a lot of fun, but also a concept I don’t feel like has been revisited since. DuneCrawl has a couple of mechanics that feel in the same spirit, and while the whole package is a bit uneven, that did put a smile on my face.</p>
<p><iframe title="DuneCrawl - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Im0Hx3iLVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DuneCrawl is an open-world adventure game where you get to sit on top of a big old crab and fight other big crabs using cannons, yourself, and anything else you find. That’s only part of it though; it’s really more of a game where you explore dungeon-like areas to rescue people, find treasures, and progress the story. I wish the game was more weighted towards the cool crab fights, but alas, here we are.</p>



<p>Combat on the crab is loading up the cannons, firing, and using a shield to bounce things back. You can load yourself or another player in the cannon for cool boarding shenanigans though, and that’s wonderfully silly in a Sea of Thieves kind of way.</p>

<p>Non-crab combat is fairly standard hack and slash stuff. You get a bunch of weapons you can cycle through for different effects, which weirdly includes health potions, and have to try and hit stuff before stuff hits you. It’s fine, really, and some of the weapons are pretty cool, but it’s not a standout example of this genre.</p>
<p>The world is nice though. I enjoyed exploring things both on and off-crab, and there’s a solid sense of humour running through a lot of the quests that’ll help keep you entertained. The idea of this world that has issues with pottery and worships crabs is just kind of fun, and it helps make it feel genuinely unique very early on. I just wish the gameplay felt a little bit more special as well. It all just feels okay for the most part, and I want more than that from my games.</p>

<p>DuneCrawl is at its best with friends, which is really the saving grace here. As is so often the case, running around all of this stuff with a friend or two really elevates everything and ends up being a genuinely entertaining time. After all, where else can you load a friend into a cannon and then fire them off into the distance just for fun? That’s the kind of experience that we’re all after, and sure, it can be used to actually play the game as intended, but it’s nice to mess around with too.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		DuneCrawl is an interesting game that blends together giant crab combat, dungeoneering and multiplayer shenanigans. It's fun enough, but I really wish it did a little bit more with the more unusual aspects of its game design.&nbsp;	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Former <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> CEO <strong>Robert Kotick</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-stepping-down-end-of-year-matt-booty-taking-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role</a> on <strong>January 1, 2024</strong>, following the company's merger with <strong>Microsoft</strong>. During his last few years in the gaming industry, Kotick's figure became quite controversial, especially when a report from the Wall Street Journal alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-aware-harassment-verbal-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the executive had long been aware of the harassment issues within the company</a> and even <strong>faced personal accusations of wrongdoing against employees</strong>. In one incident, he was reportedly verbally abusive towards an assistant, even threatening to have her killed in a voicemail message, though an Activision Blizzard rep claimed the message was just hyperbolic. In another instance, Kotick reportedly threatened and then fired a flight attendant on his private jet after she accused the pilot of sexual harassment.</p>



<p>That's exactly where the lawsuit filed four years ago by the Swedish pension fund <strong>Sjunde AP-Fonden (AP7)</strong> takes off against Kotick, alleging that the executive (and the Activision Blizzard Board with him) <strong>rushed the sale to leave behind the scandals and the subsequent liability</strong>. AP7 additionally claims that the Board breached its duty of loyalty by choosing a quick exit over the company's long-term value, arguing that the sale price of $95 per share was too low because it was negotiated while the stock was artificially depressed by the ongoing scandals. Furthermore, Kotick himself was entitled to a golden parachute worth hundreds of millions of dollars as part of the deal.</p>



<p>The former Activision CEO begs to differ, as you would expect. To begin with, Kotick <strong>emphasized that Microsoft's offer of $95 per share represented a 45% premium over the stock price at the time of the announcement</strong>. In recent filings, the former executive noted that Activision's actual performance after 2022 fell short of nearly all long-term targets, indicating that the sale was a timely and beneficial exit for investors.</p>



<p>But the latest twist came in the most recent filing (available for reading <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/980767428/Sjunde-AP-Fonden-v-Activision-Blizzard-Inc-Et-Al-2022-1001-No-100949828-Del-Ch-Jan-12-2026?language_settings_changed=English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Scribd</a>), in which Kotick accused another game publisher, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong>, of somehow colluding with AP7. Here are a few quotes:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Plaintiff’s Board also has ties to a rival video game company, Embracer Group AB (“Embracer”), a Swedish gaming company that directly competes against Activision. The Vice Chair of Plaintiff’s board, Emma Ihre, served as an Embracer executive at the time that this lawsuit was filed in November 2022. As far as Mr. Kotick is aware, Plaintiff made no effort to address this clear conflict of interest, and neither did Embracer.</em></li>



<li><em>Embracer was facing extreme economic turmoil in Fall 2022, and was grasping at ways to reverse the decrease in its stock price that occurred throughout 2022. The lawsuit did just that: Embracer’s stock price spiked immediately after AP7’s complaint was released to the public on November 9, 2022—by 15% from November 9 to 11, 2022. Indeed, the increase from November 9 to 10 was the largest one-day increase in Embracer’s stock price for the entire 2022 year. This benefitted not only Embracer, but also AP7 and Ms. Ihre (who owned significant shares in Embracer).</em></li>



<li><em>Notably, this lawsuit was timed to occur just days before Embracer would be announcing disappointing financial results and the delay of its most highly anticipated game, Dead Island 2. Embracer announced these results and the delay of Dead Island 2 on November 17, 2022, which Embracer knew would exert downward. </em></li>



<li><em>[...]this Delaware lawsuit was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision, making it more difficult for Activision to recruit talent and expand through M&amp;A activity of the sort that Activision relied on to grow historically. </em></li>



<li><em>Just two days before AP7 initiated this action, on November 1, 2022, Embracer announced that it was kicking off a “new PR and Communications team” based out of Livermore, California.</em></li>



<li><em>The fact that this PR team was kicked off just two days before this suit was filed does not appear to be a coincidence—bad press for Activision would have made it easier for Embracer in its new “PR and Communications” campaign. By contrast, through its false claims in this suit, AP7 painted Activision as a company with poor corporate citizenship.</em></li>



<li><em>This collateral attack on Activision also appears to be tied to Embracer’s desire to boost sales of its games while leaving Activision hamstrung in the development of its own games that competed against Embracer’s titles. Not only were multiple Activision games delayed or cancelled after this lawsuit was brought (including Odyssey, Overwatch 2 Hero Mode, and Call of Duty Warzone Mobile), but Embracer had a number of contemporaneous releases that it knew would compete against Activision’s titles.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>According to Kotick and his lawyers, the contemporaneous releases were <strong>Dead Island 2</strong> and <strong>Call of Duty Zombies</strong>, <strong>Insurgency</strong> and <strong>Call of Duty</strong>, <strong>Remnant 2</strong> and <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, and <strong>Warlander</strong> and <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Embracer has since refuted Kotick's allegations. In a statement <a href="http://substack.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.TAzxpN3N72uz4fiy4KCyTdWBaHxkiRkE6tTsAwmhXlA?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Game File</a>, they said:</p>



<p><em>Embracer did not and does not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision. There was no coordination or collaboration between Embracer and AP7 relating to any of Mr. Kotick's statements. No agenda or instructions were directed from Embracer via Emma Ihre or directly to AP7.</em></p>



<p>We'll keep an eye on the developments of this lawsuit, which is far from over. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re preparing to put some of your holiday cash to work by building yourself a gaming PC, stop. Before you lock yourself into a mediocre graphics card that will mess up your whole rig, check out this Amazon deal on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">the ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 card, which is just $540 for a limited time</a> (down from $609). That goes double if your dream DIY rig is going to be on the smaller side — we’ll explain why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Anyone who’s ever built a gaming rig from scratch or performed a massive overhaul to upgrade an older machine knows — or should know — the two things they absolutely cannot compromise on: the processor and the graphics card. The latter can be a real challenge if you’re looking to build a compact yet seriously potent rig, because graphics cards that are small in size also tend to be small in performance. But the ASUS RTX 5070 is a 2.5-slot model that’s small form factor-friendly, which means it can fit in a smaller chassis while packing enough power to blow away virtually all the other SFF-ready cards.</p>
<h2>Secret Weapon</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 is basically a unicorn: powerful enough for modern gaming, cool and quiet enough for daily use, and trim enough to slide into smaller chassis without fuss. That’s a sweet spot for any DIY gamer, especially when you consider the&nbsp;12 GB of GDDR7 memory, you’re looking at a card that beats up mid/high-tier textures and takes their lunch money.</p>
<p>That extra memory isn’t just a numbers flex that looks good on a spec sheet — it actually matters when modern games start leaning hard into photoreal lighting and other next-gen features that lesser cards won’t be able to keep up with. Coupled with PCIe 5.0 support, you’re set up for a smooth ride across a wide swath of titles and workloads for years to come.</p>



<h2>Keep It Cool</h2>
<p data-start="4446" data-end="4979">A compact rig chassis runs the risk of heat issues — smaller container, less area for heat dissipation. Or smaller components running super-fast — and super-loud — cooling units. The RTX 5070 has ASUS’s Axial-tech cooling design, with a tighter fan hub and longer blades that push air more effectively while keeping noise in check — perfect for a living-room PC that doesn’t sound like a hurricane.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">Thermals and noise aside, performance is where this card quietly flexes. For 1440p and even 4K gaming with some settings toggled just right, the RTX 5070 handles itself admirably. Games look great with DLSS tricks up your sleeve, and the triple display outputs (DP 2.1 + HDMI 2.1b) mean you can drive multiple panels without the headache of wrestling with adapters and dongles.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">With ASUS packing the RTX5070 with advanced features and Amazon knocking the price down for a limited time to just $540, the SFF-ready ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070 is the deal you can’t afford to ignore if you’re planning on building your own rig or upgrading an old one.</p>

<p>The Creator Codes scheme is a way for communities to give back to their favorite streamers while simultaneously supporting a new release. Hytale also has a Creator Codes program, and this guide lists various creators and their codes.</p>



<p>Certain individuals are recognized as a creator for a game. This associates that personality with said title, and fans of the game and creator can support both. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pvp-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> features the Creator Code, and you can scroll down for information on creators, codes, and how to redeem them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Congratulates Hytale Launch Six Months After Canceling It]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-congratulates-hytale-six-months-after-canceling/</link>
            <guid>1405666</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In June 2025, Riot Games canceled Hytale and <strong>closed down </strong>Hypixel Studios, marking the end of the dreams of Minecraft fans worldwide. Hytale, the chief Hypixel project, had been in development for <strong>ten years</strong>, but it was cited as being ‘overly ambitious’ and failed to hit quality expectations, and was wiped from the slate by Riot Games.</p>



<p>Four months later, in November, Simon Collins-Laflamme, the founder of Hypixel, acquired the Hytale IP from Riot Games and brought back to the grind to make the game a reality.</p>



<p>Hytale entered early access <strong>yesterday</strong>, and Riot Games was quick to praise the game’s launch in a move that some have dubbed ‘ironic at best.’</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-skyrockets-despite-earlier-cancelation">Hytale Skyrockets Despite Earlier Cancelation</h2>



<p>Hytale was never supposed to see the light of day after it was <strong>canceled </strong>by Riot Games a little over six months ago. The game was deemed past the point of saving, and Riot shut the project down after suggesting it was unsustainable and too costly to push on with.</p>



<p>Yesterday, that all changed as Hytale hit the early access launch window many believed would never come.</p>



<p>Hytale skyrocketed up the charts, hitting a peak viewer count on Twitch of 440,000 users, numbers comparable to the launch of an AAA game. It’s not without its flaws, but it’s already being appreciated by those who spent years following the game’s development.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Riot Games, which decimated Hytale mere months ago, congratulated the early access launch:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Congrats on early access 👊</span></p></article></div>







<p>In response, the Hytale team commented: ‘Thank you for helping bring Hytale home.’</p>



<p>But fans were quick to criticize the situation:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘This is like thanking your captor for beating you up.’</li>



<li>‘Hytale exists in spite of Riot, not because of them.’</li>



<li>‘Genuinely, how did they help lmao’</li>
</ul>



<p>Perhaps Riot Games is kicking itself for canceling what is now being regarded as one of the biggest indie releases of the last few years.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re playing (and enjoying) Hytale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Shoot A Plane monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and much more.</p>



<p>Shoot A Plane is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes/">Roblox</a> survival experience that assigns players to either hit flying targets or miss their chance at victory. The player must eliminate the planes to win, while the planes must escape your missile launcher to survive. The game also features multiple upgrades for your missile and launcher, however, to use them, you must purchase them with Cash.</p>



<p>The Roblox game is all about growing your missile to increase your Power, improving your targeting accuracy, getting Upgrades, and boosting your score. Generally, to become the best, you’ll not only need the finest missile launcher but also a way to progress without spending hours. That’s when you should redeem the active Shoot A Plane codes, as they can be redeemed for Cash, which is essential for upgrading your equipment and taking down bigger planes.</p>







<h2 id="h-active-shoot-a-plane-codes">Active Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>WEARESORRY: 7k Cash</li>



<li>NEWYEAR: 7k Cash</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-shoot-a-plane-codes">Expired Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-shoot-a-plane-codes">How To Redeem Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot A Plane Codes Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow these steps to redeem all the active codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Shoot A Plane in Roblox</li>



<li>Find the button labelled ‘Codes’ on the far left side of the screen and click on it</li>



<li>Type or paste an active code in the text-box</li>



<li>Click on the button labelled ‘Redeem’ to claim the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-shoot-a-plane-codes">Where To Get More Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<p>Shoot A Plane codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Shoot A Plane Discord server, which has a dedicated channel where new codes are posted first, and the Crazy Launchers Roblox Group where developers announce updates and milestones for this popular missile-launching game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

That came as something of a surprise given the company’s combative relationship with modders in the past.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as part of that relationship, select creators worked with Rockstar to build and supply the new mod superstore as it rolls out "in phases to ensure the best experience for both creators and server owners."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As one happy player <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289/14" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>, the official marketplace makes it "much easier to find some trusted creators and hopefully more competition." "Amazing idea! Hope this will be a better way for both creators and server owners to reach more people and find what they need," <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289/38" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, there are hundreds of mods to choose from, some of which are free, and others, most typically bundles, are available for upwards of $450. The <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7220084-attractions-parks-bundle" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Attractions &amp; Parks Bundle</u></a>, for instance, includes a Theme Park, Water Park, and Maze Bank Theme Bank for $137.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, most mods seem to be for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, but Cfx.re has mods for both Grand Theft Auto 5 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, so we may see more Red Dead 2 mods as the marketplace expands.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto is an enduring juggernaut, with GTA 5 having sold 220 million copies to date. Rockstar is yet to detail how GTA Online will change as a result of November's release of GTA 6, but it seems likely the Cfx Marketplace lays the groundwork for a similar offering in whatever's next for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also seems in preparation for whatever other plans Rockstar has for monetising GTA RP when GTA 6 comes out. GTA fans had begun speculating about what Rockstar RP servers would look like when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-officially-working-with-gta-roleplay-server-team-sparking-fresh-excitement-about-gta-6"><u>the company announced it was working with Cfx.re back in 2023</u></a>. That excitement then only increased when popular musician Faheem Rashad Najm a.k.a. T-Pain teased in 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/t-pain-confirms-hes-working-on-gta-6-gta-5-nopixel"><u>he was working on GTA 6</u></a> but had been asked by Rockstar to stop engaging with RP servers like nopixel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is getting a very short update in the middle of January, but it's one that was needed to nerf the power of two weapons: the Trigger 'Nade and Kettle. Embark Studios acknowledged the issues with both when laying out the details for Arc Raiders' 1.11.0 update.</p><p>According to <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-11-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark</a>, the Kettle's maximum fire rate of 600 was "only realistically reachable by players using macros." In other words, it played right into the hands of cheaters who were using outside software for an unfair advantage in the game. After the update, the Kettle can only reach a maximum fire rate of 450.</p><p>Similarly, Embark noted that the Trigger 'Nade was dominating PvP battles and players used it more than any other grenade in the game. The nerf for this weapon is limiting the radius of damage to the center of the explosion and increasing the time it takes to detonate to 1.5 seconds to give opposing players a chance to react when it's deployed. This was also meant to make it harder for players to use it as a "trigger-in-air" grenade.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635190" data-ratio="0.51384615384615" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635190"></a><figcaption>The Abyss set cosmetics from Arc Raiders.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg"></figure><p>The Abyss cosmetic set is also coming to the game with this update. The description notes that "the scyring techno-eye stapled to the front of its helm might not be operational, but it's certainly intimidating."</p><p>Embark acknowledged previous reports about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">Arc Rangers selling 12 million copies</a> and celebrated by giving all players who joined before January 13 the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-get-this-free-pickaxe-as-game-passes-12-million-copies-sold/1100-6537346/" data-ref-id="1100-6537346">Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool</a>." Additionally, Embark has promised to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-new-anti-cheating-measures-are-coming-soon/1100-6537291/" data-ref-id="1100-6537291">introduce more anti-cheat measures</a> to Arc Raiders in the near future.</p><p>The complete notes for Arc Raiders' January Update 1.11.0 are included below.</p><h2>Arc Raiders January Update 1.11.0 Notes</h2><h3>Kettle</h3><ul><li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using 3rd party software.</li></ul><h3>Trigger 'Nade</h3><ul><li>Dev note: Trigger 'Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favor picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a "trigger-in-air" grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li></ul><h2>Bugs</h2><ul><li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.</li><li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li></ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Despite the supposedly top secret nature of this evidence, People Make Games was able to make an appointment to view the documents, as Rockstar had not applied for reporting restrictions to be placed upon the evidence. He has now reproduced those messages in full, showing an apparent conversation by a fired employee who was frustrated at not being able to book time off after Rockstar started cracking down on the number of employees being granted leave at one time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuipPQDd_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dnuipPQDd_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"They mentioned the large session we did today 'being difficult to do,' but that was 32 players, not sure how that was difficult," the former employee wrote in the Discord, after mentioning they worked in a team of 56 people. "Sounds like 'you have multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organize a 32-player session and let people have their time off' ..." added another employee who was also fired in the wake of the messages.</p><p>Rockstar's argument refers to these messages as "highly confidential and commercially sensitive information relating to the content and features of an unannounced online service," saying that the information constitutes a leak because it "discussed the specific number of online players planned for this new service."</p><p>Presuming the 32-player number is the planned cap for GTA 6's online play, the revelation isn't exactly a bombshell, as the current iteration of GTA Online already allows 32 players to a server. The new information seems to contradict <a href="https://fravilys.medium.com/que-pr%C3%A9pare-rockstar-games-pour-la-prochaine-version-de-gta-online-b1d1c91ec329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors</a> that circulated last year, suggesting that an upgraded edition of GTA Online would allow 64 players at a time, with the intention of eventually supporting 96-player servers.</p><p>Some of the other messages that were submitted by Rockstar as grounds for the firing are also interesting, not because they contain important information on GTA 6, but for what the studio is classifying as "gross misconduct." In some cases, it's employees discussing crunch, concerns about generative AI, or changes to certain perks provided by Rockstar.</p><p>In one case highlighted by People Make Games, it's a single, 15-word message: "Nothing that I've heard in North QA! Will keep you updated if that changes ofc." Rockstar's grounds for dismissing this employee was that he "included information about working patterns in his team," which could be used by those familiar with the industry to guess what stage of development GTA 6 was at.</p><p>The preliminary hearing was only the first stage in the court battle between Rockstar and the union, with the judge asked to rule on whether Rockstar should be made to provide "interim relief" for the fired employees while they await the results of the full trial. The request for interim relief was rejected by the Glasgow Employment Tribunal, but the full trial is still to come.</p>

<p>Originally available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, the compilation has now been rated by the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41099/the-disney-afternoon-collection/">ESRB</a> for the Switch and Switch 2, though when we can expect to see it launch is anybody's guess. The rating itself is attached to Atari which, as you'll no doubt be aware at this point, wholly owns Digital Eclipse as a subsidiary.</p>
<p>The Disney Afternoon Collection contains a total of six titles from the NES (so why it's taken this long to come to Switch is beyond us), including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ducktales">DuckTales</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/chip_n_dale_rescue_rangers">Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/talespin">TaleSpin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/darkwing_duck">Darkwing Duck</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ducktales_2">DuckTales 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/chip_n_dale_rescue_rangers_2">Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/the_disney_afternoon_collection">Push Square</a> gave the compilation a score of 8/10 back in 2017, stating that "the production values and accuracy of these emulations are second-to-none" while noting that rewind features and art galleries make it an essential purchase.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/shokz-openrun-pro-headphones-keep-you-aware-while-you-listen-now-39-off-at-amazon-2000659455</link>
            <guid>1405603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As we find ourselves at the beginning of the new year, it’s a natural time to think about fitness goals—whether that’s running your first 5K, sticking to a consistent workout routine, or training for your first marathon. The challenge, of course, is motivation. While the days stay short and temperatures low, even the best intentions can be hard to follow through with. One of the most effective ways to stay on track is to make your workouts something you genuinely look forward to. For me, that’s turning my runs into dedicated podcast time—and the right gear makes all the difference.</p>
<p>I’ve been working my way through the third campaign of <em>Not Another D&amp;D Podcast</em>, and four days a week I’m out running, listening, and actually excited to lace up. My go-to headphones for this routine are the OpenRun Pro from Shokz. If you’re looking to upgrade your workout setup for 2026, now’s a great time:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/"> they’re currently 39% off on Amazon, dropping from $180 down to just $110</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bone Conduction Listening</h2>
<p>What sets the OpenRun Pro apart is their bone conduction design. Unlike traditional earbuds, these don’t go in your ears. Instead, they sit just in front of them and transmit sound by vibrating through your cheekbones. You still perceive clear audio, but your ears remain completely open. Elder millennials might remember those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">novelty lollipops from the ’90s</a> that played music through your teeth. This is a far more refined version of that idea.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of bone conduction is safety. Because your ears aren’t blocked, you can hear what’s happening around you. When you’re running outdoors, especially near traffic, being aware of approaching cars or cyclists is crucial. The OpenRun Pro lets you stay entertained without tuning out the world fully.</p>



<p>Comfort is another standout feature. The headphones sit around your ears like a backwards pair of sunglasses and use a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame. They stay firmly in place even during high-intensity workouts, which eliminates the constant worry of an earbud slipping out mid-run. Personally, I find them far more reliable than in-ear options.</p>
<p>Battery life is dependable, offering up to 10 hours of listening on a single charge. There’s also a fast-charge feature that gives you about 1.5 hours of playback from just five minutes plugged in—perfect for those times you forget to charge them overnight.</p>
<p>Shokz also offers a mini version for smaller heads. The standard model measures 20.7 cm across, while the mini is about 21 mm shorter at 18.6 cm. Both versions are currently discounted, with color options including black, beige, and blue.</p>
<p>If one of your 2026 goals is to stay consistent, safe, and motivated with your workouts, the Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones are a smart investment to help you get there.</p>

<p>Hytale is now available in PC early access, though this only marks the latest step on a long journey, and there’s plenty of new content and updates to come in the roadmap ahead.</p>



<p>After a rollercoaster development, which included the game being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled by Riot Games</a> last year before being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reacquired by the original creators</a>, Hytale is now in the hands of gamers worldwide, and there’s still plenty more to enjoy.</p>



<p>In this guide, Insider Gaming highlights everything on the agenda to be added to Hytale in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Hypixel Studios has not revealed an official early access roadmap for Hytale, though details have been shared on the plans for future updates and additional content.</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Hytale website from the early access launch on January 14, it was stated that the roadmap “isn’t completely pre-planned” as the team is “expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players,” adding that players can share bug reports and feedback directly in-game.</p>



<p>Further into development, an official Hytale roadmap could be shared by Hypixel Studios, though this isn’t guaranteed. In the meantime, Hypixel Studios promises to deliver updates “quickly and frequently.”</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hytale-planned-content-amp-updates">All Hytale Planned Content &amp; Updates</h2>



<p><strong>Some features and content plans have been shared by Hypixel Studios that will be brought to Hytale in the future, with the initial focus being on bug fixes and areas of improvement.</strong></p>



<p>In the early access release blog post, it was stated that “there is still a large backlog of obvious construction sites” that need to be tackled before the team can move onto “larger, more bespoke updates and patch cadences.”</p>



<p>Additionally, it was said that work on official minigames will “begin in the coming months,” which will enable Hypixel Studios to create new systems and features that expand gameplay and provide wider access to 3rd-party servers.</p>



<p>It’s also added that the team has “prototypes of social features” in development, including friends lists and proximity voice chat.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, patch notes for the <a href="https://hytaleversions.io/versions/1-0-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">v.1.0.0 early access release</a> highlighted some content that is “coming soon,” with the following listed as on the agenda.</p>



<ul>
<li>New biomes, dungeons, and world events rolling out across early access.</li>



<li>Additional bosses, gear tiers, and crafting specializations.</li>



<li>Deeper multiplayer features, social hubs, and better matchmaking.</li>



<li>Expanded modding and creator tools once stability milestones are reached.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hytale developers have released a hotfix to address the most critical launch issues, including connectivity, stability, launcher, and services-related problems. </p>



<p>Hypixel Studios seems to be experiencing a spectacular early access launch for Hytale, with the founder confirming that the game has secured development costs for the next 2 years with prepurchases. However, the game is still in early access and needs some major fixes, and the developers have already released a hotfix to address them. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-hytale-hotfix-update">What’s New in Hytale Hotfix Update?</h2>



<p>Hytale’s current hotfix focuses on resolving the most critical issues reported since the game’s launch. Additional fixes and less urgent concerns will be addressed in future patches. Regarding connectivity, a message will now appear after the server starts if authentication is needed. Additionally, clients will switch to offline mode if their server becomes invalid.</p>



<p>Several stability issues have been addressed, including crashes that occurred when selecting hairstyles, taking screenshots for users with non-English folder names, and while using buckets. The crash related to buckets is affecting some workbenches, which will need to be destroyed and replaced to fix the problem. Additionally, other issues have been resolved, such as the one that prevented Norwegian players from launching the game, the incorrect binding of mouse buttons to certain actions, and general improvements to stability.</p>



<p>The Hytale Hotfix has introduced several important updates to the launcher. Firstly, it now includes a warning that alerts players if their computer’s date and time settings are incorrect. Additionally, the hotfix addresses an authentication issue that some users encountered while logging in. Moreover, an exploit that allowed players to spoof their usernames has been resolved. Finally, improvements have been made to the caching of game patches and the functionality of email sending services.</p>

                <p>The new year has barely begun, but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, and Essential subscribers are getting their first Free Play Days of 2026 this weekend. From January 15-18, players who participate in the event will get to play one of the most popular sports games in the world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, for free.</p><p>To get the word out, EA and Xbox shared a video of retired German soccer player Toni Kroos--who played for Real Madrid for a decade--working the phones and reconnecting with people.</p><p>Game Pass Premium and Essential cost $15 and $10 a month, respectively. However, Microsoft is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/browse/free-play-days?ocid=EAGames_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_buy_1.13.2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently running a special deal</a> that will let players try Premium for 14 days for only $1. Essential is also getting a $1 preview period, but for 30 days instead of 14. Unfortunately, Game Pass Ultimate isn't getting a discount at this time and the price remains $30 per month.</p><p>According to research company Newzoo, EA Sports FC 26 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-pc-and-console-games-of-2025-ranked-by-global-revenue-so-far/2900-7368/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7368">the console game that generated the most revenue in 2025</a> in terms of international sales through the end of November. Among PC games, EA Sports FC 26 placed sixth overall.</p><p>EA Sports FC 26 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-fc-26-review-strong-potential/1900-6418417/" data-ref-id="1900-6418417">reviewed by GameSpot</a> in September 2025, and it received a 7/10 score. Our review noted that it was a marked improvement over its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-ref-id="5000-635887">EA FC 25</a>, while also acknowledging its imperfections: "There are flaws on and off the pitch, yet this is the best the series has been for a short while. It might not walk away with a trophy this year, but it's getting closer to glory."</p>

The rollout has not gone smoothly so far, with some players' ages being wildly miscalculated, others finding workarounds, and some flat out refusing to engage with the verification system due to privacy concerns.</p><p>Roblox's age verification system <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">first started rolling out</a> in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands in early December, and now will be extended to all regions where chat is available. The AI-powered age check, which estimates a user's age by analyzing their face, must be completed to unlock chat features. Users over 13 have the option of verifying their age using ID instead.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> WTF Is Going On With Roblox? | Spot On</p>
      </div>
<p>The estimated ages are used by Roblox to lock off chat with users who are outside of a person's age range--for example, a 13-year-old can chat with users between the ages of nine and 17, while a 16-year-old can chat with users aged 13-20. The new age check is designed to safeguard children from predators, following intense scrutiny on Roblox from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/" data-ref-id="1100-6533929">legislators</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the media</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-roblox-safe-a-parents-guide-to-roblox-safety-policies/1100-6533600/" data-ref-id="1100-6533600">concerned parents</a>. However, users have quickly proven how easily it can be bypassed.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-ai-powered-age-verification-is-a-complete-mess/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a> reports finding Roblox accounts that have been age-verified as young as nine for sale on ebay, while <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/age-check-to-chat-update-fast-follow-roadmap/4238626" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Roblox has acknowledged</a> that some parents are age-checking for their children, resulting in their accounts being sorted into the 21+ age group. Social media is rife with videos of players using different tactics to bypass the age check, including using <a href="https://x.com/shitpost_2077/status/2009622984714055867" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">virtual avatars</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@saige1700/video/7592735752442744071?q=roblox%20age%20&amp;t=1767965074688" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">photographs of celebrities</a>, or even <a href="https://x.com/MugoScales/status/2007825372126261251" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">drawing on facial hair and wrinkles</a>. Last year, when Discord and Reddit implemented age verification in certain regions, users discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-next-level-graphics-are-outsmarting-ai/1100-6533526/" data-ref-id="1100-6533526">Death Stranding 2's Norman Reedus</a> could be used to bypass certain AI-powered facial age checks.</p><p>Alongside those intentionally trying to fool the system, other Roblox users who have tried to engage with the system legitimately have found that the AI age estimation is often inaccurate. <a href="https://x.com/Xxjetkofan2/status/2009300702473130385" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Multiple</a> social media <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1qcafsp/roblox_i_am_19_i_dont_even_look_that_young_this/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posts</a> show users who claim to be over the age of 18 being categorized in the 13-15 year old category, while <a href="https://x.com/mystsful/status/2009009515178660267" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">others</a> <a href="https://x.com/LucasIfy89652/status/2009030352346501541" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claim</a> that siblings as young as 10 have been sorted into older age categories.</p><p>Some users have flat-out refused to engage with the age verification system at all, choosing to leave chat features locked due to privacy concerns with the AI verification software. YouTuber Schlep, known for his content around safety in Roblox, <a href="https://x.com/RealSchlep/status/2009829840841753065" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a warning </a>that the company providing Roblox's age-verification service, Persona, is currently being sued over privacy and data safety concerns.</p><p>Overall, players aren't happy with the new policy, with some choosing to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1q90jmy/saw_some_kids_protesting_yesterday_in_brookhaven/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">protest in game</a>. In its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about the new system, Roblox says that "more than 50% of daily active users" have completed age verification in the regions where it was rolled out in early December--a relatively low percentage considering over 40% of players have instead chosen to go without chat features for over a month. Whether the age check will improve safety concerns on the beleaguered platform remains to be seen.</p>
