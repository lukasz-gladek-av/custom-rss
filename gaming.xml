            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Just in time for the holidays, the Epic Games Store is now allowing gifting on the storefront. The feature has been a highly requested addition from fans and couldn’t come at a better time.</p>







<p>Epic Games Store is a fairly new service, only launching in 2018. As a competitor to Steam, the storefront houses many popular releases like Battlefield 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-maps-quests-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and Epic Games’ own Fortnite. However, one factor that Steam had over Epic Games Store was gifting. On Steam, you can gift a code or a copy of a game to another user. Despite a large game selection, the Epic Games Store had yet to implement the system. Now, the joy of gifting has arrived and right before the Holiday season.</p>



<h2 id="h-gifting-now-available-to-users-on-epic-games-store">Gifting Now Available to Users on Epic Games Store</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gift games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on Epic Games Store!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the Epic Games Store, the company revealed that gifting has been added to the storefront. To do the process, pick a game you want to buy for someone and choose “Buy as a Gift”. From there, choose who you’ll gift the game to from your Epic friends list, and you can pick to schedule it or do it ASAP, then purchase. From there, the recipient has two weeks to accept the game. If not or rejected, you’ll get a refund. </p>



<p>The gifting service extends to paid games (including certain editions), add-ons, and bundles. However, in-game currency, subscriptions, free games, and pre-purchase offers are not allowed. A more step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/features/gifting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>Now, you can surprise your friends with new games without any hassle. While it seems like something that should’ve been there since the start, it couldn’t have come at a better time of the year. Plus, with so many great games in 2025 like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you can gift the best of the best to friends and finally convince them to play it. </p>







<p>Are you happy to see gifting come to the Epic Games Store? Will you be gifting games to your friends? What games? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

"I honestly have no idea," he admitted. "Something about it being a prime number?" He said someone tossed out the number in the early days of developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the team at Capital Games has maintained it as a target lifespan for the Star Wars-themed mobile role-playing game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given that the oldest still-running online games are around 28-29 years old (a casual search says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cms.furcadia.com/">Furcadia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may be the oldest one?) that's an ambitious timeline to set, especially in the world of online mobile games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, meaning it's outlived a number of other EA-published Star Wars free-to-play games and seen the release of five films, seven live-action series, and about six animated shows. The Star Wars name </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/three-reasons-star-wars-outlaws-might-have-undersold">isn't always enough to attract players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So what has Capital Games done to survive for so long?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larsen of course gushed about the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> player community and their loyalty for sticking with the game for so long—but if you want some practical takeaways for your live service team, you'll want to follow him back to 2018, when we were all reeling from backlash to the objectively best (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>editor's note: this is not objective but Bryant insisted we keep this</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">film in the series: Star Wars Episode VII: The Last Jedi...</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/google-to-reduce-play-store-fees-after-settlement-with-epic-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Google to reduce Play Store fees after settlement with Epic Games</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Capital Games used new game modes to make ">Capital Games used new game modes to make <span>Galaxy of Heroes</span> development more sustainable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Last Jedi actually has very little to do with this story—neither does Solo: A Star Wars Story, the other major film release of 2018. According to Larsen, 2018 was instead the year that high-ranking guilds began messaging Capital Games that they were feeling the effects of slowing player growth. "We're not getting enough new players coming in and progressing fast enough to backfill players that are leaving," Larsen recalled them saying.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the same time, Capital Games was feeling the strain of making new content with four-year-old tools. Around this time, the studio determined that the way it worked was "too heavy and manual," requiring developers to hand-author all aspects of new content—content that could be consumed quickly and leave players spinning their </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tsmeu-6_personal_wheel_bike">wheel bikes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This was when the team conceived of the "Conquest" and "Galactic Challenges" game modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As much as they were modes, they were [also] attempts to force ourselves to evolve the way that we operate and create some new procedurally generated content," he said. "I think we were kind of frustrated as a team that in having to go fast and try to get more track in front of the team that we weren't making some of those investments in early years."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-eclipsed-150-million-downloads" target="_self" data-discover="true">Pokemon TCG Pocket has eclipsed 150 million downloads</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Releasing these modes and making a number of other changes opened up space for the Capital Games team to plan further ahead, a challenge that's particularly tricky with a license like Star Wars. Disney's infamous secrecy with upcoming projects means some companies like EA aren't privy to plot points or characters from upcoming projects—making it challenging to plan for content that can be timed to new Star Wars stories. Larsen said he personally learned this in the run-up to the 2016 release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. "I think it sensitized me to that movie development to be a fluid process," he said. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vJZjqmmL-24">Cuts can get made on the editing floor.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">"&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what do you do when you're missing key information most other studios would be able to make themselves? Larsen nodded to the upcoming Ryan Gosling vehicle Star Wars: Starfighter as an example of how the studio is "planning ahead" while working with limited information. "We're thinking how ships are probably going to be really notable in there. What can we pull off? How can we start getting ahead of that?" </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">already has spaceship-friendly systems, but just knowing those basic details can let the studio begin planning technical and high-level design concepts to have content ready when the movie comes out.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/-a-new-way-to-get-discovered-apple-pitches-its-new-game-app-to-developers" target="_self" data-discover="true">'A new way to get discovered:' Apple pitches its new game app to developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the "season" format (one used by many live games now) that lets the developers shape meatier content from the new films months or years after their release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But let's double back to Larsen's comment about speaking with player guilds. They played a key role in helping Capital Games update its development strategy. What can we learn from the kinds of players who stick around for the 10-year run of an online RPG?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some early ">Some early <span>Galaxy of Heroes</span> players are now raising kids of their own</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larsen said he officially realized he was working on a "generational" game when he saw some players describe how they'd started playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in high school and are now introducing it to their own kids. For some back-of-napkin math, if a 17-year-old began playing in 2015 and had a child at age 22, their five-year-old might be old enough to watch the films...or at least ask their parents if they have games on their phone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of these players were early adopters who dipped from the game in the years after launch, only to return later and find a veritable feast of play modes available on their return. Even though the game is called a "role-playing game," Larsen said its most dedicated players find the most fun in on resource management. "It's about expressing [their] intelligence," he said. Marketing director Fabien-Pierre Nicolas-Kim said this has made the game popular in France and Germany, two regions with strong affinity for tabletop and digital strategy games (among other regions of course—he namechecked India, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe as regions with strong playerbases).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means these players aren't so concerned about "role-playing" Star Wars characters per se, they're interested in collecting the various characters, upgrading them, and mixing/matching them to win battles and head up the leaderboards.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">10 years of development has meant there are a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>lot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of characters to choose from (Larsen's personal favorites include Knights of the Old Republic fan favorites Darth Revan and Darth Treya) Larsen said the 37-year battle plan involves making sure these players feel like their investment in the game—be it time or money—is "respected," and that new content can still be challenging without rendering older parts of their collection invalid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair did say they work hard to ensure low-spending (or zero-spending) players are as rewarded for their time in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as possible. Larsen said since his early days on the team, he's watched his coworkers prioritize what he referred to as "the right decisions for players," even if it meant "leaving money on the table" or "not extracting value." He mentioned the team doesn't always "get it right," but did say there's always been a desire to center those investments even when they've missed the mark.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How can mobile RPGs evolve over time?">How can mobile RPGs evolve over time?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is one of many free-to-play mobile RPGs where players collect characters to power them up and upgrade their power levels. It'd be fair to say the format's a little calcified, and unlike their competitors, Capital Games can't easily tap into the "collaboration" market that lets them mix-and-match characters from other franchises. With 27 years left on the clock, where can the series go from here?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larsen played it coy here, but he said the trend he's followed since his earliest days at EA have been the efforts to make it possible for players to play games wherever they want, on whatever platform they want. He recalled an experiment where EA's social team making Facebook games had been "embedded" with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team to try and make a multiplatform experience. The game got canceled, but he said the trends of the years after, where players can play games across mobile, console, and PC platforms, makes him think they were onto something. "It was like Betamax," he said. "We're always looking for what's new—where we go find fandom and bring the ability imagine your own Star Wars experience, wherever it is that you want to be playing." The team is, interestingly enough, apparently experimenting with controller-friendly game modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've got versions of the game that are wrapped to controllers and we've created synchronous PvP modes that we haven't released yet where it actually works quite well," he said. "I don't know that that moment lasts forever, but I think there's something there for us to be exploring currently."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA's made multiple statements about wanting to get out of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-shutters-battlefield-dev-ridgeline-games-torches-respawn-s-unannounced-star-wars-shooter">licensed games business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so it's not impossible that in 27 years, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">will be the last game standing at the now </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/saudi-arabia-is-taking-ea-private-alongside-other-investors">partly-Saudi-owned publisher</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It'd be a testament to Capital Games if they make it through what will surely be another two-plus decades of game development chaos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But you know what they say.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> creative director Guillaume Broche of Sandfall Interactive would very much like to play a remaster of Lost Odyssey, the mournful 2007-released Xbox 360 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and development studio Mistwalker. He feels the game was cruelly dinged by reviewers of the era for adhering to certain conventions. He also reckons it’d have done better if it had released for hardware other than the Xbox 360, which was trying to make in-roads among Japanese consumers at the time.
</p>
<p>
"It became a cult classic because few people played it, as it was available only on Xbox 360 while its core audience was probably more used to PlayStation consoles," Broche told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale</a> in a retrospective interview, published earlier today. "But that core audience who did play it loved it. The critical reception at the time was very unfair in my opinion, as the game was criticised for being 'old school' at a time where it felt like every game that was not an open world was viewed as 'old school' by the western press.
</p>
<p>
"I didn't share that opinion at all and its linear structure, coupled with a world map, an amazing story, and fantastic music, made it one of the best games of its kind,” he added.

<p>
I’m not sure I’d go that far, but sure, Lost Odyssey is very good and deserved more eyeballs than it got. There are a few aspects I dislike, such as achingly long treks between save points, and yes, it has random battles, which used to rustle the jimjams of European and North American critics, but have been out of fashion for so long among big budget RPG developers that they've sort of become an exciting novelty. Ah, remember when you couldn’t reach the end of a mountain path without hallucinating 12 fishbowl punch-ups with one and the same giant beetle/harpy duo.
</p><p>
The combat is quite elegant, mixing questions of duration and positioning with a magic ring QTE system. But I liked the game more for its absorbing visual novel interludes – memories reclaimed by your immortal protagonist Kaim - and its faded industrial fantasy setting, which feels like a post-apocalyptic edition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy X</a>’s Spira.
</p>
<p>
Broche says the game "never had any real successor", which is perhaps overlooking Sandfall’s own Clair Obscur, though I’ll leave it to you to debate the resemblance. "Justice for Lost Odyssey," he told EG. "Remaster it now so more people can play it, please."

              <p><span>Back in June, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-mcdonalds-job-application-boosting-smurfing-dev-riot-games-2000616955"><span>Riot Games</span></a><span> canceled </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Minecraft-</span></i><span>inspired survival game by Hypixel Studios. This was five years after the </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>company acquired the studio in 2015, and the team was shut down as a result. A lot can change in five months, though, ands Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme recently revealed some good news: he’s been able to get the rights to the project back from Riot to continue making the game.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><span>blog post</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>official site, Collins-Laflamme says Hypixel has rehired “more than 30” developers who were part of the original development team, with more expected to follow. The studio is fully independent now, and is “committed to funding </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> for the next 10 years.” But the exact terms of the deal with Riot and the source of funding for </span><i><span>Hypixel 2.0</span></i><span> haven’t been shared beyond Collins-Laflamme and co-founder Philippe Touchette co-funding the project.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> from Riot Games,” the announcement reads. “While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riot </span><a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1990480588797849881"><span>confirmed the news</span></a><span> as well, saying the deal is “giving this community its best shot” with a revised version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>. Collins-Laflamme spoke more candidly about the deal </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1990479580088435017"><span>on his personal X account</span></a><span>, saying that the game may have some “rough edges” right now, but the team wants to get it out to players sooner rather than later. That should come as a relief to fans who have been waiting years for something to actually ship.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This game has always been close to my heart, and I’m excited to bring it back home,” he writes. “Real talk: </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>isn’t some polished AAA release waiting in the wings. It’s messy. It’s janky. And there’s a lot of work to be done. My plan? Get it out to you as soon as possible. No more waiting. You’ll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won’t be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we’ll shape it into something truly special.”</span></p> <p><span>Hypixel says it will be rolling out its full early access plan, along with some transparent behind-the-scenes communication, so people know more about the state of the game following its recent cancellation saga. For now, the team asks that fans “be patient when things break and trust the long-term vision.” Hopefully, it all turns out well for everyone involved, and this can be a win for both game preservation and keeping developers employed. God knows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-revive-fan-servers-mod-sony-playstation-dmca-2000644800"><span>we need more stories</span></a><span> like that these days.</span></p>

                <p>A game industry legend, Rebecca Heineman, has passed away due to cancer on November 17, 2025. She was 62 years old. Friends of Heineman have mourned her across <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media.</a></p><p>Heineman had a prolific career in the game industry that included both game design and high-level competitive play. She won multiple Atari 2600 Space Invaders tournament, including the Atari VCS Space Invaders National Championship held in New York. She became the first national video game tournament champion in the United States.</p><p>"I had two strategies. One was "slow and steady", which won the L.A. tournament, and the other was "kill everything on the screen ASAP," which won me the NYC finals," she said in a 2006 <a href="https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/rebecca_heineman/interview_rebecca_heineman.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. "In the finals, I took an hour and 45 minutes to get the highest score. I lost one or two bases because my strategy was riskier, but faster. It paid off and I won."</p><p>Heineman was a founder or co-founder of video game companies Interplay Productions, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül. She worked on hundreds of games, including classics like Dragon Wars and The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate. She also wrote for Electronic Games and worked with major publishers and studios like EA and Sony. Her work touched several major parts of the gaming world.</p><p>Heineman witnessed several changes throughout her time in the game industry, including major innovations in gaming visuals. She recalled how games had become similar to movies, complete with voice actors and scripts. Her approach to game design remained steady, though.</p><p>"The easiest for me is coming up with how to implement a game," she said in 2006. "I always envision in my head what the game should look like on the screen before a line of code is written. Then I design the code to work with that. It allows me to get the game up and running in a very short period of time."</p><p>For more on Rebecca Heineman’s early gaming accomplishments, she was featured in a segment of the Netflix gaming documentary <em>High Score</em>. A GoFundMe is currently underway to assist with funeral arrangements.</p>

                <p>For the last two decades, Yoko Taro has found success with the Drakengard and Nier franchise(s), but he hasn't had a new game since the Voice of Cards trilogy several years ago. However, the creator of the NieR games insists that he's remained busy in that time, but his games keep getting canceled.</p><p>According to a report on <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">4Gamer</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Yoko addressed the issue while appearing on a panel at the G-CON 2025 video game convention in Korea. He told the audience that his most recent projects fell apart during development.</p><p>"I often get told stuff like, 'Why aren’t you making a new sequel to Nier' or 'Yoko Taro isn't doing anything,' but that's because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development," said Yoko. "I've actually been working on some stuff, it's just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven't been doing anything just because none of the work I've done is being released."</p><p>Yoko didn't explain why his projects were canceled or offer any additional details about what they were. He did note that he'd rather see games get canceled than release something that fails to live up to the standards he set with his previous games.</p><p>In 2023, Yoko facetiously said the next Nier game could come out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-says-new-nier-could-come-tomorrow-or-35-years-from-now/1100-6510815/" data-ref-id="1100-6510815">tomorrow or 35 years from now</a>. Nier Reincarnation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-reincarnation-is-shutting-down-but-more-content-is-coming-first/1100-6520531/" data-ref-id="1100-6520531">was shut down in 2024</a>, but Yoko released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nier-tie-in-books-written-by-yoko-taro-releasing-this-month/1100-6521653/" data-ref-id="1100-6521653">two Nier tie-in books</a> that year. Last year, Hiroyuki Kobayashi implied that he's collaborating with Yoko and composer Keiichi Okabe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-is-working-on-new-game-with-nier-producer-and-composer/1100-6523481/" data-ref-id="1100-6523481">on a new project</a>. Earlier in 2025, Yoko shared his prediction that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">AI will put human game developers out of work</a> in 50 years.</p>

                <p>Developer Embark Studios is currently riding high on the success of Arc Raiders, and the studio has now <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that its last game, 2023's The Finals, is shutting down on one specific platform.</p><p>The Finals will close on PS4 when Season 10 starts on March 18, 2026.

"We're incredibly grateful to everyone who's been part of the PS4 community.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For centuries, vampires have checked a lot of existential (and down bad) boxes as a perfect foil for our darkest cravings and existential dread. From Park Chan-Wook’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762073/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Thirst</u></em></a>, Tomas Alfredson’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Let the Right One In</u></em></a>, Neil Jordan’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1531901/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Byzantium</u></em></a>, and Ryan Coogler’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners/"><em><u>Sinners</u></em></a>, I’ve enjoyed contemporary vampiric teas, imbibing the malignant and intoxicatingly self-destructive codependency monsters that make the horror myth so alluring. Yet, like the monster, I craved more.&nbsp;</p><p>On impulse, I recently followed that gothic rainbow of vampiric yearning back to its origin. Not <em>Dracula</em>. Not <em>Nosferatu</em>. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Carmilla</u></em></a>–more specifically, writer&nbsp; <a href="https://electricliterature.com/carmen-maria-machado-carmilla-lefanu-vampire-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Carmen Maria Machado’s version</u></a> of the 1872 Gothic novella by writer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sheridan-Le-Fanu?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu</u></a>. Having emerged from an afternoon reading the novel from cover to cover, I realized that every iteration inspired by it, like Powerhouse Animation’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/castlevanias-final-season-gets-there-in-the-end-1846825280?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Castlevania </em>Netflix series</u></a>, were just watered-down versions, a realization inspired by Machado’s version rage-baiting me into queer enlightenment.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr">!!!!!!!! <a href="https://t.co/YHgotQvp4K?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/YHgotQvp4K</a></p>— 𝑳𝑰𝑽𝑰𝑵𝑮 𝑫𝑬𝑨𝑫 𝑮𝑰𝑹𝑳 🦇 (@screamnhorror) <a href="https://twitter.com/screamnhorror/status/1989129304094200151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>As <a href="https://pshares.org/blog/reading-carmen-maria-machados-update-on-carmilla/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Amelia Brown wrote in her Ploughshares essay</u></a>, Machado’s version of <em>Carmilla </em>is unquestionably “both playfully reclaiming a story that was never stolen while also reclaiming a history that definitely was; the literary history of queer desire.” In the introduction to <em>Carmilla</em>, Machado mentions a real-life event first noted by scholar Professor Leight, who posited that Laura and Carmilla were based on an affair between two women, Marcia Marén and Veronika, one which <a href="https://electricliterature.com/carmen-maria-machado-carmilla-lefanu-vampire-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Electric Literature</u></a> curiously notes no version of <em>Carmilla </em>had ever mentioned before Machado’s. The implication is that Le Fanu took the queerness (and low-key plagiarism) of a correspondence between one Dr. Hesselius and his patient, Veronika Hausle, and turned it into the foundational vampiric novella. In doing so, he excised parts that would’ve made the whole “Is <em>Carmilla</em> queer text” of it all crushingly obvious.&nbsp;</p><p>But Machado’s introduction is also a lie. She made up Leight, Marcia, and Veronika; Dr. Hesselius is cited in Le Fanu’s prologue, and is presumably a fiction, but without any of the queer context Machado adds. Or better put, Machado’s introduction is a flex of “manuscript fiction” as folks on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xjxxft/im_having_trouble_verifying_carmen_maria_machados/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>r/books subreddit</u></a> I quickly flocked to put it. Machado, for my estimation, was using the same benefit of the doubt introduction Le Fanu used in his equally dubious 19th-century prologue, to (perhaps too cutely) reclaim <em>Carmilla </em>as an inalienable queer tale with vague gestures at made-up figures to give credence to that fact.&nbsp;</p><p>Put simply, I was reading a version of the book at war with itself, and one where I arrived at my own truth about the intent, and lack thereof, of its original author and the state of queer texts being a collective hallucination of starved readers or some slight of hand by the author to obscure its original meaning. It’s the embodiment of “I love spreading misinformation on the internet” housed in the perceived sanctity and empirical truth of a book. Still, like a vampire’s familiar putting up with hickies on their neck, I gave in to the lucid, Mandela effect reading experience that Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>was inviting me into and found the pieces I walked away with to be beautiful enough to be my own truth about the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix/Powerhouse Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Carmilla </em>is delightfully riotous. A slow-burning mystery, it follows Laura, a rich girl who, after insisting that her wealthy father let a mysterious girl named Carmilla stay at their secluded mansion, experiences a strange sickness as she, her father, and housemaids piece together that her unbearably pretty roommate has been treating her like a Capri-Sun pack for weeks. Machado’s edits exist as footnotes gingerly spread throughout the book, and despite the deception of the introduction, don’t rearrange words for modern audiences.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite (and very loud) “excisings” among Le Fanu’s omissions of Veronika’s correspondence to her doctor that Machado places in her introduction is a letter where Veronika writes, in no uncertain terms, that the Victorian gals consummated their affair: “I descended the valley of her, over and over, until neither of us could locate our breath.” Contrast that with Le Fanu’s portrayal of Laura and Carmilla’s relationship, where Laura registers Carmilla’s toxic affections as merely sinister—never as the site of a conflicted, inchoate sexual awakening. Machado treats this tension not as subtext but as text, both inventing and excavating the erotic charge buried beneath Le Fanu’s pearl-clutching editorializations of Veronika’s letters to Le Fanu’s doctor. Letters, mind you, that Le Fanu dared to preface in his 1871 prologue by noting that the author of these letters (in this edit, Veronika) was already dead—and thus, in his words, “she probably could have added little to the narrative which she communicates, with such fastidious detail, in the following pages”—before proceeding, in Machado’s casting, to redact her correspondence with a smug confidence that omits all the most revealing parts.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s fabricated reasoning not to include excised text from Veronika’s letters into <em>Carmilla </em>as told from Laura’s perspective (which, again, don’t exist), while admittedly “petty,” felt to me like reading one of those “this you” quote retweets while also dunking on the original poster:&nbsp;</p><p>“I wished this edition to bear LeFanu’s shame. I wish the reader to come to the book with a complete understanding of its inadequacy…I hope you will enter into <em>Carmilla</em> thusly, using your fingertips and mouth and mind to locate the lacunae where Le Fanu excised pieces of Veronika’s account, the hallways haunted by the specters of truth and phantoms of passion. See if you cannot perceive what exists below: the erotic relationship between two high-strung and lonely young women. The shared metropolis of their dreaming. An aborted picnic in the ruins.”</p><p>But, like a vampire's familiar, I decided to give in to the fantasy of <em>Carmilla</em> secretly being a glinted queer text that I was getting in on the ground floor of. And boy howdy was I picking up what Machado was putting down.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>seeps with imaginary contempt and is cattily packaged. The footnotes explain the story like a friend candidly recounting drama from the night before. They provide shorthand annotations explaining what fancy words mean to the everyman while also removing the veil of elegance by spelling out things for what they are. Machado vividly enunciates the danger and desire coursing through Laura and Carmilla's roaring romance by reframing its gothic gestures as intimate, juvenile dramas. Carmilla's nightly visits become the secretive scurrying of a girl hiding under her friend's bed. Meanwhile, a passing mention of Cleopatra's tapestry transforms into a sly metaphor for erotic vulnerability. A breast bared not for pocket watch-flexing bling but for creatures to be drawn to the pulse beneath its bosom.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix/Powerhouse Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a kept promise of Machado’s shrewd, lean addition to Le Fanu's <em>Carmilla </em>enduring as a shame in delighting in the Gothic yearning and sapphic doom of its text, Machado’s notes cut through the flowery language about rapid breathing and “a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation, supervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion” to write frankly, “If this isn't an orgasm, nothing is.” All of this, naturally, takes place on the sixty-ninth page of the 139-page novel. Sensational.</p><p>By the end of Machado’s <em>Carmilla</em>, I witnessed my perception of <em>Carmilla</em> transform from an empty vessel of plot proportion and danger to a Promethean flame that sets Laura ablaze, her blood running with the most tremendous excitement of her boring, rich girl life. I also was left gazing, hands folded behind my back, wondering if Veronika/Laura—the spitting image of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Sorrows?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows</u></a> by the climax of the novel—ever writhed in agony knowing her lovely creature would never cup her face in her hand, plant butterfly kisses on her cheeks and eyelids, or say her name again. Carmilla, Laura’s ferociously alive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Wabi-sabi</u></a>, overnight transitioned into a story she must tell to someone, anyone, to keep alive. In Machado’s telling, her real-life counterpart sought to sort it out by seeking counsel from Dr. Hesselius, before having her tale told by Le Fanu for profit and paraded in homages that didn’t know the original source to whom they were riffing.&nbsp;</p><p>The main trait of any vampiric tale is that of doomed yearning and excess. To that end, Machado invites readers to savor the curated meal she has prepared, even if it means transforming Le Fanu into a blithering idiot of a sous chef, where his every perceived sapphic omission acts as the excess fat that makes the marrow of Machado’s dish all the more savory. Whenever queerness rises to the surface of Le Fanu’s text, Machado nudges it into the open while practically looming over your shoulder to nod at your inquisitive glance at that line you just read being gay AF.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>lets readers who want <em>Carmilla</em> to be a queer text to say that it is: a black rainbow of a formative horror novella. A four-car pile-up where megalomania, hubris, yearning, and infatuation crash. A book that's one-size-fits-all and sapphic as hell for all the languishers of the world to let out a heavy sigh of relief, feeling seen by a take on the vampiric tale that nudges queer subtext into the sunlight for all to see. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Waiting for a reincarnation</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoko Taro, the creator of the Nier and Drakenguard games, has been awfully quiet lately. Though he's worked on some smaller projects (writing scenarios for Voice of Cards, and a few mobile games), the lack of a proper Nier follow-up or other new major game from him has been getting under fans' skin. But according to Taro, he <em>has</em> been working on projects. They just keep getting canceled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from his remarks at Korean gaming convention G-Con 2025, which were <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on by 4gamer</a> and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translated by Automaton</a>. The panel, which featured Taro and Bayonetta and Okami director Hideki Kamiya, saw the pair asked for updates on recent projects. Kamiya mentioned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-okami-2-from-our-exclusive-interview-with-its-creators">the upcoming sequel to Okami</a>, while Taro said he'd been very busy with new projects, they just keep getting canceled partway through.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to NieR’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t  doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Taro isn't discouraged by this, apparently. He continued, saying he'd rather fail repeatedly and eventually create something good, rather than put out multiple mediocre works. “I believe that if I’m going to release something weird, I’d be better off not releasing anything at all.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/18/gettyimages-477373540-1-1763485628367.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoko Taro introduces Nier during the Square Enix press conference at E3 2015.

Especially since Nier: Reincarnation, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">was effectively a sequel to Nier: Automata</a>, is still completely unplayable by virtue of being a mobile gacha game that's since been taken offline with seemingly no plans to rerelease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So good luck to Taro, hopefully we see a new project from him that makes it to release sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the summer of 2012, ROUTINE was revealed at the largest video gaming convention in the world Gamescom, but after well over a decade later it has yet to make it into the hands of players. In the coming weeks, that’s all about to change, and as I sat down with two of the game’s three developers, Aaron Foster, head of art and design and project lead, and fellow artist and designer Jemma Hughes, it was all smiles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll have gone gold in just a few days,” Aaron told me with a grin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Theirs is a classic indie developer story, a handful of developers setting out to work on a project they were passionate about, learning every difficult lesson along the way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Routine started as a very simplified, atmospheric, slight-horror game. I started it on my own, and was actually inspired originally by the simplicity of Dear Esther,” Aaron said. “I wasn’t a programmer at the time. I was an environment artist, actually, and wanted to use my experience to make a game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I grew up in the 80s watching VHS's and it left a big impression on me.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I grew up in the 80s watching VHS's and it left a big impression on me. Now that I’m an environment artist, I’ve never stopped loving that aesthetic. I love the weathering and the hum of fluorescents and little details like that. When making Routine, I thought, ‘if I made this game in the 80s, what would I imagine it like?’ and so, sorta took that and ran with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Jemma and our programmer, Pete, came on that really opened a lot of doors for us. We started showing a few screenshots and eventually got help on audio, so that’s when we were ready to show the trailer.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aaron and Jemma’s environmental art chops were more than enough to catch the attention of masses, and when they released their reveal trailer in 2012, their self-published little endeavor left an impression on people. But then work on the project suddenly halted, and wouldn’t pick back up again until 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There was quite a long delay that was due to personal reasons, actually. We were dealing with almost going personally bankrupt and had to pause and work on other projects to make ends meet,” Aaron said, with the difficulty from those years apparent in his voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually their situation improved, though, and there was still a lot of passion among their small, but mighty team to pick the project back up. However, doing so after a years-long hiatus proved no easy task. The first obstacle was that the development landscape had completely changed, including, most consequentially for their team, the tools used to make them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we picked up development again, we actually had to start from scratch, because we’d worked on the game for 4 or 5 years in Unreal 3 Engine, then came back in 2020 on Unreal 5 using a completely different code – C++ instead of Unreal Scripts.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so the team took the opportunity to make ground up changes to Routine that spanned gameplay, art, and more. Having learned a lot from their time developing on Unreal 3, the team decided to refocus gameplay around a less combat focused design, give the story a complete overhaul, and change the way AI worked, expanding on ideas in some places and trimming back in others to bring the project more in line with the team’s renewed vision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we weren’t paused, we were mostly gutting stuff that didn’t work. The C.A.T. was originally primarily a weapon. That was removed and turned into what felt more like an actual tool. You saw a lot of that in the demo you played. It even has an off button!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Routine - 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The C.A.T., also known as the Cosmonaut Assistance Tool is the primary way the player interacts with the world around them. A boxy, retro-looking multitool, you pick this handy item up early on and it evolves over time as you find new modules for it. It was one of the big focuses during the rework after they started working on the game again, and Aaron’s eyes light up when he talks about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t want to make a bunch of modules, so instead we decided to make each module multipurpose. For instance, the ultraview module is a blacklight, but also a flashlight, so while the other one helps you defend yourself, it doesn’t have a flashlight, so there’s more than one reason to have one module equipped at any time,” he told me.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The C.A.T. does cool things like lets you connect to terminals, so it’s kind of like your cell phone, a camcorder, a flashlight – a multitool.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“It also does cool things like lets you connect to terminals, so it’s kind of like your cell phone, a camcorder, a flashlight – a multitool,” Jemma added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are more modules than what you’ve seen though. There’s one more later in the game. It may or may not help you defend yourself,” Aaron said with a laugh.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There were more changes beyond the C.A.T too, including a refocusing on the setting, which takes place on the moon. The moon is something of a fascination for Aaron, and something he wanted front and center. Before the pause in development, they’d increasingly built indoor environments where players couldn’t be blamed for forgetting they were on the moon at all – a state the team found unacceptable. Having played the demo recently, the moon is almost omnipresent, especially early on when they take every opportunity to shove the moon’s desolate vistas in your face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Narrative was also a huge change. The stuff we had before took away from the setting of the moon, we thought, and so we wanted to refocus on that,” Aaron explained. “I’ve always just been drawn to the moon. I think it looks just beautifully barren, and mysterious, and a bit creepy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of creepy, as you explore the space station, you’re never far away from the game’s primary threat – the Type 5 robots that attack you on sight and which cannot be dealt with using force. These heavy, metal Terminator-looking monsters are a sight to behold, and make the most alarming noises when they’re around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The AI got a rework too. Actually, you may not have noticed this, but the Type 5 robots are only ever active one at a time. That got changed at one point for reasons related to the narrative.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I’ll admit, I didn’t notice this, and actually spent minutes on end hiding from robots I had no idea were deactivated and unable to see me. Aaron and Jemma found this pretty amusing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, usually there’s this moment in some of the playtests where they’ll notice the robot just standing there and sort of peek out and then go ‘oh, he’s turned off’ and then you can walk right in front of them and see they don’t notice you at all,” Aaron said. “Just don’t be there when they come back on!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked about the design behind these terrifying monstrosities, Aaron explained there's a completely rational explanation for why someone built them to look like the stuff of nightmares, and also for how these could exist in the same universe as the tiny, boxy helper robots you’ll find scurrying about on the same space station.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Type 5s are actually repurposed riot control robots from Earth, so that’s why they look intimidating and a bit scary as you saw. The purpose of the IC robots is to be helpful, so they look cute.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked how Routine stands out in 2025, where we’ve enjoyed an absolute tidal wave of awesome games to play, Aaron spoke to the philosophy of letting players learn for themselves – a practice that’s less common in the age of in-game characters explaining puzzle solutions to you a few seconds after you encounter them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s just a very different kind of experience. We don’t hold your hand and make the player figure stuff out and there’s just not a lot of stuff like that out there at the moment.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who spent about 20 minutes beating my head on a single puzzle during the demo, I can attest that this is certainly true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before wrapping my call with the team, I paused to ask them what advice they would give to indie developers setting out to make their first game as they started to do all those years ago. Aaron’s answer came after only a second or two of thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the most important things is just work on something you care about, regardless of scale. If you care about it, you’ll be able to see it through. We knew we wanted to finish this game and we did. It took a while, but we all cared about it, and here we are.”</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-is-an-indie-horror-game-over-a-decade-in-the-making-developer-interview-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Even more tweaks for an already massive update.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> team snuck in a few extra changes alongside the California Resistance Season 1 update today, revealing changes for Escalation, challenges, and player profile kill/death statistics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last-minute additions to today’s 1.1.2.0 update arrived in the form of <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1990799899080688037?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a surprise social media post</u></a> this morning, just a few hours after the gargantuan patch targeted some of the fan feedback EA and Battlefield Studios have received in recent weeks. California Resistance most notably adds new map Eastwood into the mix, but these new bonus adjustments aren’t exactly anything to scoff at, and they’re already live.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list is a change players have been looking to see for one specific Battlefield 6 game mode: Escalation. BF Studios confirmed the tweaks, which increase objective capture time by about 20%, are a direct result of fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This change gives your squad more time to react, reposition, and coordinate vehicle spawns while maintaining the mode's fast-paced intensity,” the message says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lower on the totem pole of fixes is yet another fine-tuning for challenges. Where past updates have added clarity to and reduced requirements, this smaller, backend change implements a fix for completed challenges that failed to give players their rewards. Finally, BF Studios says player profiles will no longer reflect Portal kill and death statistics in the full kill/death count. Instead, only human kills will be recognized here, with an area for Portal kills set to arrive in a future update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are small but necessary changes for many, with Battlefield 6 players still enjoying all of the more substantial tweaks delivered with update 1.1.2.0 and California Resistance earlier today. In addition to Eastwood, new guns, and new features, the update reverts aim assist settings back to those seen during the August open beta while also continuing to tackle weapon bloom and dispersion.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guild Wars Reforged - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, ArenaNet is doing something similar once again. Reforged will include the original game's Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns (but doesn't seem to include the Eye of the North expansion) for one price. It will additionally come with some new bells and whistles to improve the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is controller support, which should make the game Steam Deck verified (though that official designation is still pending, according to the Guild Wars Reforged website). It will also bring some graphical improvements like better rendering, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom effects, new HD skill icons, and larger text options. High-DPI support is also being added for high-resolution monitors.</p><p dir="ltr">On the audio front, Guild Wars Reforged has been "rebuilt" with 3D environmental audio. In terms of actual gameplay, the only real change is a new quest-tracking and direction system that will better guide players to where they need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, it's far from a full-fledged remaster, but does look to update Guild Wars for the modern age and make the actual act of purchasing Guild Wars simpler for prospective players. All the improvements found in Reforged will be a free update to those who already own previous versions of Guild Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">While Guild Wars continues to celebrate its legacy, its sequel continues to forge ahead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-sixth-expansion-arrives-in-october-with-a-new-beachside-housing-option/1100-6533145/" data-ref-id="1100-6533145">Guild Wars 2 saw the release of its sixth expansion</a> in October--one that added new elite specializations to the game's professions, new housing options, and more.</p>

<p>Check out the first trailer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Netflix's animated series, <strong>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</strong>, is returning to the streaming service next month, with season two kicking off on <strong>11th December</strong>. And look, we even have a trailer!</p>
<p>This second and final season, which once again stars Hayley Atwell in the titular role, sees Lara and co. race across the globe to get their hands on some ancient masks that pack some mysterious powers. There's an uber-rich "techno-visionary" trying to hunt the relics down too, so no prizes for guessing who the goodies and baddies are in this situation.</p>
<p>The all-new trailer (above) gives a taste of the animated action we can expect to find in December, with super-powered headwear, globe-trotting escapades and a fight with a shark — yes, really.</p>
<p>The first series was met with mixed reviews on release last year, but with a live-action adaptation in the works at Amazon and the 2013 game making a surprise appearance on Switch and Switch 2 today, perhaps there will be more interest this time? Somehow, we doubt it, but hey, it's a good time to be a Tomb Raider fan!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA have announced that there will not be an F1 game launching next year and instead, F1 25 will be getting paid DLC.&nbsp; “The decision to offer a premium content update for F1 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise,” they explain.</p>
<p>The 2026 DLC will “bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers,”&nbsp; but no other details have been revealed. The next game in 2027 is going to refresh the franchise so it “looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.”</p>


<p>“F1 25 has been an incredible success, fueled by the passion of fans and the energy of the sport. With Formula 1’s momentum on and off the track, now is the perfect time for us to look ahead and build for the future<em>. </em>We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world,” adds Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed F1 25’s entry in the yearly sporting franchise, which brought its own fictional F1 story to the table with the third Braking Point tale. Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">our review</a>, “F1 25 is a clear improvement over last year’s entry, with improved handling, the returning Braking Point story mode and more all coming together to create an excellent F1 racing experience.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-25">F1 25</a> was enhanced with a DLC pack that was inspired by F1 The Movie, the&nbsp;content comes in the form of six Chapter Scenarios, which are available either as part of the Iconic Edition or to be purchased separately. These events take you to key moments from the movie, tackling dramatic weather, strategic moments and overcoming the odds at Silverstone, Monza, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Spa-Francorchamps, and Abu Dhabi. Completing these scenarios unlocks Sonny Hayes’ helmet for use in F1 World and Driver Career.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Giants Software has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone since the game launched just over a year ago.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has hit four million sales across all platforms, which puts it ahead of fairly major hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide" rel="nofollow">Konami's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake</a>&nbsp;(although it's still trailing major breakout hit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>).</p>

<p>Giants isn't slowing down with content for&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, either; a second season pass has been released today, and it promises lots of new content throughout the rest of the year, including a brand new JCB tractor that's ready to claim right now if you own the pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/giants-software-farming-simulator-25-sales-4m.jpg?itok=tISs1FLc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/giants-software-farming-simulator-25-sales-4m.jpg?itok=R8qqkj9F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Giants Software. Never change.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned vehicle,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>'s Year 2 Season Pass will also bring a major DLC pack somewhere between January and March, followed by another between April and June.</p>

<p>They'll be chased up by a major expansion that will launch between October and December this year, which will introduce a brand new map and more to the farming simulator. It sounds like there will be plenty of players waiting to greet that pack as well.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, it's...well...it's a farming simulator, and it's this year's iteration of Giants Software's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-22-sales-surpass-3-million-units-globally" rel="nofollow">successful</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-15-coming-consoles" rel="nofollow">long-running</a> series.</p>

<p>Released back in November last year, the game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-2-million-one-week" rel="nofollow">rack up two million sales for itself</a> within its first week of launch, which means it's picked up another two million in the intervening year. That's not bad at all, especially for what remains an essentially niche title.</p>




<p>If you're interested in checking out&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, you can pick it up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300320/Farming_Simulator_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/farming-simulator-25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/farming-simulator-25/9NMCDQ6RCJKH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebecca Heineman, one of the co-founders of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>publisher Interplay, has passed away aged just 62.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interplay-co-founder-rebecca-heineman-dies-from-cancer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Heineman's death was confirmed by close friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Heidi McDonald</a> and former colleague <a href="https://x.com/BrianFargo/status/1990561629080277499" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brian Fargo</a> on social media yesterday. McDonald described her as a "trailblazing game industry bad-ass", while Fargo called Heineman "one of the most brilliant programmers around".</p>

<p>Previously, Heineman had set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoFundMe page</a> to help pay for treatment for her recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma, but yesterday, she said further treatments would be "pointless" according to her doctors, urging donors to give so that her funeral can help her "make a worthy entrance for reuniting" with spouse Jennell Jaquays.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-interplay-rebecca-heineman-death.jpg?itok=lEs59mkZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-interplay-rebecca-heineman-death.jpg?itok=E6cCc5e6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rebecca Heineman co-founded&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>publisher Interplay.</figcaption></figure><p>Heineman was one of the first major video game championship winners, having bagged a prize for her performance during a&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders&nbsp;</em>tournament all the way back in 1980.</p>

<p>Following her victory during that tournament, she co-founded Interplay Productions, the studio that went on to publish iconic and influential games like survival horror classic&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark</em>, CRPGs&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>and <em>Fallout</em>, and the European version of the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em>.</p>

<p>As well as being a major industry figure, Heineman was also active as an LGBTQ+ campaigner. She won a Gayming Icon award from <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gayming Magazine</a> this year, with the publication commending her "advocacy for LGBTQ+ inclusion, accessibility, and diversity in tech".</p>

<p>In her later years, Heineman was also active on streaming and video platforms, showing off some of the curios she had gathered over her decades working in the gaming industry. It's no stretch to say that without Heineman, many of the most well-respected games of today simply wouldn't exist.</p>

Maybe go play a classic Interplay title as a tribute to her and all of the work she's done in the industry over the years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hytale co-founder and original developer Simon Collins-Laflamme has purchased the rights for the game back from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">original owner Riot Games</a>, following the shutdown of the project earlier this year.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> entitled “Hytale Is Saved!”, Collins-Laflamme says the project has been acquired from Riot Games in its entirety, and the new team is “fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next ten years”, a commitment he says he’s making alongside fellow director Philippe Touchette.</p>

<p>As well as reviving the project, Collins-Laflamme and Touchette have hired “over 30 former developers” who were working on Hytale prior to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">its closure in June</a>, and the two say they will “continue to hire as the budget allows” and as the right candidates for the game are found.</p>

<p>You should, according to the developers, expect Hytale to be in a pretty rough state when it launches, with “bugs, rough edges, unbalanced content, and frequent updates that break things” being par for the course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is partly due to the abandonment of the so-called “Cross-Platform Engine”, which would have ensured Hytale’s compatibility with other platforms; instead of using that engine, the developers have returned to Hytale’s original “Legacy Engine”, which they say is “playable now” and which will allow them to “build a game rather than an engine”.</p>

<p>Despite being a big part of the original Hytale release, official minigames won’t be a part of this revived version of Hytale at Early Access launch, but a dedicated team will work on bringing them into the fold “once the core game is stable”.</p>




<p>In the coming days, you can expect to see new gameplay footage and screenshots for Hytale, as well as detailed patch notes for what the team has been working on recently.</p>

<p>In addition, you’ll get a roadmap post showing what’s coming to Hytale in the future, as well as the aforementioned pricing details, an Early Access release date, and “plenty of updates and communication”.</p>

<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with Hytale, it’s an ambitious RPG sandbox that pledges to offer “a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures” that you can “shape…block by block”. Whether that original vision changes with new ownership and a new direction remains to be seen.</p>

<p>If you’d like to keep up with Hytale’s progress, you can do so via the <a href="https://discord.gg/hytale" rel="nofollow">new Discord server</a>, and you can keep an eye on the <a href="https://hytale.com/" rel="nofollow">official website</a> as well.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a> developers Inkle once pitched a Doctor Who game to the BBC, narrative director and writer Jon Ingold has revealed in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jon.inkle.co/post/3m5sx6jiqps2i">a Bluesky post</a>. While the BBC never responded to their overtures, the pitch became the basis for Inkle's very excellent and bodacious astral archaeology sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">Heaven’s Vault</a>. I consider this a cool thing to know, and so do our friends at Eurogamer. They’ve just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-inkles-heavens-vault-started-life-as-a-doctor-who-game-before-it-was-exterminated">published an interview</a> with Ingold, which includes tantalising details of a forthcoming Heaven’s Vault reveal of some kind.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Inkle met with a number of potential collaborators in 2014, following the release of 80 Days. According to Ingold: “one of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on. As a lifetime Doctor Who fan, that was the one we jumped on." The team spent eight months working on a pitch for something Who-flavoured and working-titled The Daedalus Effect. It would have been set on an asteroid orbiting a black hole, and would have featured time dilation. 
</p>
<p>
"For the art style, we wanted 2D characters within a 3D scene for a comic-book look, so we built a TARDIS interior model, drew some character art, and built a prototype where you could move around the console room," Ingold told Eurogamer’s Victoria Phillips Kennedy. "We also built a playable 'fly through the vortex' game for the travel sequences, inspired by Super Hexagon. And the most significant thing we did was start rebuilding the ink engine, from the very scrappy first version that powered 80 Days and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorcery">Sorcery!</a> series, to the more modern version that we eventually open-sourced."

<p>
Alas, the Who game was not to be: a decade later, Inkle are still waiting for a response to the Doctor Who pitch. This is possibly for the best, however. Heaven’s Vault is terrific, and Inkle are arguably in a stronger place for having embarked on their own original setting. "It opened Inkle up a lot - until then we'd be doing adaptations and IP-based work," Ingold noted. "Heaven's Vault was the first thing we did that was all ours - and people embraced it - and that experience is what made A Highland Song, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overboard">Overboard</a>, and all the rest possible."
</p><p>
Ingold isn’t sure they’d make a Who game today, fond as he is of that narrative jukebox, the Tardis. “I still love the character and the wild variety the concept would bring. But there's been a lot of Who games since 2014, and I feel like it'd be hard to capture the same excitement as we felt for the project when we first pitched it." 
</p>
<p>
Besides which, Ingold have their hands full with both a new videogame of some kind and a mysterious “thing”, possibly not a videogame, for the world of Heaven’s Vault, which has now expanded into the realm of novels and, potentially, stageplay. “We've written a pilot episode and outline for an audio drama version (though we haven't sold it to anyone), and we've got one other big thing cooking for the world which we haven't announced yet, but is hopefully going to be truly wonderful for new players and for fans of the original,” Ingold concluded.</p>
<p>You can read more on Eurogamer. Side note: I used to be an embarrassingly dedicated fan of Barbara Hambly’s Darwath books, and they have a wizard character called Ingold I would roughly classify as Sports Illustrated Gandalf. Science has yet to prove that he and Jon Ingold are not the same person.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-the-kotaku-review.1357111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It was around the time that I was fighting a giant plant monster in a chemically induced hallucination themed around hate and guilt that I realized this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a strange one. But moments of strangeness, even a few memorable or inspired ones, can’t hide the fact that this latest installment is the digital equivalent of throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span>’s co-op campaign is a direct sequel to </span><i><span>Black Ops 2</span></i><span>, featuring many characters from and references to this fan-favorite entry. Yet in the end, all those nods to </span><i><span>BLOPS2</span></i><span> just serve as a reminder of how much better that campaign was than this collection of random ideas that you can play either solo or with up to three other buddies.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>And then…and then…and then….</b></h2> <p><span>If I were to describe the plot of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>to you out loud, I would sound like a 6-year-old kid who was asked to come up with a big action-packed story on the fly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>“Okay, so some soldiers go to a secret island to fight a bad lady and her evil company, but it’s a trap, and they are drugged with a gas like from the Batman movies that makes you see scary stuff from your memories and past. Oh, and they are all connected via brain chips, so they all see the same things. And then they fight bad soldiers. Oh, and robots! And also zombies. And then a giant plant monster. And then a giant person. And they go to Tokyo. And then fight some spiders. And then they uh, oh, start a prison riot with undead inmates and uh go underwater to fight giant mechs using big missiles before winning and saving the day. The end!”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <p><span>It’s borderline nonsensical and only barely works as a story at all because of some great voice performances and some incredibly expensive-looking cutscenes. It’s a shame that the entire four- to five-hour campaign feels cobbled together in a short amount of time, but considering Treyarch, which co-developed this game, was also the lead developer on last year’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i><span>, it’s not surprising, either.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>At least the guns still feel good, and I wasn’t bored because when you’re dealing with this level of batshit nonsense, it’s at least interesting to see what ludicrous scenario the game is gonna throw you into next. Shooting, sliding, jumping, and now wall-jumping (more on that later) are fun regardless of what I’m killing. Less fun and more annoying is that RPG elements have woven their way into the campaign, so you reach points where enemies take a lot of bullets to kill, and you have to wait for the game to decide to end your pain and give you a damage upgrade. Bleh. No good. Don’t like. Never bring this back, thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Speaking of annoying things I never want to see return, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-slop-regulation-2000644735"><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span> introduces an always-online open world to explore between bigger missions. Even though I played solo, sometimes other players would speak during cutscenes when I was teleported back to this part of the campaign, which acts like an always-online pseudo-hub between some missions. And there’s little to do in these moments. It’s weird, adds nothing, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358">likely the reason I can’t pause </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"> while playing the campaign</a>, which is yet one more strange choice to add to the pile of odd decisions that make up this year’s</span><i><span> Call of Duty.</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Okay, whatever, what about multiplayer!?&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not stupid. I know that </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a multiplayer franchise. Most people are buying these games not for the single-player adventure, but for the months of deathmatch they’ll get to play with friends and randoms. And thankfully, this part of</span><i><span> Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is a lot better than the campaign. But if you played last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800"><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i></a><span>, you’ll likely feel a big sense of deja vu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> multiplayer feels very, very similar to that of the last entry, down to menus, perks, and gunplay. Now, that’s not inherently horrible, and considering how successful </span><i><span>BLOPS 6</span></i><span> was, it makes sense to build upon that for the follow-up.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, I found a lot of the weapons in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> to feel very same-y and not distinct at all. I bounced around a few guns in the dozen hours I spent with multiplayer and never found one I particularly liked or hated. They all just mostly blended together, with the only distinction being “Oh, this one is burst fire” or “This is a sniper.” I remember the guns in </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> being far more distinct and interesting, and swapping between them was a lot more exciting as a result, as were the firefights against other players.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maps aren’t a strong element of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, either. Some are genuinely very good, but those are mostly the maps ripped from past </span><i><span>Black Ops </span></i><span>games, like Hijacked (which also appears as a level in the game’s campaign). The new maps felt too big for the number of players found in most game modes, and none of them have stuck in my brain. Maybe in a few weeks, some of these new maps will join my list of best </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> maps ever made. But at the moment… ehhh.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“War never changes…wait a minute, is that a giant plant monster?”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Treyarch / various other Activision Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Near-future military online FPS with zombie survival mode  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Fantastic cutscenes, snappy and responsive gunplay, and wall-hopping.  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bad campaign, bland guns and maps, and performance problems.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5 (played), PS4, PC  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the campaign in about five hours, played 13 hours of multiplayer, and a few hours of zombies.  </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>Perhaps the biggest change found in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer is the ability to wall hop. This builds on the fantastic omnimovement that debuted in </span><i><span>Black Ops 6, </span></i><span>which let players sprint in any direction and made </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> faster than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Wall hops add a new tool to the movement kit, and I love it. Being able to bounce up a wall into a window or over a garage is so much fun. It can also be used to escape an enemy, ambush a group of unsuspecting players, or reach an out-of-the-way spot to do some camping. Shut up, it’s a legitimate strategy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While my old-man thumbs and fingers sometimes fail to keep up with the youth and their fancy slides, I still mostly had a good time with </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer, even despite the maps being meh and no one gun calling to me. Wall bounces add just enough extra flavor to fights to shake things up, while not getting in the way of the hyper-responsive FPS action </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> has long been known for.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I do, however, want to flag that on PS5 Pro, I ran into a ton of random performance issues during multiplayer. This really soured my experience. Even a bad </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> typically runs well, so I was surprised to see so many dropped frames and slowdowns happen in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>. Hopefully, a future patch can improve the situation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Zombies and the <em>Battlefield</em>-sized elephant in the room</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not a </span><i><span>CoD </span></i><span>Zombies expert, so I can’t speak to specifics about the mode in this year’s entry, but I can say that I enjoyed my time with it. In a lot of ways, Zombies in </span><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> feels like a return to the versions found in older </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> games, and I like that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You can play a classic rounds-based version of Zombies set in one map. I also appreciate that for the first time ever, when playing solo, you can leave a Zombies match and come back later and pick up where you left off. Fucking </span><i><span>wild </span></i><span>that Zombies has a pause option, basically, while the campaign doesn’t. Strange!</span></p>

 <p><span>I would try to explain the story of Zombies, but it is so obtuse and deep at this point, involving multiple dimensions and a dozen characters spread over multiple games and timelines, that I’m just not going to attempt it. There’s a new cowboy-like demon zombie who is really bad, and I think I’m supposed to kill him by completing the main quest found in the primary Zombies mode. To explain more would require a trip to the </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> Zombies wiki, and I’m not interested in falling down that wormhole.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000645203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645203">©Activision</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a vacuum, this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a weird, really big, and mostly bad misfire that I doubt hurts the franchise all that much in the long run. But if we look beyond </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>and consider the larger context, this might be the worst version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"> for Activision to have launched in 2025,</a> as it’s going up against the super popular, grounded, and back-to-basics </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I bounced between both games over the weekend, and I think that once again, moment-to-moment, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> looks sharper and plays better than </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span>. This has long been the case with these two FPS rivals. But when it comes to content and delivering what fans want, I think</span><i><span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6</a> </span></i><span>wins hands down.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Make no mistake, both games have flaws. But</span><i><span> BF6</span></i><span>’s problems can be solved with some patches and a few big maps. </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> can’t be fixed because it isn’t broken, it’s just a weird and incoherent mess that feels more like a fan mod or big update for </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> than a proper sequel. And it certainly doesn’t seem like the game </span><i><span>Call of Duty </span></i><span>needed in 2025, but rather just the one we got because Activision can’t let the franchise take a break. Ah well, there’s always next year…&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch%E2%80%99s-best-scene-is-as-funny-as-it-is-violent.1357108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> eight-episode run is over, and I stand firm in my belief that the best moment in AdHoc’s superhero workplace comedy comes in episode five, “Team Building.” As the title suggests, protagonist Robert Robertson III takes his staff of reformed villains out for a night at a bar. The problem is, they’re headed to a villain bar. Robert certainly doesn’t look the part, and the bar’s goon and lackey patrons are ready to start a fight when they see him there. What happens next is probably </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s best use of the old Telltale house style, and it’s got players popping off and covering their eyes in equal measure.</span></p>  <p><span>The fight begins with Robert getting a blow to the back of the head, then waking up with his team outside a fast-food joint. At first, you think Robert was knocked out cold and his team got him out of there, so now they’re all just crashing at the local, legally distinct Taco Bell. But then, the group starts to hand Robert his food, and suddenly, you have a QTE to stick your straw in your soda. All right, seems an odd moment to introduce a QTE given that the game uses those pretty sparingly, but—holy shit, I just stabbed a man in the face with a handful of darts!</span></p>

  <p><span>No, Mecha Man did not simply go down without a fight, and the Z-Team wasn’t about to let their boss get made a fool of at their favorite watering hole. So now we swap back and forth between the quiet calm of Z-Team’s late-night snack run and the comically violent excess of their earlier bar brawl. Folks, it’s absolute cinema. The whole fight is set to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6v3vKeg1Ws"><span>Thot Squad’s “Hoes Depressed,”</span></a><span> a catchy-as-hell cheerleader-style hip-hop bop performed by Prism, the Z-Team’s light-manipulating influencer. As the bass bumps through the bar, Robert and co. are making the Red Ring thugs regret even glancing in their direction.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are so many standout gags, I don’t even know where to begin. Prism using her light powers to swat away a man who dared to interrupt her performance, causing him to cover his face and scream that she “temporarily” blinded him, only for her to retort, “Fuck you mean, ‘temporarily’? Bitch, you blind foreva!” is a standout. I also love when the devilish Malevola opens a portal outside the bar, allowing Golem, the team’s giant mud monster who had been exiled outside the establishment, to come in like a bull in a china shop. Punch Up using his short stature to run around below most people’s line of sight and give everyone a fist to the nads is also pretty fun. Those individual character moments are great, but the most effective parts of the whole sequence are the QTE-driven transitions between chilling at the not-Taco Bell and Robert doing some of the most violent non-lethal things he can do to a low-level grunt.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Every time </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> went back to the restaurant and the Z-Team started giving each other shit about the way the night went, it went on just long enough to lull me into a sense of familiar ease, having forgotten the carnage I had just watched unfold. Then, someone would hand Robert something inconspicuous, like a hot sauce packet, I’d tear the packet open—and immediately be thrown into a scene of Robert yanking the cybernetic implants out of someone’s skull. By the time I was actually biting into the food I’d ordered, I knew not to let my guard down and braced myself for the game to leap back and show me what Robert bit into back at the bar. In addition to being very exciting to play, those moments have been some of the most entertaining to watch people react to, because even after </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has established this trick, it still manages to catch players off guard.</span></p>           <p><span>The whole ordeal does end up accomplishing what Robert set out to do, at least. The team becomes a lot closer, and, depending on your choices, will trust their boss more than ever. Sometimes, all you need to bridge the gap between heroes and villains is a good bar brawl.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fleshy, floaty, fabulous. That’s</span><i><span> Morsels</span></i><span> in a nutshell. A top-down action roguelike in which you collect creatures and swap between their unique powers, it shares familiar DNA with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-is-gonna-take-over-my-life-again-1619872452"><i><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nuclear-throne-challenge-completed-beat-the-game-with-1573122068"><i><span>Nuclear Throne</span></i><span>,</span></a><span> but with a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-style twist that has you collecting little creatures and harnessing their powers to overcome an on-screen frenzy of gnarly hazards. I love it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks great. It sounds great. I’m having a great time with </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span>, even if most of the game still feels like a hard-to-intuit fever dream right now. You technically play as a mouse who is gifted these shape-shifting abilities to take on the appearance and upgrades of various titular morsels as you climb the levels of a colorful sewer to thwart the domination of the cats above. Some shoot lasers. Some fart gas. Others augment your dash. Each comes with its own bubblegum-wrapper flavor text.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve only played three hours of </span><i><span>Morsels </span></i><span>so far. That is not nearly enough to work my brain around all of its unusual logic and hidden secrets, which like any great roguelike are embedded within the monotonous but rewarding fabric of trial and error. But it is enough to know that </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span> is not just a fun gimmick wrapped up in a slick aesthetic. I can’t definitively say it has the roguelike juice just yet. However, it is already one of the most intriguing games I’ve played this year.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000645176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645176">Furcula / Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Made by Furcula and published by Annapurna Interactive, </span><i><span>Morsels </span></i><span>counts among its development team programmer Iggy Zuk (</span><i><span>Bad Ice Cream</span></i><span>), artist Toby Dixon (</span><i><span>Atomicrops</span></i><span>), and composer Sam Webster (</span><i><span>Grindstone</span></i><span>). The world looks like it was made out of the intestines of cows who grazed on confetti and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD3jJ0LGPEQ"><span>sounds like</span></a><span> lo-fi acid jazz beats to fester to. With a bubbly bullet-hell action loop pulsing at its core, the overall effect produced is that of a trippy tea party hosted inside a garden full of composting garbage. I mean that in the most delightful way possible.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other thing to know about <em>Morsels</em> is just how much it revels in visual chaos. It’s not as simple as kill/avoid everything else that moves. In fact, playthroughs across meandering levels that often loop back around on themselves are full of strange creatures, neutral NPCs, and side objectives which don’t immediately explain themselves. On paper, <em>Morsels </em>sounds like pretty familiar genre fare, but the actual experience of playing it had me constantly asking “what the hell is going on?” while looking at my screen</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That frenetic sense of uncertainty and mystery, along with the beautiful art and an incredible soundtrack (maybe my favorite of the year) is making <em>Morsels</em> feel like a nice jolt of anxious energy after dozens of hours pulling</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155"><span>slot machine levers in RNG-heavy roguelikes</span></a><span> that reward you for playing them with making you play them less. Will it have the long-term depth of a </span><i><span>Spelunky</span></i><span>? We’ll see. For now, it has my attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-not-releasing-f1-26-new-game-coming-2027/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports has announcemed that it’s not going to release F1 26 next year. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was revealed</a> that instead of releasing F1 2026 in 2026, EA Sports will release a paid expansion for F1 25. This expansion will represent <strong>“the 2026 FIA Formula One World Championship, including new cars, teams, and regulations.”</strong></p>







<p>The next game, then, is scheduled to release in 2027. EA says that the next game in franchise will be a “<strong>reimagined and more expansive EA Sports F1 game”</strong>. They said that the game will deliver a <strong>“deeply authentic and innovative Formula 1 experience.”</strong></p>



<p>Questions around the future of the F1 franchise at EA have been popping up ever since the launch of F1 25. That release was scheduled to be the last of the current contract, though there was an option to extend it for two years. </p>



<p>EA had initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ea-sports-f1-series-continues-with-two-year-option-pick-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to Insider Gaming</a> that the option was picked up to keep the franchise going. However, just hours later, the company retracted that confirmation saying, <strong>“Apologies for the inconvenience, but we’ve been informed that the information we provided earlier today is inaccurate and we don’t have any information at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>Since then, it had been silent from EA and Formula 1 on the state of the series and F1 26. Until now, that is.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and Formula 1 for added context on the decision to not release a game next year. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>







<p>What do you think of EA Sports releasing a paid update for F1 25 instead of F1 26 and waiting until 2027 to release the next game?
