		<p>THQ Nordic has announced a Sacred 2 Remaster, a modernised version of the 2008 action RPG, coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sacred 2 Remaster | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YzPPceRfyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remaster is in development by Jumpgate and SparklingBit, revitalising the game with high resolution textures and improved lighting effects, improved combat, a modernised UI, and bugfixes for the game. This will also include all of the expansions and updates previously released for the game, and I think you can see from the trailer that this will still look and feels like a game from 2008.</p>
<p>A prequel to the original Sacred, this game takes players to the world of Ancaria as it’s on the precipice of disaster. T-Energy, the power source that helped to bring prosperity to the world, has been twisted and corrupted to bring conflict and chaos. Six heroes step forward, each with their own path and story to explore in this world.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatekeeper-is-a-new-first-person-action-rpg-inspired-by-dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic.1260213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025, the publisher announced a new dark fantasy game called Fatekeeper. This project is in development at a small studio in the German Alps, which is home to around ten former Spellforce III developers from Grimlore Games.</p>



<p>The idea behind the project came from a discussion about Hellraid, Techland's game, which seemed like it would finally follow in the footsteps of Arkane's classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. The developers felt (rightfully so, I might add) that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was the first game to make first-person melee action combat feel really cool.</p>



<p>They were also disheartened when Hellraid turned out into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-hellraid-review-hellish-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small DLC pack for Dying Light</a> instead of the full-fledged standalone game that had originally been promised. Following that news, they decided to take matters into their own hands and create their own take on this oft-neglected genre. Thus, Fatekeeper was born, a title with modern graphics (it is powered by Unreal Engine 5), classic RPG elements, and first-person melee action combat.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fatekeeper Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbCAMqhNfzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Every item in the game can be inspected in the menu, and a lot of the items have hidden mechanics that are unlocked only after inspecting them properly. Following the inspiration of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Fatekeeper also allows for deep interactions with the environment, especially when using telekinesis on various objects and characters.</p>



<p>The developers are still working on the progression systems, such as the skill trees, so they haven't been shown yet. However, they promised progression would have considerable depth, like any other system in the game.</p>



<p>Fatekeeeper will be semi-linear. It's not an open world title, but the maps have been designed so that players can devise a lot of paths. While not as hard as a Souls game, this title should also provide plenty of challenge to players who seek that in games.</p>



<p>Frankly, it's about time that someone had such an idea and implemented it. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is long overdue for a spiritual successor, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic have confirmed a new release window for the Gothic 1 Remake, which was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166">previously</a> set to arrive before the end of 2025, will now launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in early 2026. The delay is confirmed alongside the debut of a new gameplay trailer, and the release of a demo for the game finally coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>There's been a demo available for PC players to try out for months now, while console players have been left out of the loop. Now, PS5 and Xbox Series owners can try out the remake for themselves, ahead of its launch sometime in early next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gothic 1 Remake | Xardas Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZ7Tk1XoAdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019, with a surprise teaser demo to gauge players' interest. However, it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020</a> that players knew the remake would be happening for sure. </p>



<p>By the time it arrives in early 2026, it'll be nearly seven years from its announcement to its release, and it'll be nearly 20 years since the last time a new Gothic game was released. There's no indication yet that Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic are looking to make a brand new Gothic adventure, but if the coming remake is wildly successful, the chances of a new game in the series would greatly increase. </p>



<p>We'll find out sometime early next year if this remake has been worth the wait, and if there's any chance at more Gothic games in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside the new gameplay shown in today's showcase and the news of the demo hitting consoles, THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive also announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-classic-1-3-are-coming-to-playstation-and-xbox-in-2026/">original three Gothic games will be making their console debuts</a>, arriving on PlayStation and Xbox sometime in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grimlore-games-has-shadow-dropped-titan-quest-ii-now-available-in-early-access-on-pc.1260201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Grimlore Games confirmed that players anxious to jump into Titan Quest II would be able to do so with the game's early access launch set for sometime during the summer of 2025. Today, during its publisher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPVmpg6koqc">THQ Nordic's Digital Showcase</a> for 2025, the studio shadow-dropped Titan Quest II, and you can rush over to Steam or the Epic Games Store to play it right now.</p>



<p>The new trailer that debuted during today's showcase features plenty of the action-packed scenarios players will encounter in their mythological journey through Ancient Greece, and a few of the quieter moments, as it shows off the work that Grimlore Games has put into improving graphical fidelity and combat.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Titan Quest II was initially set to arrive sometime during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025</a>, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/">announced in May</a> that it would be delayed until sometime in the summer. Which makes today's news hit even harder as a pleasant surprise for players who were hoping to have already put in dozens of hours to Titan Quest II.</p>



<p>Especially the players who got to participate in playtests for the game earlier this year. Even though the decision to delay the game came from these same playtests, Grimlore Games said that "<em>over 92%"</em> of the players who participated in the demo playtest it hosted came away with a 'positive' or 'very positive' rating of the game.</p>



<p>Of course, it wouldn't have been delayed if not for the myriad of issues players called out, like combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balancing, so everyone jumping into the early access launch today will be sure to pay attention to how those aspects of the game have changed in the last few months. And then everything will surely be tweaked further, as it begins its early access journey and the back-and-forth between the studio and community feedback that'll shape the game's development.</p>



<p>When the 1.0 version of Titan Quest II launches, it'll be available for $49.99 / €49.99. The early access version, however, is available on all platforms for $29.99 / €29.99, and if you grab it anytime within its opening week, you'll get it for 20% less, at $23.99 / €23.99.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/weappy-studio-debuts-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-gameplay-no-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/weappy-studio-debuts-new-impressive-looking-gameplay-for-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-still-no-release-date.1260198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Eternal Life of Goldman is a new 2D action-platformer from Weappy Studio, and is easily one of the most impressive-looking 2D platformers on the market, thanks to everything being animated by hand. We just got another look at some more gameplay during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Digital Showcase</a> today, with the game looking arguably even better than it has before, with some new shots in a new trailer. The only downside, though, is that there's still no release date in sight.</p>



<p>While we didn't get any release date news, we did get a bit more of an insight into the story of the game, with the gameplay being shown while a mom and her son discuss Goldman, with the mom becoming more agitated as she divulges how Goldman spent his life pouring over maps, looking for some kind of ultimate treasure that consumed his every waking moment.</p>



<p>By the end of the trailer, she's yelling at her son as she's clearly angry for having followed Goldman in the first place, with the last few lines eerily delivered by the young boy, who doesn't completely understand why or how he's upset his mother, but is now clearly scared of her to some degree, as we're left watching Goldman descend into a dark chasm, and we're left wondering what happened to the boy.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Eternal Life of Goldman | Can Fairy Tales Hurt? | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHLIz4YxCJg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The manual animation style of The Eternal Life of Goldman calls back to games like Cuphead, which was also entirely animated by hand, and is regarded as one of the best 2D games in the past decade.</p>



<p>To be fair, Goldman still needs to stick the landing with its gameplay, Cuphead didn't win all its accolades based on looks alone. But if these trailers can be believed, 2D platforming fans will be in for a treat when The Eternal Life of Goldman launches. </p>



<p>Now if only we knew when it was launching.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/717660/how-to-watch-evo-2025-las-vegas</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-biggest-fighting-game-tournament-is-a-little-smaller-this-year-%E2%80%94-but-still-exciting.1260195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Evo 2025, the biggest fighting game tournament in North America, starts this weekend. If you tune into one of the nine different Evo Twitch channels you’ll see some of the top players in the world compete in fighting game staples like <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em>, and newer games like <em>King of Fighters: City of the Wolves</em>, and<em> Rivals of Aether II</em>. The fighting starts today and lasts till late Sunday, August 3rd. Though this year is smaller, with fewer entrants than last year, there’s still plenty of reasons to watch.</p><p>While Evo remains one of the most highly attended fighting game tournaments in the world, this year, the number of entrants are slipping. Last year there were over 10,000 attendees — <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240724192201/https://evo.gg/news/evo-2024-record">setting a record for the highest number of unique competitors</a> in a fighting game tournament ever. This year, that number is significantly lower with the number of entrants <a href="https://evo.gg/news/evo-2025-competitors-by-the-numbers">slipping to over 8,500</a>.</p><p>There could be a number of explanations for this. Economic volatility driven by inflation and policy has made the cost of living rise precipitously. When people have to think twice between groceries and a trip to Vegas (where Evo is annually held), the trip to Vegas typically loses out. Evo has also expanded, adding tournaments <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/17/12210570/evo-japan-announced/">first in Japan</a>, then <a href="https://evo.gg/events/2025-france">France</a>, and now <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-host-evo-2026-the-world-cup-of-fighting-games">Singapore</a>, giving international players more of a choice of which events to attend.</p><p>Safety is potentially another reason why players are staying away. Evo is an internationally known and recognized tournament, players from all over the world compete in this event. But in the US, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/social-justice/immigrant-families-split-ice-deportations-REEFYKMZ6ZB43GYXWQN3WL4TXY/">conducting raids across the country</a>, ostensibly to arrest immigrants for deportation. But there have been numerous reports that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/634094/trump-dhs-arresting-palestine-student-activists-ice">legal residents,</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-detained-us-citizen-l-charged-obstructing-arrest-rcna215481">US citizens</a>, and even <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america">tourists with valid visas</a> are being arrested and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/nx-s1-5441691/mahmoud-khalil-interview">detained for months</a> or even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/us/timeline-deportation-maryland-father-el-salvador-hnk">illegally deported</a>. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, the Las Vegas Convention Center director of communications Erica Johnson wrote, “The LVCVA’s policy is to abide by all federal, state, and local laws and cooperate with the lawful execution of those.” Evo did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Some notable international players, though, have decided to brave crossing the US border. Arslan “Arslan Ash” Siddique from Pakistan is registered to attend Evo, returning again to compete for another <em>Tekken </em>Championship. Matías “Scorpionprocs” Martínez and Nicolás “Nicolas” Martínez, Chilean twins known for dominating <em>Mortal Komba</em>t tournaments, will also be competing.</p><p>The games themselves might also be contributing to reduced turnout. <em>Tekken 8</em> has the second highest number of entrants after <em>Street Fighter VI</em>, but the game’s second season <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/fans-are-unhappy-with-tekken-8-season-2-heres-whats-causing-the-backlash/">was so poorly received</a> by players that Tekken executive producer Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1911974797225173345">wrote</a>, “I personally do not think this backlash is at all unjustified.” That frustration with the game might have led to its player count being cut nearly in half going from 4,646 players in 2024 to just 2,521 this year.</p><p>Whatever the reason, this year’s Evo will be a slightly smaller, but no less exciting affair that’s worth watching. Take a look at the schedule <a href="https://evo.gg/events/usa2025">here</a>.</p><p>Even though <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fatal-fury-salvatore-ganacci-pushback-reveal">received criticism for some of its character choices</a>, I’m generally excited to watch any game I haven’t seen before. Evo 2025 is also adding two new streams to the schedule for people to watch any of the smaller games that are always featured at Evo but not large or notable enough to get main event stage billing. Also my absolute favorite competitor Dominique “Trans Rights” / “SonicFox” McLean will be there and I’ll watch them whenever he’s on.</p><p>Here’s some other things to look out for:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Mortal Kombat Top 8</em> at 1PM ET on Saturday August 2nd: <em>MK 1</em> has the least amount of entrants that I have ever seen and I want as many people to watch as possible so the competitors don’t feel so lonely.</span></li><li><span><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> top 8 on Sunday August 3rd at 3PM: I really want to see someone using Cristano Ronaldo lose badly.</span></li><li><span><em>Street Fighter 6</em> Top 8 on Sunday August 3rd at 11 PM ET: <em>Street Fighter 6</em> is the most popular game at Evo, boasting the highest number of entrants the last three years, and its finals are always events you wanna watch.</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/717660/how-to-watch-evo-2025-las-vegas]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/717611/nintendo-switch-price-increase-risk-safety</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-nintendo-didn%E2%80%99t-raise-the-price-of-the-switch-2-yet.1260192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Just about every piece of hardware that Nintendo sells is getting a little more expensive in the US — with the exception of the Switch 2. That includes all models of the original Switch, a bunch of accessories, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">even a motion-activated alarm clock</a>. The changes were made ahead of sweeping Trump administration tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect in August, and they show Nintendo is leaning on a strategy that it has employed across its business: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">largely avoiding risk</a>. Raising the price of a new console isn’t the best look, and so the company is trying to claw back some of that money in safer ways, without gambling on the success of its most important product.</p><p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">Nintendo announced</a> that these new prices would go into effect starting on August 3rd. The actual increase hasn’t been announced yet, but a since-removed listing from Target suggests that the console hikes could range from $30 for the base Switch model to $50 for the OLED version. The move follows similar increases in Canada, and Nintendo says they’re being implemented “based on market conditions,” which is corporate speak for tariffs. Notably absent from the list of impacted products is the Switch 2. Nintendo says that current-gen hardware, along with games and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions, “will remain unchanged at this time.”</p><p>So what’s the point of raising the price on old consoles and alarm clocks? Nintendo is infamous for being a fiscally conservative company, and it understands that, like everyone else, it will be impacted by the coming wave of tariffs. But Nintendo also knows that raising the price of the Switch 2 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/646776/switch-2-price-editorial-dollar-yen-exchange-rate-inflation">which was already controversially expensive</a> — less than two months after launch would not go down well. The early days of a console’s life are very important to help establish a baseline audience that a company can then build off of. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">And the Switch 2 is off to a great start</a>. Just this morning <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">the company announced</a> that it had sold nearly 6 million Switch 2 units since its launch in June.</p><p>It seems the company has decided that it’s worth eating whatever added costs come its way if it means a successful launch for the Switch 2 — that includes the impending 20 percent tariff on imports from Vietnam, where many of the consoles are produced. But the same can’t be said for the original Switch or products like Alarmo. At this point in time, sales of the first Switch aren’t as integral to Nintendo’s success, and so the company is comfortable raising its price in response to its own rising costs. The original Switch is less important now but it’s not insignificant; Nintendo noted in its most recent earnings that “demand for Nintendo Switch has remained after Nintendo Switch 2 launched in June.” And so it appears that Nintendo is trying to nickel and dime its way into making up some of what it will lose through the tariffs it’s forced to deal with, all without disrupting the Switch 2’s momentum.</p><p>This sort of risk-avoidance has become how Nintendo operates of late. While it often takes risks creatively, the company is much more shrewd from a business perspective. In its current incarnation Nintendo is an entertainment powerhouse that has expanded into film and theme parks, all while launching a successful new console. But in each instance the company has taken a relatively safe path forward, whether it’s partnering with an established animation studio like Illumination or a global theme park firm like Universal. The Switch 2 itself is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">an attempt to continue the original Switch’s success without changing things up all that much</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">Even the Nintendo Museum tries to present a safe, squeaky clean image of the company</a>.</p><p>The new price hikes are simply a way of applying that way of thinking to the current chaos of Trump’s tariffs. That said, they could also end up being a soft launch of sorts, a way for Nintendo to gauge reactions before it does anything more drastic. Right now it has decided that it’s worth eating those costs, but that might not always be true moving forward. As it noted in today’s announcement, “price adjustments may be necessary in the future.” We don’t know yet what that might look like, but we do know that Nintendo will do whatever it can to avoid disrupting the Switch 2’s chances at success.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/717611/nintendo-switch-price-increase-risk-safety]]></content:encoded>

It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.</p><p>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.</p><p><strong>Hand Crafted to the Smallest Detail</strong></p><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre’s roots and took the most difficult path possible—meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques. We didn’t cut any corners, and the results are worth it. In <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em>, no two rooms or landscapes are alike. Every place, every object, every character, every visual effect—everything is carefully planned and executed to the finest detail.</p><p>Remember how, when you were a child, you first saw your first 16-bit platformer and couldn’t believe your eyes? We want you to experience those feelings again—or maybe for the first time.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_981582"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Tapping the Best of the Genre</strong></p><p>Far from mindlessly relying on cliché and formula, <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> turns the genre on its head. The game carefully includes everything we all love most about side-scrollers, across the various styles, trends and eras. And it leaves out all the frustrating stuff that doesn’t make sense and wastes time.</p><p>It’s a challenging platformer that demands precision, but it never devolves into a grueling exercise where you have to memorize and methodically execute an exact sequence of <a title="Genres > Action [2,903 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.</p><p>It’s a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery—but it won’t have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It’s impossible to spend much time wandering around in <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> without doing anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, it’s a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story—but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension. All the elements work to create an adventure that takes your breath away and breaks your heart.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,012 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,612 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,424 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Microsoft has been bringing more of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games to PlayStation 5</a>, but one major title still missing from the list is Bethesda's Starfield. For PS5 players that were hoping to play Starfield on the console this year, that won't be happening just yet.</p><p>However, that may change next spring, a new rumor suggests. According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/starfield-ps5-release-planned-for-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, sources familiar with the situation indicate that Starfield won't be released on PS5 in 2025. One of the reasons is the lower-than-expected performance of its first expansion, Shattered Space. Microsoft is now looking at a Spring 2026 release for the PS5 version, possibly alongside the game's second expansion and a set of quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>Although it hasn't been officially announced for PS5 yet, Microsoft's recent push toward releasing more games on multiple platforms suggests it's only a matter of time. The company has made it clear that it's open to expanding its reach, so Starfield coming to PS5 seems inevitable--even if the exact timing is still uncertain.</p><p>The next Xbox game heading to PS5 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-big-xbox-published-games-are-getting-ps5-exclusive-physical-editions/1100-6532423/" data-ref-id="1100-6532423">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, set for release on August 26. Other titles likely to follow--still unconfirmed--include Gears of War: E‑Day and State of Decay 3, based on similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-collection-set-for-ps5-this-year-e-day-releasing-in-2026-report/1100-6529840/" data-ref-id="1100-6529840">reports</a>. While Starfield’s first expansion <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received mixed reviews</a>, the base game still earned mostly favorable grades. GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">praised its scale and side quests</a> but criticized its shallow RPG systems and overall polish.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CI Games, the studio behind the Lords of the Fallen games, has permanently lowered the price of the 2023 Lords of the Fallen title, which was previously available for $69.99 USD on consoles and $59.99 USD on PC. Now, the price is $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 for the standard edition on all platforms, with the deluxe edition lowered to $39.99 USD / €39.99 / £34.99.</p>



<p>This also isn't just a cut to the 2023 Lords of the Fallen. The entire CI Games catalogue of titles is getting a permanent price cut, with all of the studio's previous games now listed at $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 or lower.</p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1951319064116179355">X</a>, the chief executive officer of CI Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-developer-ci-games-boss-claims-he-has-data-that-proves-modern-audience-is-a-false-myth/">Marek Tyminski</a>, cites the price of physical copies dropping in retail stores as one of the reasons for the digital versions getting cheaper, and also claims it to be part of the studio's "<em>player first</em>" approach.</p>



<p>"<em>Keeping games full price on digital stores while physical copies drop is wrong. Ironically, physical costs more per unit to make and sell. Big discounts from inflated prices look better — but that’s not real value.</em> <em>We’re slashing prices across the entire CI Games catalog — and we’re committed to keeping it that way. Fair pricing. Players first.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Lords of the Fallen is now permanently $29.99 (was $69.99 console / $59.99 PC).</p><p>Keeping games full price on digital stores while physical copies drop is wrong.<br>Ironically, physical costs more per unit to make and sell.</p><p>Big discounts from inflated prices look better — but that’s… <a href="https://t.co/FIMeRJ0UZT">pic.twitter.com/FIMeRJ0UZT</a></p></div>— Marek Tyminski (@tyminski_marek) <a href="https://twitter.com/tyminski_marek/status/1951319064116179355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>When Lords of the Fallen launched in 2023, it did so in a poor state, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">with our reviewer,</a> Francesco De Meo, saying that he "<em>was disappointed to see how the game failed to deliver an enjoyable experience. Some die-hard Souls series fans may find some enjoyment in the 35 or so hours-long journey to save Mournstead, but everyone else likely won't be able to see past the game's many shortcomings."</em></p>



<p>A 2.0 update that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">arrived earlier this year</a> marked a huge improvement, and the game has still been able to surpass <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-reaches-more-than-5-5-million-players/">5.5 million players since launch</a>, but it's definitely not been the journey that Tyminski and the rest of CI Games would have envisioned. </p>



<p>At least the price cuts are a tangible way for CI Games to show its players that it is committed to giving them a product that is worth what they paid for it.</p>

                <p>An official Blizzard forum post has warned players of the perils of buying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> gold from a third party. However, Blizzard's reminder that you can instead buy gold officially hasn't gone over well with some in the WoW community.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW community manager Kaivax recently <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/buying-gold-from-third-parties-is-forbidden/2139797" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reminded</a> players that buying gold from a third-party seller puts a user's account at risk of being hacked, and that players should protect their account and help to maintain a fair gaming environment by shunning the practice.</p><p dir="ltr">"Purchasing gold from other players puts your account at risk of being hacked and supports companies that steal accounts, operate bots, and disrupt the game economy," Kaivax states.</p><p dir="ltr">Buying gold from a third-party seller is also against WoW's end user license agreement. Those who do could have that illegally acquired gold removed by Blizzard or have their account permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players should never buy gold from other players with real money," Kaivax states. "Remember--you should only accept gold from players that you know, or through crafting or profession agreements made using in-game chat. Always avoid gold trades intended to cross game variants, realms, or factions that are not explicitly supported by the game."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fairly standard account-safety PSA that isn't out of the ordinary. But it's the last sentence of the post that has riled up some in the WoW community on places like the forums and on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-wants-players-to-remember-the-wow-token-is-the-only-safe-way-to-buy-377946#comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, as Blizzard goes from offering information players can use to protect their account to what comes across as Blizzard trying to sell a product.</p><p dir="ltr">"The only safe way to purchase gold is via the WoW Token, which provides a convenient and sanctioned exchange of gold for game time or Battle.net balance directly through the in-game auction house," the forum post concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard introduced the WoW Token back in 2015 as part of the game's Warlords of Draenor expansion. A player can buy a WoW Token directly from Blizzard for $20. That token can then be sold on the game's auction house in exchange for gold. The player buying the token can then use that token to pay for 30 days of game time or add it to their Battle.net balance.</p><p dir="ltr">The post has ruffled feathers for a few reasons. For starters, it comes off as an advertisement for the WoW Token, which has long been a controversial addition to the MMO. In recent years the WoW community has argued whether the fact that players can officially buy as much gold as they want from Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-cant-decide-whether-or-not-the-game-is-pay-to-win/1100-6494862/" data-ref-id="1100-6494862">makes the game "pay-to-win."</a> Money, as they say, is power, and with unlimited gold a player can buy many of the best items, rare mounts, or pay other players to run them through content in order to reap lucrative rewards. Blizzard isn't selling players power directly, but they are in a roundabout way by letting players buy gold instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players would like to see the WoW Token removed entirely. Others would like to see Blizzard do more to combat bots and account-scammers outside of offering its own, legally sanctioned way to buy gold.</p><p dir="ltr">Another issue is that, as many in the replies to the forum post point out, some players are unable to buy the WoW Token in their region or in their preferred version of WoW. Some players on the forums state they play in Brazil and have no way to buy the WoW Token, as it's not supported in the country, while others state they play one of the many versions of WoW Classic, which don't support the WoW Token. Blizzard's post encouraging players to buy gold officially, despite many being unable to do so due to where they live or the version of WoW they play, comes across as tone deaf to some.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does regularly ban bots, and even occasionally makes in-game changes to make botting more difficult. In 2023, it banned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-is-making-it-harder-to-create-death-knights/1100-6512418/" data-ref-id="1100-6512418">120,000 "malicious accounts"</a> that were using the ability to make high-level Death Knight characters in Wrath of the Lich King Classic for botting, and added restrictions to new accounts to prevent them from doing so. At the time, Blizzard said it regularly bans tens of thousands of accounts per week.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">Midnight, will be fully revealed at Gamescom</a>. The expansion will introduce the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">player housing feature</a> to the MMO.</p>

                <p>The Sims 4 keeps on chugging along after more than a decade, and all the signs from the powers-that-be at Electronic Arts indicate nothing will change on that front any time soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> is here to stay, and if EA ever decides to move on to a Sims 5, it won't be in the foreseeable future--a point that was made pretty explicit by Laura Miele, who serves as EA's boss of non-sports games, in a chat with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>.</p><p>"What I wouldn't want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years," Miele told the trade publication. "We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on The Sims 4, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community."</p><p>Instead of replacing The Sims 4, EA will build on the existing foundation and expand the greater Sims ecosystem with the multiplayer-focused Project Rene and other projects.</p><p>"What we’re doing is upgrading and refreshing all this technology, and we’ll be adding modes of play — but we also are going to be creating and updating the base technology and the base user experience on the core game," Miele said.</p><p>"So you’re going to have this life simulation, you’re going to have multiplayer capabilities, we are going to have mobile expressions of this. We’re doing cozy games as well and more to come on that. We did a release with Nintendo on cozy games in Asia for The Sims. I see The Sims as a significant ecosystem, and a universe of multiple Sims experiences that we have to build on."</p><p>It's the bit about "upgrading and refreshing all this technology" that will likely have long-term Sims 4 players talking the most. There's a reason folks have been clamoring for a proper new Sims game despite knowing full well that a new full title would restart the DLC cycle and render <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/" data-ref-id="2900-5275">all their mods</a> defunct--they want The Sims 5 because The Sims 4 has been out for 11 years and feels very antiquated even with the regular updates. Perhaps this comment indicates that a dramatic overhaul of The Sims 4's foundation could be in the works.</p>
