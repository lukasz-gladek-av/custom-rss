<p>We shouldn't be surprised, but oof</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="SMG + SMG2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d0c3f17aee1bd/smg-plus-smg2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's store pages are live for the freshly announced, repetitiously titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, and <em>woof</em>, if you thought Nintendo was pushing it with $80 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World,</a> maybe go and fetch something to calm your nerves.</p>
<p>In the US, the bundle containing both Wii games — remastered and including extra content and amiibo functionality — will set you back $70, physical or digital. It's listed for £58.99 in the UK, although we've yet to confirm if that applies to physical too.</p>
<p>Both games are available separately (digitally) on the eShop, too, for $39.99 / £33.99 each. All versions launch on <strong>2nd October</strong>.</p>
<p><em>"But they're two of the very best games of all time!"</em> says Nintendo, probably. And absolutely, it's hard to argue with that! They're both 10/10 masterpieces. But blimey. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/01/video_does_super_mario_galaxy_2_on_wii_u_offer_anything_new">We remember</a> back on Wii U Virtual Console when these were re-released at the discounted price of £8.99 before going up to £17.99.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61242558757c5/super-mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915406.html">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lest we forget, Nintendo isn't just putting out the same old ROMs this time, with significantly more work going into this Galaxy port than last time the game appeared on Switch as part of the limited-time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> compilation (which omitted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 2</a>). These games will have some new content included. Also, although they're launching for Switch 1, a free update will bump up the resolution to 4K docked, 1080p handheld on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, though. For people who already own Galaxy on Switch who are looking to complete the set, 34 quid for the sequel is significant, however enhanced it is.</p>
<p><em>Or is it? It is one of the best video games ever made! Let us know your thoughts — and if you'll be picking one or both of the games up — in the comments.</em></p>

<figure><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b23b80c8f7138/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following confirmation that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>, Square Enix has announced that the entire remake trilogy will make its way to Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>So, this includes the aforementioned Remake Intergrade, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the as-yet unconfirmed third entry. There's no release window as of yet, but it's great to finally get official confirmation regardless.</p>

<p>It's also been confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be a Game-Key Card release on the Switch 2, so it's reasonable to assume that the two sequels will also utilise the controversial medium for their respective releases.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cozy-farming-pok%C3%A9mon-spin-off-game-pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-from-koei-tecmo-announced-arriving-2026.1296408/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pokémon Pokopia is a new spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-story-trailer-pokemon-friends-pokemon-champions/">Pokémon</a> game from Koei Tecmo, where you play as the Pokémon Ditto, who has taken the shape of a human and learns different moves from various Pokémon to build up a farm in a cozy, almost Animal Crossing-like type game.</p>



<p>It's easily one of the oddest Pokémon spin-off games in the history of Pokémon spin-off games, if only for Ditto's blank expression setting the tone for the whole game. A <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-pokopia-arriving-in-2026">blog post on the official Pokémon Company website</a> calls it "<em>Pokémon's first life simulation game."</em></p>



<p>You'll collect materials, craft items, grow crops, host more and more Pokémon, and build your own little slice of Pokémon paradise.</p>



<p>"<em>Savor the slow life as you build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for yourself and Pokémon, then enjoy a rest in your bed after all your hard work</em>," the blog post reads. "<em>As you play, the time of day and weather shift in a natural cycle, allowing you to enjoy your utopia in all its moods.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026, as no more specific release date was announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a fully-fledged Nintendo Direct presentation that offered around an hour of information about upcoming Switch 2 and original Switch games. Here's everything that was announced during that presentation!</p>

<hr><h2>It's the 40th anniversary of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=zPEF2Fx7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=VBxUKk14 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Mario Galaxy&nbsp;</em>and its sequel are coming to the Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>We kicked off with a 40th-anniversary&nbsp;<em>Super Mario&nbsp;</em>celebration, and there's lots going on in the world of Nintendo's most bankable character.</p>

<p>We're getting a sequel to the&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>movie by the name of&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, and to celebrate, the two&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy&nbsp;</em>games are also getting re-releases on Switch and Switch 2 on October 2nd.</p>

<p>We're also getting a new&nbsp;<em>Mario Tennis&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>, as well as a Switch 2 Edition for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder&nbsp;</em>that's also bringing some new stuff to the table.</p>

<p>The anniversary celebrations for&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>closed with a glimpse at a new&nbsp;<em>Yoshi&nbsp;</em>platformer,&nbsp;<em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>, which looks positively adorable. It's coming in spring next year.</p>

<h2><em>Storm Lancers&nbsp;</em>is another new action roguelike</h2>

<p>Inspired by 80s anime, this 2D action roguelike boasts solo and co-op play, and it's coming later today, so you won't have to wait long to decide whether you want to check it out or not.</p>

<h2>Aussie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum&nbsp;</em>is coming to the Switch 2</h2>

<p>That's right: the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dinkum" rel="nofollow">cozy Aussie farming sim</a> is making its way to the Switch 2, and you'll be able to check it out on Nintendo's console on November 5th.</p>

<h2><em>Popucom&nbsp;</em>has strong&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>vibes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/popucom-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=WvyendCU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/popucom-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=8iywwu_8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Popucom</em>, which launched in June this year for other platforms, is coming to Switch 2 as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got to see a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>-esque puzzle platformer that foregrounds color as one of its main mechanics. It's also got a party mode if you're up for testing some friendships.&nbsp;<em>Popucom&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2 this holiday.</p>

<h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>lives the dream in spring</h2>

<p>We got another look at the offbeat Mii life sim&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>next, and it looks exactly as weird as you'd hope. It's coming in spring 2026 to the Switch.</p>

<h2><em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection&nbsp;</em>is koming to Switch and Switch 2</h2>

<p><em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</em>, which kollects several old&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games as well as a museum of kuriosities for the franchise, is coming to the Switch 2 and the original Switch on October 30th. A physical version is launching on December 12th.</p>

<h2>Relive Cloud's fever dream in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" rel="nofollow">first game</a> in Square Enix's planned trilogy of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake&nbsp;</em>titles is coming to Switch 2 on January 22nd, so you can relive Cloud's hugely enjoyable (if totally baffling) journey soon.</p>

<h2><em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark&nbsp;</em>is every game, it's all in...it</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see something that essentially looks like every video game rolled into one.&nbsp;<em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em>&nbsp;is an action roguelike, but it's also a cozy farming sim, and it's launching later today on both Switch machines.</p>

<h2>A full release date for&nbsp;<em>H</em><em>ades II&nbsp;</em>is finally here</h2>




<p>Supergiant Games showed off a new animated trailer for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades-ii" rel="nofollow">action roguelite&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades-ii" rel="nofollow">Hades II</a>&nbsp;</em>next, and we got a full release date for the 1.0 version, which is arriving on September 25th. A physical version is also coming on November 20th.</p>

<h2>Two new <em>Kirby</em>-themed Amiibos</h2>

<p>Two new amiibo figures were announced during today's Nintendo Direct, namely Kirby riding a Warp Star and a new bandana-clad Waddle Dee amiibo. They're launching on November 20th, and they'll be compatible with&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment&nbsp;</em>launches in November</h2>

<p>More gameplay footage was revealed for action RPG <i>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment&nbsp;</i>next, and you can play as a Korok. This one launches for Switch 2 on November 6th.</p>

<h2>Hey, another&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>game is getting a remake</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=kNJv1gYZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=4aVamHHN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Another&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>remake is coming your way.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>fans, rejoice: you're getting a full remake of <em>Dragon Quest VII</em>, with new 3D visuals. It's coming on February 5th and it looks pretty cute, and what's more, it's not in the HD-2D style.</p>

<h2>Nintendo Today's getting a new theme, but also...</h2>

<p>The Nintendo Today app is getting a new <em>Kirby&nbsp;</em>theme, but more importantly, Virtual Boy games are coming to Switch 2 and Switch via the Switch Online service. You will, however, need a brand new Virtual Boy peripheral to play them. No, I'm not making this up.</p>

<h2><em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly&nbsp;</em>is getting a Switch 2 remake</h2>

<p>Spooky photography horror game <i>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly&nbsp;</i>is getting itself a remake, and it's coming to Switch 2 early 2026. Expect to take lots of paparazzi shots of ghosts to help them move on to the afterlife.</p>

<h2>The first sizzle reel!</h2>

<p>Next up, we get a sizzle reel of some games coming to Switch 2. They include <em>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4</em>, <em>Overcooked! 2</em>, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>, the latter of which is getting mouse control support. A Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat&nbsp;</em>is also on the way.</p>

<h2>Cozy cleaning vibes come to Switch 2 with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></h2>

<p>The next game in what is now the&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>series comes to Switch 2 in fall, and it'll boast all the same features as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">its PC and console cousins</a>, including new washing tools, co-op, and much more.</p>

<h2><em>Suika Game Planet&nbsp;</em>goes 360-degree</h2>

<p>Watermelon puzzler&nbsp;<em>Suika Game&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup in the form of&nbsp;<em>Suika Game Planet</em>, and&nbsp;fruit now falls towards the center of a circle as part of a new 360-degree variant on the game's core gameplay. You can check this one out this winter.</p>

<h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>release date finally revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=6Xtrw8nO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=mIRECPJ5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We finally have a&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>release date! Hurrah!</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got a long-awaited release date for&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which is launching for Switch 2 and the original Switch on December 4th. The game will also have some rather strange-looking open-world bike sections, which look...fun?</p>

<h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is getting DLC already!</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>DLC pack was revealed during the Direct, and it'll take you back to Donkey Kong's island home to find more Banandium Gems and other extras. A roguelike mode, Emerald Rush, will also be introduced, challenging you to top previous runs and set new records. It's launching today!</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>looks positively adorable</h2>




<p>Here's a rather cute-looking new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>spinoff, and it looks like it'll let you make your own little&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>worlds. It's coming to Switch 2 sometime in 2026, and what's more, you'll be playing as a Ditto in human form.</p>

<h2>New Mega Evolved forms revealed for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></h2>

<p>Sticking with the <em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>theme, <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is next, and we got to see <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-malamar-pokemon-legends-z-a" rel="nofollow">new</a> Mega Evolved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-hawlucha-pokemon-legends-z-a" rel="nofollow">forms</a> for Pokemon like Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja.</p>

<p>The game, which is due to launch on October 16th, is also getting paid DLC by the name of <em>Mega Dimension</em>, which showed off some strange-looking new Raichu designs as part of its trailer.</p>

<h2><em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair&nbsp;</em>is getting a...remake? Remaster?</h2>

<p>A new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair&nbsp;</em>with extra animations and features is due to launch on Switch 2 next year, and it'll have some new story stuff for you to discover as well.</p>

<h2><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins&nbsp;</em>comes to Switch 2 in January</h2>

<p>The latest game in the <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>series is making its way to Switch 2 on January 22nd, and the upcoming paid DLC for the game will also launch for Nintendo's console. No last-gen version, though.</p>

<h2>More info on&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em><em>: Twisted Reflection</em></h2>

<p>Capcom showed off a trailer for its upcoming RPG <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection&nbsp;</em>next, and we got to see the game in action. This one's coming on March 13th for Switch 2.</p>

<h2>Second sizzle reel!</h2>

<p>It's time for another sizzle reel now - here's everything we saw during this brief glimpse of several games!</p>

<ul><li><em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>- October 28th</li>
	<li><em>Disgaea 7 Complete&nbsp;</em>- October 10th</li>
	<li><em>EA Sports FC 26&nbsp;</em>- September 26th</li>
	<li><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>- October 30th</li>

	<li><em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>- September 15th</li>
	<li><em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>- October 10th</li>
	<li><em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>- October 23rd, demo today</li>
</ul><h2>Prepare to be majorly spooked in&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h2>

<p>The latest <em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>game is also coming to Switch 2, it turns out, so now you can be terrified without turning on the TV. Switch 2 versions of <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&nbsp;</em>and <em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>are also coming, and they're not cloud versions, but the real deal.</p>

<h2><em>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave&nbsp;</em>is the next mainline&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>title, it seems</h2>




<p>The final announcement for today's Nintendo Direct was none other than a brand new <em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>game, and it's coming next year. It looks to continue the classic strategy RPG gameplay of the franchise, and it'll boast an all-new anime-inflected story as well.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything! Join us for the next Nintendo Direct, whenever that may be, and stay tuned for all the major showcases from other big publishers as well.</p>

            <p>For a week or so now, we've heard rumblings that Valve are preventing the creators of games with "mature themes" from releasing their games in Steam early access. At least two developers have disclosed that they're affected - Dammitbird, creators of raunchy fantasy RPG <a href="https://dammitbird.itch.io/heavy-hearts">Heavy Hearts</a> (do not click unless you are happy to look at a werewolf's penis), and Blue Fairy Media, creators of <a href="https://bluefairymediagames.itch.io/the-restoration-of-aphrodisia">The Restoration of Aphrodisia</a> (do not click unless you are happy to read about lewd transformations).</p>
<p>Dammitbird have screencapped and shared a message from Steam's submissions team, via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lxozkbfj4c26">Ana Valens on Bluesky</a>. It reads: "Your app has failed our review because we're unable to support the Early Access model of development for a game with mature themes. Please resubmit when your app is ready to launch without Early Access."</p><!--more-->
<p>The Blue Fairy Media folks have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bfmgames.bsky.social/post/3lxy2nutiyc25">posted about a similar rejection message</a>, adding "we can confirm our title was hit by this as well after multiple weeks of back and forth in the review process with absolutely no mention of this policy prior."</p>
<p>Whether this is a new policy from Valve remains a little unclear. The platform holder's early access submission documentation <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess#5">doesn't make any stipulations about "mature themes"</a> at the time of writing, and there <em>are</em> mature-themed early access games currently in development, which suggests it's a recent shift of direction. On the other hand, one adult game developer, Drooskati, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drooskatigames.bsky.social/post/3lxyf5qsqps2c">has posted screens</a> of a comparable rejection message from June 2024.</p><p>Valve have yet to reply for my request for comment, sent about 10 days ago. Assuming they are now prohibiting mature-themed games from early access, all this is probably a continuation of the industry-wide crackdown on sexually themed or explicit videogames, instigated by payment processing networks earlier in the year.</p>
<p>This summer, Valve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">changed Steam's rules</a> to give banks, payment processors and card companies a say on what constitutes acceptable NSFW material. Then, they delisted a bunch of games. According to Valve, it was either that or risk payment processing partners blocking Steam transactions at large.</p>
<p>Itch.io have also been affected by the payment processor ban on "mature themes". The indie store <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">delisted thousands of games in July</a>, and are now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">seeking out new payment processing partners who are happy to deal in adult material</a>.</p>
<p>The situation has been clouded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">the refusal of various participants to take responsibility for the delistings and removals</a>. In August, Mastercard insisted that they have "not evaluated any game or required any restrictions" on Steam, while Valve contend that payment processors have told the platform holder they're acting to ensure compliance with Mastercard's policies.</p><p>I had a go at explaining the broad strokes of how payment networks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">police the definition of acceptable sex in videogames</a> last month. The short version is that payment networks often end up being enlisted as unofficial enforcers of laws and taboos around sexual material, by dint of their control of economic activity. They are horribly ill-equipped to serve this purpose, however, because they are corporations with brands to protect. If a sufficiently large or vocal group can make a fuss about the transaction of any particular type of commodity, the corps may feel compelled to pull support.</p>
<p>The enforced policy changes on Steam and Itch.io appears to reflect a new reactionary campaign against sexual themes or material in art or entertainment, and especially queer art deemed abhorrent by conservatives. The Australian lobby group Collective Shout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">have claimed credit for bringing about Steam's policy changes</a> by applying public pressure to Mastercard, Visa and others. They published an open letter in July co-signed by two religious anti-porn and anti-sex work organisations, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation and Exodus Cry.</p>
<p>Collective Shout and their affiliates have said that they're campaigning against representations of sexual violence and objectification that could contribute to violence towards women and girls. They have yet to provide details of the individual games they find disagreeable, however, or demonstrate how they are or might be harmful.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a large number of developers have been deprived of a livelihood. Eurogamer recently published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">a feature based on interviews with several of the queer developers affected</a> that is worth a read. I'll let you know as and when Valve update us on their early access policies.</p>

              <p>The next <em>Fire Emblem</em> is called <i>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s</i> <em>Weave</em>, it arrives on Switch 2 in 2026, and it’s taking fans back to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912">world of </a><i><a href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.&nbsp;</i>The strategy RPG’s reveal trailer showed students embarking on a bloody new classroom: a Roman Empire-style Colosseum.</p> <p>While there’s no official mention of <em>Three House</em>s in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264">today’s Nintendo Direct announcement</a>, house crest stones from the 2019 tactics game for the original Switch are clearly visible on some of the weapons in the reveal, suggesting <i>Fortune’s</i><em> Weave</em> will be another game set in that world. Otherwise we don’t get a whole lot of detail about the upcoming game beyond the idea that teams will be competing in Colosseum-style games while also battling other threats outside the city walls. A ruler called the “Divine Sovereign” promises to grant the wish of whoever wins the tournament.</p> <p>Here’s our first look:</p>  <p>Yes, <em>Fire Emblem</em> is back, with characters as cool and grid-based combat UI as ugly as ever. The trailer also ends with a surprise: Sothis sitting on a throne. The mysterious green-haired girl from<em> Three Houses</em> had the ability to manipulate time, and appeared in both younger and older forms. That leaves it to fans to speculate as to whether <em>Fortunte’s Weave</em> will act as a sequel or prequel to the original.</p>

 <p>Arriving just three years <a href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583">after <em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a>, it perhaps shouldn’t be too surprising that Intelligent Systems’ next entry in the long-running tactics franchise doesn’t look like a complete graphical overhaul. The cinematic animations, character art, and cutscenes all look excellent for the series’ Switch 2 debut, though I’m hungrier for a deeper reworking of the isometric battle views fans spend most of their time looking at while actually playing the game.</p> <p>Still, it’s clear Intelligent Systems is still holding a lot back about this newest entry. Given all of the cool character interactions and cozy-sim systems in <em>Three Houses</em>, I’m excited to see how those aspects of the game evolve in <em>Fortunte’s Weave</em>.</p>

            <p>
Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten Past is getting the full remake treatment, as revealed at today's Nintendo Direct stream.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the HD-2D remakes of the original Dragon Quest trilogy previously released and revealed, Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined has a new hand-crafted 3D style that expands on the pixel art of the original PS1 release.
</p>
<p>
Reimagined will also include revamped battle mechanics, a "significantly streamlined" story that's set to be pacier and more accessible, and other quality of life improvements.

<p>
Dragon Quest 7 is considered one of the high points of the series, and was one of the highest-selling PS1 games in Japan. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time it's received a remake either, as a Nintendo 3DS version was released in 2013 in Japan (and 2016 in America, Europe, and Australasia).
</p>
<p>
"Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined is a new version of Dragon Quest 7 that has been rebuilt from the ground up for modern audiences," said producer Takeshi Ichikawa on the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Square Enix blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
"When we decided to remake Dragon Quest 7, we thought deeply about the visual direction. We wanted audiences worldwide, not just in Japan, to grow fond of the charming characters designed by Akira Toriyama.
</p>
<p>
"So, in order to depict the depth and feel of Dragon Quest 7's story more vividly, we took on a new challenge for the Dragon Quest series: employing a hand-crafted art style and developing in-game environments that resembles dioramas."
</p>
<p>
Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined is due for release on 5th February 2026 across Switch consoles, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Microsoft).
</p>
<p>
It will follow Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">proven hugely successful in Japan</a>, as well as the forthcoming HD-2D remakes of the first and second games due next month.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-will-launch-january-22nd-for-switch-2-and-xbox/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has announced that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be launching on January 22nd for Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox on PC. Square Enix has also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and the third game in the trilogy will be released for Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S too, with more information for both to come at a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0eIb6WcuAeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will feature a streamlined progression setting that will allow players to get through the game faster. Each of the settings can be toggled on or off individually, with this being the list of those settings. Essentially, each of the settings make the game easier to get through, handy for those who just want to experience the story.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>HP is always full</strong>&nbsp;– your HP is at its maximum value at all times. Even when hit by an enemy, your HP won’t go down. Instant death is also removed (sorry Tonberries!)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>MP is always full</strong>&nbsp;– your MP is always at its maximum value. Sling out spells with wild abandon!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Limit gauge is always full</strong>&nbsp;– the Limit gauge is at maximum when you enter battle, and using powerful Limit Breaks won’t deplete it.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>ATB gauge is always full</strong>&nbsp;– your ATB gauge is always maxed out, so you can unleash abilities as much as you want without restriction!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Damage dealt is always 9999</strong>&nbsp;– with this set on, you’ll do maximum damage with every attack. No boss can stand against you!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-orders for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade are open too. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Review</a>, Tuffcub said, <em>“An utter joy to play from start to finish, packed with memorable scenes, moustache-twirling baddies, and epic battles. The first part of Final Fantasy VII Remake isn’t just polished, it’s opulent.”</em></p>
<p>While in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/17/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-review-ps5/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review,&nbsp;</a>Nic said, <em>“You should absolutely get Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It’s easy to be critical and nitpick, but it’s worth remembering we’re looking at the DLC for one of the best and most-loved games of the PS4. The PS5 upgrade for Intergrade looks and feels incredible, and the chance to play as Yuffie is warmly received, especially when she completely changes the tone to something more light-hearted. However, the DLC isn’t quite perfect and, despite the filler, it feels very short for its price, especially if you’re not interested in the side missions.”</em></p>

<p>To avoid any confusion the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade that is coming to Switch 2 and Xbox features the full game and INTERmission DLC.</p>

<p>It's the best one!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The really rather frightening <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</a></strong> is getting a fancy remake. Hooray! Team Ninja is involved. Hooray again! And it's headed to Switch 2 in 2026. Ok that's terrifying, but also hooray...we guess.</p>
<p>This Japanese horror effort, which scared this writer good and proper back when it released for the first time in 2003, is looking like a right atmospheric treat in its fancy new trailer, which you can check out above, and the creepy tale should benefit greatly from the added horsepower of the Switch 2, after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/project_zero_2_wii_edition">Wii port</a> back in the day that was, well it was fine, but it wasn't the best way to play it.</p>

<p>From former Bungie CEO's new studio</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We love the 80s. We love anime. We love them there computer games.</p>
<p>And so, it stands to reason, there's a fair chance we could end up loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, a rather retro-cool-looking 2D action roguelike that's available for Switch today. Exciting!</p>
<p>Today's surprise stealth drop, of a game that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/former-bungie-ceos-studio-probablymonsters-announces-storm-lancers-for-switch">announced a little while back now</a>, sees players blast through a campaign in either solo mode or couch co-op. It looks very like a 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/borderlands_collection_pandoras_box">Borderlands</a> to us in its art style, weapon pick-up descriptions and enemies, which is no bad thing, and the trailer - which you can check out above - shows a decent mix of platforming, boss battling and so on.</p>
<p>The roguelike aspect here comes through the use of "storm hearts", hence the title, which can be upgraded through play for permanent unlocks to carry into your next run. Of course this is also the first game from ProbablyMonsters, so we're very interested to see how it turns out for them.</p>

The game features what looks to be the same kind of factional rivalries that made <em>Fates</em>, <em>Awakening</em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch">Three Houses</a></em> so special. <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> also features totally new characters in a brand new setting that, so far, looks much more interesting than what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em> had to offer</a>.</p><p>At the heart of <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> is the Heroic Games, a gladiator-like contest that will no doubt have massive implications on the wider story. <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> looks to have the same tactical RPG rock-paper-scissors combat that I love about the series including new combat units that have some gladiatorial flair. We’ll learn all <em>Fire Emblem Fortune</em>’s <em>Weave</em> has to offer when it launches on the Switch 2 some time next year.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-limited-edition-nfl-echo-dot-bundles-hit-an-all-time-low-right-as-the-football-season-kicks-off.1296318/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The weather is cooling down. The leaves will be changing soon. And football season has officially begun. Any true fan it’s going to have some memorabilia of their favorite team. Most of them just sit there for display, but not this. <strong>Amazon’s Echo Dot now comes bundled with miniature NFL helmets.</strong> There are 32 different options, one for each NFL team in these limited-edition bundles. And then beyond that, you have your choice of color for the Echo dot itself, coming in either charcoal, glacier white, or deep sea blue.</p>
<p>Amazon currently has a sale going on for the NFL Echo Dot bundle, but not for every team. Between each helmet and Echo Dot color, I’ve taken on the tedious task of clicking on all 96 combinations to confirm which are on sale and which are still full price. After going through the full league, I can confirm only one set is on sale—the Green Bay Packers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/">All three color options for the Wisconsin team are $25 off, bringing the price down to just $85.</a> Cheeseheads get to live large this week. Sorry all other NFL fans in the country, but you’ll be paying full price for your team’s limited-edition NFL Echo Dot bundle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Sound, Small Package</h2>
<p>Why even get an Echo Dot in the first place? Well this smart speaker, despite it’s small stature, is capable of producing powerful sound with a rich and deep bass. It’s got a front-firing 1.73-inch speaker which pumps out room-filling audio.</p>
<p>Streaming from you Echo Dot, be it music, podcasts, or audiobooks, comes through with clear vocals. It uses lossless HD audio from a handful for streaming services, Amazon Music HD included. Beyond Amazon’s own stuff, the Echo Dot can play from Apple Music, Spotify, SiriusXM, and more. Control the volume or start and stop the track with simple voice commands.</p>



<p>Not just a speaker, the Echo Dot is first and foremost a smart home hub. You can control other smart products in your home by just asking Alexa. Use it to adjust settings on your TV. Change the lights from off to on or dim them without getting up from the couch. You can set cooking times, ask questions, create calendar events and so much more. You can even connect with family and friends who also have an Echo device or even just the Alexa app on their phone. Use multiple Echos to communicate between rooms of your house if you so please.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/">Come grab the NFL Echo Dot bundle (exclusively the Green Bay Packers edition) for the reduced price of $85.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Nintendo treated us to a lovely September Direct, kicking things off with a focus on the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>&nbsp;Where does the time go? Naturally, we saw some&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> games expected to arrive on our Switch 2s and got our first glimpse of next year’s big-screen outing for the Bros. But there was also so, so much more.</p> <p>If you weren’t up at the crack of dawn to watch it yourself, allow us to give you the rundown. Let’s get to it.</p> <hr> <h2><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-spring-2026-2000625274">there’s a new&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>movie on the way</a>. We got the briefest of looks today at&nbsp;<em>The </em><em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie.&nbsp;</em>There wasn’t a whole lot shown or revealed besides the title and a quick camera sweep through the colorful world of Mario and the announcement that several cast members would be returning including, ugh, Chris Pratt.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em>Super Mario Galaxy&nbsp;</em>&amp;&nbsp;<em>Galaxy 2</em> Arrive On Switch</h2>  <p>If you were hungry for some Wii-era nostalgia, or just <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-switch-remaster-release-date-2000625275">missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Galaxy</em> games</a> of the era, Nintendo has good news you for you as it showed off the return of these two beloved titles and some new amiibos based on these adventures.</p> <p><strong><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> &amp;&nbsp;<em>Galaxy 2&nbsp;</em>land on Switch on October 2.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></h2>  <p>Mario and tennis go back a long way, and some of his outings on the court have been pretty great. Today we got a look at <em>Mario Tennis Fever </em>which includes not just a <em>Mario</em>-ified tennis experience as you might expect, but also an adventure mode that tasks the cast with surviving a tennis-themed adventure as babies.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Mario Tennis Fever </em>arrives on Switch 2 on February 12, 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> Switch 2 Edition</h2>  <p><em>Wonder</em>‘s wonderfully surreal experience is coming to Switch 2 via a new edition. There’s a ton of new content coming to this version as well when it arrives next year. And Nintendo has produced some physical talking flowers which, um, will spontaneously talk on their own. Fascinating.</p> <p><strong><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> Switch 2 edition arrives in Spring 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></h2>  <p>Can Yoshi read? Turns out he can! <a href="https://kotaku.com/yosh-mysterious-book-yoshi-island-nintendo-direct-september-switch-2-2000625273">In <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></a>, Yoshi’s gonna have to piece together the mysteries of a strange book that’s arrived. But what’s particularly cool about this game, aside from its interesting environmental puzzles, is its quasi-stop-motion-animation style that looks really nice.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> arrives on Switch 2 in Spring 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Storm Lancers</em></h2>  <p>Played solo or in couch co-op, this side-scrolling platformer is coming to the original Switch.</p> <p><strong><em>Storm Lancers&nbsp;</em>arrives on the original Switch today.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Dinkum</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey! It’s a survival sim! You know the drill, gather stuff, watch out for—holy shit—sharks! Okay, I’m actually really into the blocky animal designs here. I think I’ll spend more time with them than the actual people.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Dinkum</em> launches on the original Switch on November 5, 2025.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Popucom</em></h2>  <p>This multiplayer-only, colorful third-person shooter puzzler looks like a neat time with friends. Hopefully you have friends?</p> <p><strong><em>Popucom</em> arrives on the original Switch this holiday season.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></h2>  <p>This weird thing. I don’t say that disparagingly. Today’s Direct showed off <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>‘s character creation and the various activities you can engage in across the island. These voices will end up in your Lynchian nightmares.</p>

 <p><strong>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches in Spring 2026 for the original Switch.</strong></p> <hr> <h2>Partner Showcase 1</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000625365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625365"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625365">© Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Following the OG Switch games, Nintendo showed off the following games, some of which we have seen before, but in case you wanted a quick rundown of the release dates, here ya go:</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkfiiLG4e0M"><em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</em></a>, arriving on Switch/Switch 2 digitally on October 30, 2025 and physically on December 12, 2025</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Adz7SlvT4"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>, arriving on Switch 2 on January 22, 2026</strong></li> <li><strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex2cdvYWB7o">Lynked Banner of the Spark</a>, </em>arriving on Switch/Switch 2 later today</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-release-date-1-0-patch-switch-2-pc-early-access-2000625272"><em>Hades II</em>, arriving on Switch/Switch 2 on September 25, 2025</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJWif3ijbVI"><em>Kirby Air Riders </em></a>(with new Amiibos), arriving on Switch 2 on November 20, 2025</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCPm1ndruFc&amp;pp=0gcJCckJAYcqIYzv"><em>Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment</em></a>, arriving on Switch 2 on November 6, 2025</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzPYFvHzx6Q"><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></a>, arriving on Switch/Switch 2 February 5, 2026</strong></li> </ul> <hr> <h2><em>Nintendo Today</em> app</h2>  <p>Nintendo’s exclusive Nintendo news app is getting a&nbsp;<em>Kirby</em> theme.

In <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, you’ll play as a Ditto disguised as a human and, hopefully, build a paradise for the poor little critters that those darn “trainers” keep abducting to force into battle. See? They don’t <em>need</em> human owners.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Pokémon Pokopia </em>arrives on Switch 2 in 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></h2>  <p>Don’t worry, if you need to exert your will over creatures we can clearly see are capable of independent, sovereign existence, <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;Legends: Z-A</em> is on the way for you to get your battles on.</p>

Try as I might to be snarky about this series, Pikachu is just too darn cute and awesome to not be tempted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371">this rad-looking DLC</a> that’s taking evolution to a new level.</p> <p><strong>A release date for this DLC was not provided.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Danganronpa 2×2: Goodbye Despair</em></h2>  <p>Waking up on a beach with a cute boy asking me if I’m okay? Hell yeah. I haven’t played this game before, but maybe you have, as it’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-danganronpa-game-is-getting-an-enhanced-remake-with-a-twist-2000625415">a rerelease of <em>Danganronpa 2</em></a>.

This may not be my platform of choice for the latest in Capcom’s legendary horror series, but I cannot wait for this game. <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and&nbsp;<em>8</em> are also headed to Nintendo’s hybrid console.</p>

 <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>arrives on Switch 2 on February 27, 2026, the same day as&nbsp;<em>RE7&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>RE8</em>.</p> <hr> <h2><em>Fire Emblem Fortune’s Weave</em></h2>  <p>Today’s Direct closed out the show with <em>Fire Emblem Fortune’s Weave</em>.

What games are you looking forward to the most?</p>

              <p>Today was the first big <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264">Nintendo Direct</a> to happen since the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873">launched the Switch 2 earlier this year</a>. 2025 is also the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> So I was excited that the pre-recorded event started with a whole section dedicated to Mario. And then I was very sad.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1819856086"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> launched all the way back in 2017</a> as a very early Switch game. And it was great. A truly wonderful 3D platformer. There wasn’t a more perfect time than today for Nintendo to announce the next mainline 3D <em>Mario</em> game. But that didn’t happen.</p> <p>Instead, Mario’s dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, came out and talked about a marathon, some ticket designs, a theme park, a lightshow, an art museum, and then revealed the first look at the new <em>Mario</em> movie. I’d be fine with all that, except after showing off <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,</em> Miyamoto said this:</p>

 <blockquote><p><a href="https://youtu.be/tpso9KkjylY?t=2039">“The movie will be the main event of the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary event.”&nbsp;</a></p></blockquote> <p>Oh… well, uh, I guess that’s one way to celebrate video gaming’s most iconic character. And don’t worry, Chris Pratt is back to voice him.</p> <p>The rest of the section dedicated to Mario’s 40th Anniversary was a bit better. <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-switch-remaster-release-date-2000625275">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2</a></em> are coming to Switch and Switch 2. <em>Super Mario Wonder</em> is getting a Switch 2 upgrade and new co-op modes. And <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> was revealed.</p> <p>But then, Nintendo had one more announcement. Finally, it was time to end this section all about Mario’s big milestone with the thing we all wanted. And then Nintendo announced… a (very cute-looking) Yoshi game.</p>

 <p>Welp, I guess no 3D <em>Mario</em> game is coming anytime soon. That’s a shame. And while I understand that<a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-roguelike-mode-out-today-switch-2-direct-2000625314"><em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> likely is the reason,</a> and that game is awesome and I love it, I can’t help but feel like Mario’s 40th anniversary event was a dud.</p> <p>Call the police. Call the Mushroom Kingdom’s law enforcement agency. Put out a missing person report. Mario is missing folks, for real this time, lost in the ever-expanding ambitions of Nintendo, a company once dedicated to games, that now has its fingers in so many other things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A trio of Resident Evil games are heading to Nintendo Switch with Resident Evil 7, aka Resident Evil Biohazard, and Resident Evil 8, aka Resident Evil Village, all launching on the same day as the new game, Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p>You can read our hands of preview of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/"> Resident Evil Requiem here</a>, and there’s a handy video as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview – First person frights, third person delights" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy.</p>

<p>Much like Resident Evil 7, and Village, Requiem will feature first person gameplay and visuals powered by Capcom’s silky smooth RE Engine. Instead of being chased by the shambling undead, Gamescom footage shows Grace and her mother escape the clutches of someone who appears to be a deranged serial killer. It’s definitely a change of direction for Resi though one that will no doubt loop back to the familiar tropes this series is known for, with fan favourite characters likely to make an appearance at some point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 2nd Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOYqFlgF6t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi gave insides on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear –&nbsp;as in, the cathartic effect of overcoming fears. He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been in consideration to be the lead character for this new game, and would certainly have been popular, so why not return to the franchise staple?</p>
<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>
<p>All three Resident Evil games will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on 27th February 2026.</p>
