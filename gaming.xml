<p>Keep on rollin'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last February, you might recall how our retro-focused sibling site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/3d-platformer-rollin-rascal-is-a-colourful-love-letter-to-sonic?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlighted a new high-speed game called <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rollin_rascal">Rollin' Rascal</a></strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiomatic/rollin-rascal">this Kickstarter project</a> – drawing inspiration from 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic</a> platformers and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario</a> – had just reached its Nintendo Switch goal, and now, well over a year later, the development team Curiomatic has revealed the title will be coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This information was shared during the developer's recent Direct-style video presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal will be released on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Rollin' Rascal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74da66cc2559/rollin-rascal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Curiomatic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the original Switch version was a stretch goal, the developer further notes how the console ports (in general) will begin production once the full game is complete.</p>
<p>There's no set release date for this title just yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2740750/Rollin_Rascal/">a demo is currently available on Steam</a>, and the team plans to roll out the game's story mode in chapters, starting with the first chapter "early next year". As for the full launch, according to the Kickstarter page, it's estimated to be delivered at some point in June 2026.</p>
<p>Here's a description detailing what exactly you can expect, and the rundown video above goes into the latest development updates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal is a love letter to high-speed 3D platformers like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> with the dynamic interactivity of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Strap in for a thrilling ride filled with speed, excitement, and a cast of endearing characters—an experience that’ll delight classic speedster fans, while also introducing newcomers to the genre!"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man was shown off at PAX West, and we had the chance to attend a press briefing to learn more about the upcoming set launching next month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before we get to the cards, there is a new official draft called Pick-Two Draft. Instead of the normal eight players, you'll only need four. And instead of picking one card, you'll pick two. This makes the matches quicker, and you can play it officially at your local game store after Spider-Man's launch.</p>



<p>So far, most of the revealed cards for the Spider-Man set have been focused on the good guys, and now we’re getting an opportunity to check out a lot of the iconic Spider-Man villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This particular iteration of The Sinister Six on Beyond the Sinister Six! shown below&nbsp;features the original cast of villains when the group first formed in the comics. There's plenty of venom shenanigans and more too.</p>

<h2>Spider-Man Bonus Sheet Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We also had a chance to see what the bonus sheet cards will be for the set. They feature some iconic comic moments from all over Spider-Man's history, often with art from artists who actually worked on the Spider-Man comics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with some new art from some Marvel artists, there will be plenty of iconic images from comic panels and covers throughout the set. Expect to see plenty of Jack Kirby, Todd McFarlanae, John Romita Sr., and a whole lot more. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>See Some Iconic Spidey Suits&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Spectacular Spider-Man is one of the central cards in the set and the Magic team has taken the opportunity to show off some iconic and maybe some more obscure spidey suits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of them are the same card mechanically, but feature different art with new suits. The backgrounds are even in the same location, but the time of day or season may be different.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Some More Spider-Man Showcase Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>With Spider-Man, the Magic team has used the showcase cards to show not only just iconic moments in Spider-Man history but storylines as well. Sagas try to tell the arc of a story over the course of the card and will have comic panels to convey the mechnanics and story moving along.</p>

<h2>The Infinity Stones Enter Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Well, Marvel is really getting into Magic: The Gathering now as our first Infinity Stone enters the universe: The Soul Stone. This will be the chase card of the set and will come in three different versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does that signal there will be more to come? They’re not saying but I think it’s a safe bet we’ll see more of the stones in future sets and some insane Infinity Gauntlet card at some point too. It’s a huge universe, and this is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-most-advanced-robovac-with-a-mechanical-arm-is-1000-off-roborock-selling-off-all-inventory-2000621455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-most-advanced-robovac-with-a-mechanical-arm-is-1-000-off-roborock-selling-off-all-inventory.1284528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock is turning 11, and to celebrate the occasion, they’ve done the impossible: offering a massive price cut on their most powerful and advanced robot vacuum ever. The iconic <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/">Saros Z70 vacuum normally costs a whopping $2,599 but is now available just for $1,599</a> on Roborock’s website during the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<p>If you’re a <strong>tech hobbyist</strong> who’s been dreaming of owning a unique robot vacuum, it’s your time. Not only is this a massive $1,000 off, but it’s also a rare opportunity to purchase it since the device was recently released a few months ago and g<strong>enerated a huge buzz at CES this year</strong>. Getting your hands on this vacuum for that kind of money is a major win.</p>
<h2>Best Robot Vacuum?</h2>
<p>The most unique aspects of the Roborock Saros Z70 is its <strong>OmniGrip mechanical arm</strong>: It’s no standard cleaning arm, and Roborock designed it to perform on different types of floors and move into those tricky corners and edges where dust settles. It cleans with precision and leaves no spot behind. Coupled with its very thin profile—less than 8 centimeters thick—the vacuum smoothly moves under sofas, beds, and other low-clearance furniture. That low profile also means you won’t need to move heavy furniture just to clean your space, which is a huge plus for anyone who hates extra work.</p>
<p>The <strong>StarSight Autonomous System</strong> navigation system on the vacuum works with a combination of cameras and sensors to map your space with great accuracy. This tells the Saros Z70 exactly where it’s already been and where it still needs to vacuum, and avoids obstacles like furniture legs and walls. It even has a double anti-tangle system that keeps it from getting caught on cables or rugs, something far too common in other robot vacuums.</p>



<p>Perhaps the strongest spec is the suction power: At <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce</strong>, the vacuum draws in dirt, dust, and debris with virtually unbeatable power. Most vacs for consumers, for instance, hover between 5,000 to 12,000 Pa, so this is a whole different story. It performs beautifully on carpets and picks up pet hair and crumbs, and it’s gentle enough not to damage wooden or tile floors. The Saros Z70 further features the <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis complemented by FlexiArm riser technology: These enable it to adjust its height and grip to offer a clean one even on an uneven surface without hurting sensitive flooring.</p>
<p>Roborock also packed in the <strong>Multi-functional Dock 4.0</strong> to ensure that maintenance is easy: The smart dock charges the device not just that, but also vacuums the dustbin and refills the water tank for mopping, and removes from you the time consumed by maintenance. It’s the optimal combination of convenience and efficiency that has your vacuum at your command whenever you are ready to get to work. It means roughly seven weeks of handsfree cleaning.</p>
<p>The Roborock Saros Z70 is a real game-changer for home cleaning, and with the price cut (from $2,599 to $1,599), it’s a deal that’s tough to beat.</p>

Players will experience progression through weekly challenge missions, unlockable Specializations to further customize their loadout, and the return of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.</p><ul><li><strong>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode</strong> – Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode has been reimagined for its return. This post-game difficulty option will challenge players through five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, applying lessons learned from past franchise entries, this mode no longer requires players to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will move up ranks through curated mission challenges that put their chosen build to the test, growing more difficult through progression and removing the need to re-farm the same gear.</li><li><strong>Firmware</strong> – Each rank of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode includes exclusive Firmware, which are set bonuses for gear that players will first experience throughout the campaign. The more firmware a player acquires results in a higher stat bonus. These powerful Firmware bonuses can be transferred once to another item, at which time the original item is destroyed and the Firmware bonus cannot be re-transferred.</li><li><strong>Weekly Wildcards</strong> – Multiple incentives will be provided to allow players to continue their search for the best loot: Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates. Maurice’s Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, with varied loot for every player’s game. Each of these activities is available for online matchmaking by intent, encouraging players to group up with friends, or find new ones whose interests align.*</li></ul><p><strong>Post-Launch Roadmap</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

In addition, this pack brings four new Vault Hunter Skins, two new Vehicle Skins, three ECHO-4 Drone Skins, as well as attachments, and one ECHO-4 Frame.</li><li><strong>Bounty Packs</strong> – With the launch of the first “Bounty Pack,” players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> universe.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-price-revealed-shockingly-low/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-price-possibly-revealed-by-gamestop-and-it%E2%80%99s-shockingly-low.1284513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been discovered by eagle-eyed Hollow Knight fans that Silksong has been listed on GameStop on Nintendo Switch for just $19.99.  This price has prompted many to believe it’s a ‘simply a placeholder’ because they can’t understand why Team Cherry isn’t charging more for one of the most anticipated games of 2025.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that users have reportedly tried to check out with Hollow Knight: Silksong in their basket at that price, but it ‘does not go through.’</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-just-19-99">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Just $19.99?</h2>



<p>In a post that surfaced on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight subreddit</a>, it was revealed that GameStop has priced the upcoming title at just $19.99.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When Hollow Knight was released way back in 2017, it came with a price tag of just $14.99, but it was a brand-new title from a remarkably small team. It was said that Team Cherry wanted to make the game accessible to more players, which is still a theme prevalent among some small studios today.</p>



<p>The lowest price Hollow Knight dropped to is around $5.99.</p>



<p>On Reddit, users started debating the price, with some being bewildered that Team Cherry isn’t pushing the popularity of the game to charge more. One user wrote, ‘I was ready to pay 40 bucks. Am I crazy? I’m not even as big a fan as you guys, but it’s been the going rate for quality games, especially if they’re a sequel to a well-loved one.’</p>



<p>Many stressed that Team Cherry doesn’t <strong>need </strong>to charge more because ‘they are really rich because of Hollow Knight.’</p>



<p>Another user pointed out how the price is potentially harmful to subscription services:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Wild if true.</p>



<p>At that price there’s basically zero reason to play it on Game Pass unless you already have it. PC Game Pass is $12 a month, Xbox is $15. A few more $ to keep the game for life is a no brainer honestly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be released on September 4 after years of painstaking waiting. Are you going to pick it up, whatever the price is? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Mai meets an 11 year old ghost, who has lost her memory and who is trapped in this world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Mai is the only one who can see the ghost, and there is a reason why their fates are tied together. Mai decides to help the ghost remember who she was and fulfill her dream so she can move on. Ironically, Mai, the living girl, struggles to enjoy life, while the ghost girl is full of vibrancy and life. Mai sets out to help the ghost, but it is really the ghost that teaches Mai how to be fully alive.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_989317"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> is at the heart of the story and at the heart of the gameplay.

It explores themes of self-forgiveness, acceptance, empathy for the struggles of others, and even romance… well, in a very innocent and sweet way.</p><p>Players get to play both as Mai and as the ghost. As Mai you help others in the village and earn good Karma to help Pim on her way. You play cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story.</p><p>Players also play as the ghost, entering the minds of everyone in the village and hearing their thoughts.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-crucial-or-wd-this-samsung-990-evo-plus-2tb-ssd-costs-peanuts-on-amazon-2000621435</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-crucial-or-wd-this-samsung-990-evo-plus-2tb-ssd-costs-peanuts-on-amazon.1284495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The internal SSD market doesn’t have a ton of options if you want a powerful drive, but Samsung is definitely leading the race right now. If you’re looking for a 2TB SSD that offers serious speed at a reasonable price point, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/">Samsung’s 990 EVO Plus just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon at only $119, down from $176</a>. That’s a crazy good deal compared to similar drives from Crucial or WD_Black that go for $129 to $189 right now. Plus, it’s getting <strong>rave reviews with a solid 4.8 out of 5 stars</strong>, so it’s definitely worth a look.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Speed</h2>
<p>This Samsung 990 EVO Plus has a <strong>PCIe Gen 4×4 interface</strong> and features <strong>read speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s</strong>. What does that do for you? Quick game loading, quick file transfer, and apps in a flash, cutting down on waiting time big time. It’s an M.2 2280 size, basically saying it will be compatible with nearly any new laptop or desktop available. Samsung also uses something called HMB Technology which allows the drive to manage its memory smoothly.</p>
<p>The drive also has Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 which boosts write speeds when you most need them. That’s a nice little kick when you’re copying data or moving files around, so the whole system feels nippier as time goes on while the drive smartly learns about how you use it. This’s not necessarily about raw speed: it’s about keeping your system responsive and efficient. And let’s be honest, Samsung’s all about quality, so this SSD is well-ventilated and won’t drain your battery even if you’re using it hard.</p>



<p>Worried about how long it will last? This SSD is built to endure. It includes a high Total Bytes Written (TBW) rating, which is just geek speak for “it can write a whole lot of data throughout its lifetime,” so you can game, work or store a gazillion files without fear. Samsung also offers great software utilities that let you keep tabs on your drive’s health and optimize its performance easily.</p>
<p>At this cost and with Samsung’s impeccable track record, the 990 EVO Plus 2TB SSD is a deal that won’t leave you disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Playtonic's enhanced version of Yooka-Laylee, the aptly named <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2025-make-the-jump/">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2, this coming October 9, 2025.</p>



<p>If you already own Yooka-Laylee, then you'll be able to upgrade to this new enhanced version at a 30% discount of its $29.99/£24.99/28,99€ launch price, and for those looking to collect a physical copy, you'll be able to pick one up for $49.99, though the added cost also gives you "<em>a selection of bonus goodies exclusively for retail,"</em> according to a press release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1As5O96S4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Yooka-Replaylee is built to shine on every platform, and we’re chuffed to bits it’s on Switch 2 from day 01, it holds a special place in our hearts (and hands)</em>," said Playtonic studio director Gavin Price. "<em>It’s bigger, brighter, bolder, and packed with all the little touches we always dreamed of. We can’t wait for players to jump in</em>."</p>



<p>Chief marketing officer at publisher PM Studios, Ami Blaire, added "<em>It's rare to see a game get this kind of second life - not as a remaster, but as a true reinvention. It's</em> <em>the kind of release that reminds you why I fell in love with platform games in the first place."</em></p>



<p>Yooka-Replaylee does more than just add a fresher coat of paint to Yooka-Laylee. Elements of the story are retold, new story beats are added, the minigames of the original are removed and replaced with new isometric platforming challenges. There's new stuff to collect, revisions to camera and movement controls, a new soundtrack, and a new map to help you move through the adventure.</p>



<p>It doesn't necessarily feel like a remake; more like a 'take two' at the game, with how much is changed and added. We'll get to see how it compares to the first game when it arrives in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The immersive attraction, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em>, is coming to the US. The Toronto-based Vibrant Studios has announced it will be bringing its full immersive-theatre-meets-multimedia experience to fantasy fans this Fall.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.vibrantstudios.events/en/dndimmersive" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em> is a fully immersive experience where you can act out the thrill of being on a heroic adventure in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. You choose your class: Druid, Rogue, Fighter, or Wizard,&nbsp; embark on a quest from the famous Yawning Portal tavern, explore a dungeon, and face overcoming challenges.</p>

In addition to the interactive theatre of being an adventurer, the venue will include a marketplace, soundscapes, cinematic videos, <em>D&amp;D</em>-themed food and beverages, and more.

<p>The experience is open not just for singles, but for families, students, and can even accommodate school and group gatherings.

Cosplay is permitted but must not promote hate speech or be deemed publicly inappropriate.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em> isn't the first time the iconic fantasy setting has been brought to life in the US.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k26-review-in-progress.1284456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, Visual Concepts’ long-running NBA 2K series mirrors the careers of players it works so hard to emulate. Sometimes, it’s a flash of potential: a hotshot rookie catching fire after putting up duds in consecutive games. Others, it’s more comparable to a wily veteran nearing retirement – we see a glimpse of talent, that peek into what it could still be. That’s what keeps me, for better or worse, hoping for the best as I start playing NBA 2K26. It’s both flashy and old school, like a “how do you do, fellow kids” teacher who wears different Jordans to class every day, it has enough cool new kicks, fits, and gimmicks to make it a much more interesting and enjoyable experience than last year’s entry, even after spending only a dozen hours with it so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, “cool” probably isn’t the right word to describe that teacher, let alone NBA 2K26. After all, an annual sports game is obviously not going to be a radically new game, since most of its gameplay and mechanics are fundamentally similar to last year’s iteration, and the one before that, and so on. But in the context of the genre it’s made a good first impression, because several minor improvements cumulatively make such a huge difference to the whole that I’m willing to say it and risk being called a nerd. Yes, I am talking about the new-and-improved shot meter. As always, one of the smallest components in its vast hardwood floor of dribbling and criss-crossing parts leaves a massive influence on how just about everything else on the court plays out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Green and Slightly Curved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were lucky enough not to have experienced last year’s shot meter, I envy you. In place of the nightmare-inducing dial/arrow/ring design from 2K25, NBA 2K26 features a much more intuitive, easier-to-time, and infinitely better-curved bar shot meter. If you’ve heard that before, it’s because it’s similar to 2K23’s – but this isn’t entirely a reversion to that. Instead of remaining static, the new meter’s green field adjusts based on defensive coverage: if a defender is right up in your face, you’ll have practically no chance of making the shot. But if you’re open, it’ll be much easier to time the release right and make a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trust me, I’m having so much more fun shooting jumpers now than I was this time last year because I’m actually making them consistently. There is a slight tradeoff, though: because it’s easier to get greens, there’s also less room for imperfection. Meaning if you get a slightly early or slightly late timing, you might as well start running back on defense because the shot will more than likely brick. That said, I’ll take this shot meter any day of the week over a barely improved chance to make mistimed shots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I’m a big believer in the concept of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” because why ruin a good thing, right? But I’m an even bigger believer that if something is broke – like last year’s janky player movement – you b7etter get to fixin’ quick. Visual Concepts did just that because NBA 2K26 makes running, cutting, and defending so much smoother that it makes NBA 2K25’s motion feel like you were stuck running in quicksand. This is no small change because it permeates every single mode, making the entirety of NBA 2K26 feel less robotic and far more natural and enjoyable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, it makes one of my favorite new features, Go-To Post Shots, look even more accurate and realistic. Remember in last year’s review how disappointed I was that I couldn’t dominate the paint with Jokic’s or Embiid’s shimmy shake fade-aways? Well, dreams do come true because for the past day I have been spamming the Sombor Shuffle an ungodly amount of times in each match I play. It is a delightfully methodical, bruising alternative to the agile, quick-twitch motions of the typical Go-To Moves, and I will continue using it until the AI learns to stop it. Until then, it’s barbecue chicken alert each time down the floor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the bad news. What, you thought it was going to be all good from here on out? Sorry, Dorothy, but the years haven’t been kind to this yellow brick road. And by “yellow brick road,” I mean NBA 2K26’s offline-only modes. Last year, the so-called improvements to MyNBA were underwhelming, to say the least. This time, dear friends, they are practically non-existent, and, as an offline-mode truther, I am very disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 2K25 we at least had the addition of the Steph Era, even though it already felt redundant alongside two other eras in the 2010s (in addition to the LeBron Era). Are you ready to hear what the 2K26 MyNBA modes have in store? Drumroll, ple…you know what, don’t even bother. It’s called Offseason Scenarios for MyGM. These are tailor-made, long-term quests for each franchise that you must fulfill to appease the fanbase and, more importantly, <em>the owner</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These scenarios come in threes and are given out at the beginning of the offseason. But much like my issues with last year’s MyGM mode, these tasks (and many of the features in the mode itself) again feel forced and, at times, unrealistic. The RPG elements, with their perk and attribute point systems, seem out of place and unnecessary because they hardly make a difference in the grand scheme of basketball operations. At the end of the day, it’s still all about winning as many games and championships as you can. Or, if you’re on the other end of the spectrum, losing and tanking as much as possible. Overall, the whole mode feels like a side project hastily thrown together just to get that last bit of extra credit needed to pass the class.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite my problems with its offline-only modes, the fundamental gameplay tweaks show plenty of promise in what I’ve played on my first day with it. I’m especially excited to see how it looks in MyCareer with its new-and-improved storyline, as well as in the potentially wonky online gameplay of MyTeam. But after suffering through last year’s shot meter and molasses-like movement, there really is nowhere to go but up. Whether that shows in my final verdict and score next week, though, remains to be seen.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k26-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"If you are familiar with the original graphics, seeing the current photos really packs an emotional punch."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">From Calorie Mate snacks to hidden Kerotan frog statues, 2004’s Metal Gear Solid 3 was packed with varied real-life Easter eggs, even if they contradicted the game’s 1960s setting. One memorable gimmick for eagle-eyed players to spot in the indoor areas of MGS3 (and MGS2) was the posters of current Japanese gravure idols — female models who pose in revealing outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These sexy posters make a return in the remake <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> — with an added twist. If you play on Legacy Style mode, the posters are as they were in the original. But if you are playing using the New Style mode, with its modern over-the-shoulder camera angle, you’ll notice that although the models are the same, the photos have been swapped out for recent shots of what they look like now, two decades on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/50274" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a> (and previously reported on by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-updates-the-original-games-sexy-posters-with-recent-photos-of-the-same-gravure-models/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>), the developers at Konami revealed how this change came about. They say that their aim with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was to evolve the game while staying true to the core essence of the original MGS3, and recreate its jungle setting so that it looked extremely realistic. However, they also ended up making small, unexpected tweaks to the content of the original, with the gravure posters being one such tweak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apparently, the initial plan for the model posters was to use higher resolutions of the images used in MGS3. However, once the team had decided to implement a Legacy Mode and a New Mode, they hit upon the idea of changing up the gravure posters to reflect the 21 years that have passed since MGS3’s initial release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta’s creative producer Yuji Korekado (who also worked on the original MGS3) explained that for New Style mode, the team decided to reach out to the models that featured in MGS3 and ask them to send in new, recent photos. This does not mean that all the models are decked out in bikinis, though. Rather, the team asked them to simply send in pictures of how they look now. According to Korekado, every single model from the original sent in photos that span the gauntlet from sexy swimsuit shots to family snaps. “We would like players to seek out and find all the different types of photos,” said Korekado, with series producer Noriaki Okamoto adding that “if you are familiar with the original graphics, seeing the current photos really packs an emotional punch.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MGS3 also featured issues of real-life video game and glamour magazines that you could amusingly use to distract guards (the magazines featured differed depending on the region). However, Korekado said that the decision was made not to update these magazine covers, as many of the publications that popped up as items in MGS3 have since ceased publication.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toejam-and-earl-co-creator-reveals-emotional-life-sim-dancing-with-ghosts.1284420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>ToeJam and Earl&nbsp;</em>co-creator Greg Johnson has announced his new game&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which he and his company HumaNature Studios describe as a "life sim about finding joy from grief".</p>

<p>Set in a small Thai village,&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>casts you as Mai, a young girl who loses both of her parents in an accident. When she meets Pim, a ghost who can't remember who she was in life or how she died, the two must set out on a journey to "process their identities".</p>

<p>Johnson got the idea for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>following the sad and untimely passing of his daughter at just 28 years old, as well as "his family's loss of everything in the 2023 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Maui-wildfires-of-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lahaina fires</a>", according to a press release announcing the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dancing-with-ghosts-toejam-and-earl-co-creator-mai-pim.jpg?itok=Ba8F-uLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dancing-with-ghosts-toejam-and-earl-co-creator-mai-pim.jpg?itok=scITw7xM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>is a life sim about grief from&nbsp;<em>ToeJam and Earl&nbsp;</em>co-creator Greg Johnson.</figcaption></figure><p>According to that same press release, Johnson wanted to "tell a story in another culture close to his heart"; he became fluent in Thai "to communicate with his beloved Thai and Muslim family", and he was inspired by Thai "cultures and customs around the departed".</p>

<p>To make&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, Johnson sought the aid of local artists Ferrai Duanghathai and Tanta Voratawankul, as well as the Thai Bit Egg animation studio and "long-time" Indonesian collaborator Ferry Halim, so it's got some serious authenticity behind it.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms, Johnson says you can expect the "chill, sim-type gameplay of a living village" in which you'll help villagers with their problems, earn karma, and play "cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story". It's got serious&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/spirirfarer-review" rel="nofollow">Spiritfarer</a>&nbsp;</em>vibes, so if you love that game, you may well like this one too.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which gives a good sense of what the game will look like in motion, right here.</p>




<p><em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>debuts on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352700/Dancing_with_Ghosts/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch sometime next year, and if you want to help support its development, there'll be a Kickstarter campaign to contribute to in October.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/battlefield-6-dev-apologizes-for-requiring-secure-boot-to-power-anti-cheat-tools/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this month, EA <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/600785827026563959/">announced</a> that players in its <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta on PC would <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/600785827026563959/">have to enable Secure Boot</a> in their Windows OS and BIOS settings. That decision proved controversial among players who weren't able to get the finicky low-level security setting working on their machines and others who were unwilling to allow EA's anti-cheat tools to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/eas-new-anti-cheat-tools-dip-into-the-dreaded-kernel-mode/">once again</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/ring-0-of-fire-does-riot-games-new-anti-cheat-measure-go-too-far/">kernel-level access</a> to their systems.</p>
<p>Now, <em>Battlefield 6</em> technical director Christian Buhl is defending that requirement as something of a necessary evil to combat cheaters, even as he apologizes to any potential players that it has kept away.</p>
<p>"The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," Buhl <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end">said in an interview with Eurogamer</a>. "It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play: that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things."</p>
<p>Throughout the interview, Buhl admits that even requiring Secure Boot won't completely eradicate cheating in <em>Battlefield 6</em> long term. Even so, he offered that the Javelin anti-cheat tools enabled by Secure Boot's low-level system access were "some of the strongest tools in our toolbox to stop cheating. Again, nothing makes cheating impossible, but enabling Secure Boot and having kernel-level access makes it so much harder to cheat and so much easier for us to find and stop cheating."</p>
<h2>Too much security, or not enough?</h2>
<p>When announcing the Secure Boot requirement in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/600785827026563959/">a Steam forum post</a> prior to the open beta, EA explained that having Secure Boot enabled "provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process." Having access to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/how-to-go-from-stolen-pc-to-network-intrusion-in-30-minutes/">Trusted Platform Module</a> on the motherboard via Secure Boot provides the anti-cheat team with visibility into things like kernel-level cheats and rootkits, memory manipulation, injection spoofing, hardware ID manipulation, the use of virtual machines, and attempts to tamper with anti-cheat systems, the company wrote.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gears of War: Reloaded arrived on all current-gen consoles, including PlayStation ones, just three days ago on August 26, and before its first week on store shelves is finished, The Coalition and Microsoft have announced that it has already surpassed 1 million players.</p>



<p>"<em>Ending the console war, one grub at a time</em>," The Coalition wrote in its <a href="https://x.com/gearsofwar/status/1961474052557557990?s=46">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the milestone. "<em>Thank you for 1 million players.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's a solid milestone for the remaster, even if the 1 million players isn't indicative of sales figures, since a good chunk of those players were likely ones who jumped in through Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>Overall, August 26, 2025, was a historic day for the video game industry, as games that were previously console exclusives for either PlayStation or Xbox jumped the fence to the other side. PlayStation players finally got the chance to check out Gears of War, and Xbox players finally got the chance to jump into the fight for democracy and Super Earth in Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>Funnily enough, this resulted in making the <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-console-to-play-gears-of-war-on-playstation-ps5-pro-xbox/">best console to play Gears of War on a PlayStation console</a>, since the PS5 Pro is capable of delivering the best mix of performance and visual fidelity compared to the Xbox Series X and the base PS5.</p>



<p>There is more Gears of War coming, with the previously announced prequel, to the original games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-has-been-in-active-development-for-over-five-years/">Gears of War E-Day</a>, in development, and beyond the small screen of your home TV or PC monitor, Gears is headed to the big screen, with a feature film in the works. That, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-film-wont-debut-before-2027/">won't be out until sometime in 2027</a>.</p>

<p>After months of being drip-fed tiny nuggets of information regarding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, Playtonic Games has finally announced that the game will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>9th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, while a previous listing heavily hinted at the game receiving a proper physical release (i.e. no Game-Key Card), this has now been officially confirmed. Digital copies will be available via the Switch 2 eShop at <strong>$29.99</strong>, while physical copies will retail at <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who already own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a> on the Switch can bag a sweet 30% discount off the price of Yooka-Replaylee on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It's about time though, right? It's good to know that we don't have to wait too long for the release now. Our only hope at this point is that the remaster improves upon the original in more ways than one. We certainly enjoyed it well enough, but it never quite matched up to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a reminder of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Refined story:</strong> The events of the first game are relived and retold by the main characters, Yooka and Laylee. New sequences and plot points have been added throughout the adventure at key milestones, too.<br>
<strong><br>
Upgraded graphics:</strong> With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favorite buddy duo has never looked or moved better.<br>
<strong><br>
Brand new Rextro’s Arcade:</strong> The old minigames are no more! Instead you'll jump into the feet of Rextro the dinosaur and undertake brand-new isometric platforming challenges for collectible rewards.<br>
<strong><br>
New collectible currency:</strong> Capital B's inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games' most beloved sentient vending machine.<br>
<strong><br>
Build your own playstyle:</strong> Tonics are back with all new flavors! With the option to equip multiple game changing enhancements, you can truly customize your playstyle. And as if that wasn't enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer.<br>
<strong><br>
Navigate the world easily:</strong> Yooka-Replaylee introduces a brand-new map and collectibles tracker, making it easier for you to traverse the environments, track NPC and Pagie locations along with tracking their progress. We're also introducing a new character in the form of (book)Mark who acts as your warp point and guide.<br>
<strong><br>
Revamped controls and camera:</strong> The buddy-duo now has access to their entire move set from the start of the game and can sequence the moves together a lot smoother than in the original game. This, combined with the revamped camera controls, makes Yooka-Replaylee feel like a more modern, snappier experience, while also directly addressing player feedback on the original game.<br>
<strong><br>
A dreamy orchestral soundtrack:</strong> The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears!</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been a long time coming, that's for sure. I first attended a hands-off preview of the original project by Hardsuit Labs at E3 2019. Back then, I hoped to play the full game in 2021, but then Paradox Interactive boldly removed Hardsuit Labs from the project and accepted a brand new pitch from The Chinese Room, adding another four years to the development of this long-anticipated RPG sequel.</p>



<p>Ahead of Gamescom 2025, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played the game's opening missions</a> and quite enjoyed that slice of Bloodlines 2. During a convention, I got to play even further than that, but that portion is still embargoed until a later date. What is not embargoed, though, is my chat with a few key members of the development team: Design Director Jey Hicks, Level Designer Catarina Martins, and Narrative Director Ian Thomas. As a reminder, the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to launch on October 21</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and publisher Paradox Interactive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> to make 'adjustments' to the Lasombra and Toreador clans being locked behind a day-one DLC. </p>



<p><strong>How far is this demo into the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>There's a whole lot more to go. I can't say the exact numbers because right now we're trying to figure out exactly how long it is, because we've been adding in a bunch of new content recently, but currently our estimates are between people who are a fast player who doesn't do any of the additional content, maybe 20-25 odd hours and then up to potentially around 40 hours for more sort of completionists.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>This demo is just before the point where Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 opens up into a more open world space, if that makes sense. The story is quite linear up to this point, and after you return from this mission, the map opens up. Phyre gets a different role in the city and there'll be lots of different things you can look at from the map and go and interact with. Side missions, if you like.</p>



<p><strong>Are these side missions tied to specific characters?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong> Yes, exactly. Are you aware of the blood resonance system? That's how you unlock the other powers from the other clans. Each clan has a leader, essentially. They will be sending you out on various different missions, which can help you progress along with your unlocks as well. You're going to gain experience, you're going to gain resonant blood, which you can then spend on the new abilities.</p>



<p><strong>Something that I noticed in the previous demo is that when you play with Fabian, you still have access to the blood resonance, or at least the resonance events are still marked on the map. Does that mean you can unlock stuff with Fabian, too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks:</strong> Yeah, there's essentially certain people who are there for Fabian to feed on around Seattle.</p>



<p><strong>But you can't unlock any new abilities, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks:</strong> Not with Fabian, no.</p>



<p><strong>He already has everything unlocked from the get-go, then. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>Because it makes sense narratively with Fabian at the end of his life cycle, right? We don't want to boost him further just as he's about to die.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> And also, Fabian is not as powerful as Phyre.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>But he still needs to feed. And so I think what you saw were probably the people he feeds upon.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> Fabian is an interesting one because, as a detective himself, he doesn't want to break the Masquerade by feeding on people randomly. He has people that he trusts and goes back to on a regular basis who allow him to feed on them.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>It's voluntary. They're allowing him to do this.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>They're also his own detective's contacts on the street.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The idea always was that Phyre would have somebody in their head, but originally, that somebody was written as a very different character, somebody who was still called Fabian but was very different.

<p><strong>How did you come up with this idea of a vampire stuck in the head of another? They are very different, too, because Phyre is ancient and originally from the old world, and of course, Fabian is local, not to mention that he's a detective interested in the workings of the mind, whereas Phyre is much more physical.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>It started before I joined the company, actually. The idea always was that Phyre would have somebody in their head, but originally, that somebody was written as a very different character, somebody who was still called Fabian but was very different. He was much more modern and much younger than he ended up being. When we tested that, and we tried to make that work, it wasn't working. The two characters were too similar in a bunch of ways, weirdly enough, because the younger vampire was quite upset about everything that was happening, and then Phyre isn't exactly cheerful, either.</p>



<p>And so people found that that pairing wasn't really fun to spend time with. So we did quite a big change later on, we had a lot of extra story we wanted to tell and we also wanted to introduce the Malkavian clan. Suddenly we went, what if the Malkavian was the character in Phyre's head? Suddenly, it really started to work, and we found that having the old vampire who has maybe lost their humanity to quite a big extent and doesn't connect to the humans, along with Fabian, who's fascinated by humans and is really interested in how the world work, it was a really nice pairing, and that just worked for us, along with a really good voice actor. Suddenly, Fabian was brought to life and they went okay, this is the right way to go. It's quite a late change and also a brave change, I think, from Paradox's case, because they said, yes, you're right. We do need to make this change, let's take the time to do it. We are very happy with that.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>I think it was definitely a worthwhile decision to delay the game and make sure that people actually relate and enjoy the characters. We didn't want Fabian to be just another voice in your head sort of character.</p>



<p><strong>It wasn't playable before, I take it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>Exactly, that's exactly so. That took at least a year.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>Two years, really, to incorporate that change. But it was so we'd get a much bigger game as well, and it's given us more playstyles, because you get to do the detective. And it's brought in Malkavian, and we like Malkavian.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking about Malkavians, they're usually considered to be mad in Vampire: The Masquerade lore, but that doesn't seem to be the case with Fabian.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>That depends on what you think mad is. They have a twisted view and a different perception of the world. Some people call them mad, and some people call them prophets or visionaries, and that's all part of Vampire: The Masquerade lore. Some may well be crazy, but some just see the world in a very different way, and Fabian sees the world in a very different way. He sees it as if he's a detective in the 1930s or 40s. Is he? Who knows, but that's what he thinks he is.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking about the gameplay balance between the clans, I noticed that half of the clans have two clan affinities, while others have three. Are those with three designed to be more versatile?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>I'm glad you picked up on that. Yeah, with those kinds of abilities, you essentially get a discount on purchasing the ability. So yeah, you can buy way more abilities with clan affinities.</p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>That's coming from the roleplaying game.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>Yeah, 100%. We tried to be accurate to the roleplaying game with that, and if you look at the mastery rating, it is specified at the top when you're choosing your clan. That gives people just a rough idea of how difficult it is to play as each clan. Because we have the difficulty and then we have the difficulty of playing Phyre as a member of a specific clan.</p>



<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the Masquerade system in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. I noticed that when it's full, if you're completely in the red, someone appears from nowhere and stabs Phyre to death. Who is that character?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>I can't remember whether you met the character Tolly [a Nosferature vampire].</p>



<p><strong>Yes, he was in the previous demo.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ian Thomas: </strong>So Tolly is very, very efficient. He is not just an information master. He is an enforcer of the Camarilla and he is constantly watching you. When you break the Masquerade, he puts you back into torpor.</p>



<p><strong>I noticed that when you go into the red bar, but it's not full, you can slowly come back before Tolly executes you.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> If you hide from the police, if we don't do any more things in the eye of the public, then you should be able to just go back and not get dealt with by Tolly.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tolly is very, very efficient. He is not just an information master. He is an enforcer of the Camarilla and he is constantly watching you. When you break the Masquerade, he puts you back into torpor. It gets quite interesting later in the game when you're doing more missions around the city. Let's say you have to go and kill little thieves or someone who's maybe in the park. There will be witnesses, so you've got to figure out the optimal way to do that without upsetting the Camarilla.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>This system is kind of core to the very IP. It's in the name, right? You can't break the Masquerade.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>Yes. It gets quite interesting later in the game when you're doing more missions around the city. Let's say you have to go and kill little thieves or someone who's maybe in the park. There will be witnesses, so you've got to figure out the optimal way to do that without upsetting the Camarilla.</p>



<p><strong>So even when you become the Sheriff of Seattle on behalf of the Camarilla, you don't get any more leeway in that regard.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>No. The Masquerade is the single, hard, sacred law. Right now. No one is above that.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> And it's not just something that happens in the game. It comes straight from the tabletop RPG. It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter how cool you are.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>It's essential for vampires to remain anonymous; otherwise, they would just get hunted to extinction. They know that they wouldn't be able to win an open war with the mortals.</p>



<p><strong>In terms of RPG systems, I noticed that there isn't that much to loot in </strong><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</strong> <strong>besides elixirs. Is that correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>The elixirs are the looting, yes. We also have various types of collectibles that give the player lore about the world, so you can go around collecting them. Some of those actually enhance your character as well. I don't know if you have found the blue ones with Phyre's symbol. They actually give you more health as well as giving you a big chunk of experience. You will then use the experience to unlock your abilities, but the health is quite obvious: it's easier to survive with more health.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> If you take your time to explore the city, then you will eventually find some collectibles that will help you in the long run. And so, if you are one of those players who likes to explore when you're running around (I'm guilty of that), you can actually give yourself a step up because you can increase your health and experience bar. It will help you in the future rather than being the person who goes from objective to objective. I think the game is even more difficult if you go straight from objective to objective without experience, so we promote the exploring part.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>And it's fun to explore. Did you enjoy just navigating around the city and jumping from rooftops and stuff?</p>



<p><strong>Yes, especially the gliding.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> But did you dash during a glide?</p>



<p><strong>Nope.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> It gets you there so fast. So, the moment that you glide and you look like you're just about to miss a ledge or something, if you dash, you can get a natural forward momentum.</p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>There's a lot of subtleties to the movement and the combat if you want to master them. Did you discover the additional kicks and stuff like that?</p>



<p><strong>I mean, I noticed that when you unlock the Blink ability, you can aim it at a foe and it will kick them.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>I saw you doing that, that was cool. But no, actually, if you use dash and a direction and an attack, it's like if you dash backward, you'll do a knee move. If you dash to the right, you do a big sweeping roundhouse kick, and there's some more for you to discover. It's really cool.</p>



<p><strong>Maybe it could be helpful if you would put some tool tips in there.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>There are some. Also, if you take your time to read the codex as well, there's advanced combat tutorials in there. But yeah, they serve different purposes. The roundhouse kick is really good for crowd control, so if you've got a big group of enemies nearby, do the roundhouse kick, and they'll scatter off.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The decision to change that made the game so much better in my opinion. We had a similar thing to other games with using a sort of token-based combat system, where only one guy can attack me at once. It just didn't feel right. We wanted this to feel like really fast combat. It was way too easy when we had that. Just making those two changes that I just said made the game so much more fun. It's now about managing the crowd, which is a real thing that, if you talk to people who do like street fighting, the most important thing is making sure your enemies are in your field of view. If people get behind you, you're done, you're dead.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Personally, I think that the combat of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 captures the feeling of being a vampire quite well. I also like that you have to be tactical when you're feeding because otherwise, the NPCs can kill you. In most games, when you enter those kind of choreographed cinematic animations where you're locked for a few seconds, you are also effectively invulnerable to enemy attacks.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jey Hicks: </strong>We had that for quite a while and the decision to change that made the game so much better in my opinion. We had a similar thing to other games with using a sort of token-based combat system, where only one guy can attack me at once. It just didn't feel right. We wanted this to feel like really fast combat. It was way too easy when we had that. Just making those two changes that I just said made the game so much more fun. It's now about managing the crowd, which is a real thing that, if you talk to people who do like street fighting, the most important thing is making sure your enemies are in your field of view, right? If people get behind you, you're done, you're dead.</p>



<p><strong>Catarina Martins:</strong> The thing about it is that you can actually use it to your advantage. If there is an NPC that uses firearms, like the enforcer with the gun, and you line it up with another enemy who is closing in melee, they will hit them as well.</p>



<p><strong>I did notice that, and it felt great. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-medieval-vampiric-%E2%80%9Cboomer-slasher%E2%80%9D-bloodthief-arrives-on-pc-next-month.1284357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloodthief, a fast-paced, self-described "<em>boomer-slasher</em>" that puts you in the boots of a wall-running, parkouring vampire with a sword, will arrive on PC next month, on September 22, 2025.</p>



<p>If you like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostrunner-death-not-such-terrible/">Ghostrunner</a> but thought it should be faster, Bloodthief might just be the game you've been waiting for. It's made by a new indie developer, Blargis, and is the studio's debut title, and a quick look at the newly debuted release date trailer will show you everything you need to see about Bloodthief, which you could alternatively call 'speedrunner's delight.'</p>



<p>Speaking of Ghostrunner, interestingly, Bloodthief also feels like it's beating Ghostrunner developer One More Level to the punch by taking that fast-paced, melee-first style of first-person parkouring action and turning it medieval. If you're excited for what <a href="https://wccftech.com/valor-mortis-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-amazing-standout-and-one-of-the-shows-best/">One More Level is building with Valor Mortis</a>, then you can play Bloodthief in the meantime, since Bloodthief arrives in a few weeks' time, while Valor Mortis won't be out until next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Bloodthief - Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHQLPjFT6JE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I checked out Bloodthief earlier this year in fact when Blargis released a demo of the game during <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest June 2025</a>, which is still available to download and play on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533600/Bloodthief/">Steam page</a>, if you want to try it for yourself. </p>



<p>At the time, I wrote, <em>"Bloodthief is a classic, simple-looking, 2-feet-wide, 10-feet-deep kind of game. If you want to dig into the parkour mechanics and push them to their limits, what I've played of its levels so far shows that there's plenty for you to dig into. Even in the opening levels, I was finding alternate paths through the parkouring by simply thinking 'I can make that jump,' and figuring out that I could, if I was nimble enough. It's not the same one-hit-kill style combat as Ghostrunner, but it still plays within the same realm of you can only take so many hits before you have to go back to the checkpoint. I also appreciate the shift from a high-gloss, neon-light-filled cyberpunk world to a muted, medieval setting. It makes the dark red blood really stand out, and it's just more fun to watch armored knights flailing their swords and running at you at full sprint.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playtonic has announced the <i>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</i>release date, and it's being added to an October that's already stuffed to the gills with big releases.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>will be launching across PC and current-gen consoles (including Switch 2) on October 9th. It'll set you back $29.99, with a physical version also available for an extra $20 if you prefer.</p>

<p>If you happen to own <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, then you'll get a 30% discount if you buy&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>on the same platform family. That means if you picked it up on PS4, you'll have to get it on PS5 for the discount, and so forth.</p>

Playtonic says it's "peeled, polished, and power-bounced" the original game "into its final form" with this new version.</p>

<p>According to Playtonic,&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>will boast "not just...a fresh coat of paint", but also "thoughtful upgrades and joyful surprises" to enhance the original game's experience. The bat and lizard's adventure has been "carefully redesigned" to make it "more modern, more welcoming, and more joyful" for players.</p>

<p>As far as specifics go, you can expect a retooled story with new events and plot points, as well as improved visuals in both the art and animation departments. The controls and camera system have also been reworked, and the titular duo have access to all of their moves from the get-go as well.</p>

<p>Tons of gameplay improvements and tweaks are also on the way in&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, including a new map and collectibles tracker, a new currency to collect, and revamped Rextro minigames consisting of "brand-new isometric platforming challenges".</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>'s release date follows on from developer Playtonic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">being hit by layoffs back in May</a>. It's likely not an exaggeration to say that the studio is probably banking on the new game to lift both its spirits and its finances.</p>

<p><em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>launches for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 9th.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-mega-man-conspiracy-theory-debunked-2000621414</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-producer-laughed-and-said-no-when-asked-if-pragmata-is-a-secret-mega-man-game.1284348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For many months now, some fans online have suggested that <a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849">Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi adventure <em>Pragmata</em></a> is actually a secret<em> Mega Man r</em>eboot. However, <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer says it is not, even laughing about the conspiracy theory when recently asked about it.</p> <p>Fans and content creators online have spread this theory around for a while. Many point out that <em>Pragmata’s</em> cybergirl sidekick, Diana, shares a lot of design elements with Mega Man<em>,</em> with her coat lending her the robot’s signature color and her arm expanding during some moments in a way reminiscent of the Blue Bomber’s oversized blaster arm. There’s also the game’s narrative setup, which involves evil robots. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/">But, in a recent interview with&nbsp;<em>VGC</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer Naoto Oyama completely denied this theory.</p> <p>“<em>Pragmata</em> is not a <em>Mega Man</em> game,” said Oyama. <em>VGC</em> also reports he was laughing as he answered the question. He then added, “It is a completely new game from Capcom.</p>

 <p>“I was actually one of the producers on the <em>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collectio</em>n as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love <em>Mega Man</em> are passionate about <em>Pragmata</em> too,” Oyama told the outlet. “From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.”</p> <p>So that seems like a definitive no. However, I expect some fans will claim that Capcom is lying. That, <em>of course</em>, they won’t confirm <em>Pragmata’s</em> connection to <em>Mega Man</em>. It’s supposed to be a big secret, so Capcom will deny it until <em>Pragmata</em> launches sometime in 2026. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-delay-delayed-2023-2024-ps5-xbox-pc-1850531732">Remember when this game was revealed in 2020 and was supposed to be out in 2022?</a>)</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PRAGMATA – Announcement Trailer, Extended Cut | Next Gen (2022)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJxXPZGmTzY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>However, I’d argue that Capcom knows how much people want new<em> Mega Man</em> games, and if they were making one, they’d be shouting about it from the rooftops. Also, keep in mind that Capcom isn’t above referencing and hinting at other games in their new IPs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060">We saw this happen with <em>Exoprimal</em></a>, which many fans were convinced was a <em>Dino Crisis</em> game. And to fans’ credit, Capcom did include a woman with red hair in a debut trailer for the game about dinosaurs. So I’m not surprised there’s some <em>Mega Man</em> inspiration in <em>Pragmata</em>. Capcom really needs people to remember this game exists and care about it in 2026. And what better way to do that than by sprinkling a few references to something much more popular and hoping the fans take the bait.</p> <p>Anyway, even if <em>Pragmata</em> isn’t a <em>Mega Man</em> game (and I really don’t think it is), the game sounds like it might be an interesting throwback to the kind of linear action games we got back in the 2010s on Xbox 360 and PS3. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342">Here’s what our own Kenneth Shepard thought about it when he played it earlier this year</a>:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>feels a bit like a game out of time, as its gruff old man protagonist, slow-moving enemies, and brutalist sci-fi aesthetic are all evocative of the over-the-shoulder shooters from the PS360 era. Given those seemingly bygone qualities, it’d be easy for&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>to feel rote and dated, but what I played was just inventive enough to feel novel. I was super impressed with it.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Predecessor is getting it’s next big update next week. Developer Omeda Studios has announced that version 1.8 of the free-to-play MOBA will go live on September 2nd. The update introduces a new map mechanic called World Shift and adds a highly anticipated hero, Demon King Akeron.</p>



<p>World Shift is a mechanic that changes the battlefield in real time. During a match, paths, objectives, and environmental hazards can appear or disappear, keeping teams on their toes. </p>



<p><strong>“This isn’t just a visual upgrade,”</strong> Omeda says. <strong>“The World Shift reshapes strategy on the fly, demanding swift adaptation and tight teamwork.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the new mechanic, Akeron joins Predecessor as a tank/off-lane/jungle hero with a playstyle all his own. He can climb walls to strike from above and focuses on controlling areas while staying strong in extended fights. Players can tweak his passive, ultimate, and movement abilities to suit different strategies. Akeron is part of the ongoing Ashes of the Damned storyline, bringing the next chapter of the game’s story to life.</p>



<p>While those are the two major additions, Predecessor Version 1.8 also sees the launch of a new ranked season, battlepass updates, and even the launch in a new location: Japan. With the launch of the game in Japan, players will have a dedicated Asia server to provide the best connection possible. </p>



<p>Lastly, performance updates for the new with 1.8 include support for Nvidia DLSS with AMD FSR support coming later. Additional changes cover improvements to the in-game store, user interface, and mini-map.</p>



<p>Predecessor’s 1.8 Update launches on September 2nd for all players. Let us know if you plan on checking it out in the comments below.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Valkyrie Profile is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, August 29, 2025. Below, we look back at why the RPG went overlooked at the time, and what makes it still stand out as special today.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's not hard to see why Valkyrie Profile wound up overlooked in its initial North American release. Japanese publisher Enix had only recently revived its US branch, likely due to both the surge of popularity of JRPGs in the post-Final Fantasy 7 era and the success Sony had licensing and releasing Star Ocean: The Second Story globally. But it was going to be an uphill struggle to get a new PS1 RPG any traction, even one made by Star Ocean 2 developer Tri-Ace. The Dreamcast was already out, the US launch of the PS2 was less than two months away, and Squaresoft had dropped Chrono Cross, a follow-up to the beloved Chrono Trigger, a couple of weeks earlier.</p><p dir="ltr">It was my freshman year of college, the weekend just before my birthday, and I wanted a new RPG to keep me occupied between classes. I had two choices: Valkyrie Profile or Chrono Cross. After having a delightful experience with Star Ocean 2 the summer before, my gut was telling me that Valkyrie Profile was the one I should pick.</p><p dir="ltr">I have never once regretted my purchase. Valkyrie Profile was--and still is--one of the greatest RPGs of its era, a game that--despite universal acclaim from its many devoted fans--remains criminally underplayed. It's been 25 years, and there's still nothing else that captures the same magic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558972-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558972" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558972-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558972"></a><figcaption>The enhanced port Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558972-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you might surmise from the title, Valkyrie Profile's setting is built around concepts inspired by Norse mythology--with a good deal of creative wiggle room, of course. Lenneth, the titular Valkyrie, has been summoned to the service of the great god Odin, ruler of the heavenly realm of Asgard. He has learned that the mythical Ragnarok is nigh, and between that and the Aesir gods' struggle with the Vanir heating up, they need manpower in the form of worthy human souls: einherjar. Lenneth must find the worthy souls of the recently departed on the lower plane of Midgard to train and transfer to Asgard before the gods' final confrontation. There are also plenty of messes on Midgard to clean up, however--the undead seeping in from Niflheim, a rebellious former einherjar, and humans overstepping their boundaries.</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear from the outset that, in contrast to the gilded realm of the gods, Midgard is a den of abject misery. Villages exist on the brink of catastrophic collapse. Desperation has led to many partaking in dangerous activities to make a living. Illicit trades like smuggling, thievery, and even human trafficking thrive in this harsh, bleak realm, and many seem to live day to day with one foot already in the grave. You can't help but wonder if the cataclysm of Ragnarok might be a small mercy to end all the suffering that's seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Lenneth, with the gift of spiritual concentration, can sense the struggles and anguish of the departed. When she comes to take their soul under her wing, she sees what their final days of existence were like, their tragic fates laid bare. Her first recruits involve a haughty princess and a gruff mercenary who find themselves caught up in a convoluted plot by a traitorous noble--one that dooms them both. More tragedies follow. A warrior strikes a faustian bargain to cure his sister's blindness, only to perish at the hands of his inner demons. A headmistress at a magic academy finds herself slaughtered by her own husband, transformed into a monster by a vengeful student. Those are just a handful. Not every death feels undeserved, as not everyone who Lenneth recruits is a particularly good person. It's their usefulness to Odin that matters--and Lenneth can help shape them into the perfect fighters.</p><p dir="ltr">Knowledge of Midgard's geopolitical environment can be gleaned from the interwoven sagas of the departed, and while the gods generally care little about most human affairs, Lenneth encounters numerous personalities that shake up her ongoing mission. There's an einherjar who seems oddly familiar with Lenneth. Then there's Brahms, the lord of the undead, who appears to hold someone important to Lenneth and the gods hostage to prevent them from destroying him. And, of course, sorcerer wunderkind Lezard Valeth: The only thing worse than his creepy obsession with making the Valkyrie "his" are the immoral means he'll stoop to to make that happen.</p><p dir="ltr">The ever-present tragedy of Valkyrie Profile helps set it apart from most other RPGs of the era, but a lot of what makes it feel special to this day are its unique interlocking gameplay mechanics. One of these is the game's distinct structure. Exploration is largely freeform, allowing you to visit areas, recruit einherjar, and delve into dungeons when you see fit. Progression is instead dictated by a timer system: The game's chapters are divided into a set number of "periods," and actions--recruitment, exploration, resting--all have a set time cost. When you reach the end of that chapter's periods, Lenneth receives an evaluation from Asgard. Actions performed during the chapter, such as sending suitable einherjar and lost artifacts to Asgard, count towards your evaluation. Perform well, and you get rewarded. Then you move on to the next chapter. While some characters and areas only become available in certain chapters, you're usually not obligated to complete anything as soon as it appears, giving you a lot of freedom.</p><p dir="ltr">Another defining gameplay characteristic are the dungeons. These are presented as 2D, sidescrolling platformer-style affairs, laden with traps, enemies, jumps, and gimmicks. They often feature bespoke obstacles and tricks that Lenneth will need to overcome, adding an element of puzzle-solving to the platforming action. Fortunately, Lenneth has a handy little tool to help: a crystal projectile. This offers a wide variety of uses: temporarily freezing enemies, creating barriers and platforms, even refracting light or manipulating objects from afar. She can also perform advanced movement techniques by building and shattering crystals in various ways, propelling her into hidden enclaves (and allowing for some fun speed tech).</p><p dir="ltr">But Valkyrie Profile's most memorably distinctive element is its combat. Tri-Ace's previous Star Ocean games added an element of action gameplay to the usual RPG proceedings, and Valkyrie Profile does something similar in concept, yet entirely different in execution. Each turn of combat sees you controlling four characters, one assigned to each face button. Depending on the weapons you've equipped, each character will have access to certain set attacks, which they will execute when you press a button. Some attacks have special properties, such as breaking an enemy's guard or launching them airborne for juggles. Land enough hits in a turn and you'll fill a gauge, allowing you to unleash one of your party member's ultimate attacks. With some strategy and practice, you can learn to chain combos and supers similarly to the way you would in a fighting game.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the enemies won't always make it easy--they'll guard, parry, and sidestep when they can, upsetting your combat flow and making them much more challenging to slay. Observing and figuring out the properties of your attacks--how they hit, how many hits they have, if they can juggle or damage enemies on the ground--is crucial to both defeat strong enemies and earn lots of post-combat rewards. Learning how the enemies react to your attacks and conduct offense on their turn is important, as well, since you can also dodge, counter, and guard, provided you've got the appropriate skills. As cool as this might sound, I'm actually oversimplifying the combat: There's a tremendous amount of skill and nuance here that will challenge RPG vets and seasoned action-game players alike.</p><p dir="ltr">An in-depth skill system bolsters Valkyrie Profile's gameplay depth. Not only does learning skills help characters in combat, but they also raise characters' Hero Value and give them positive traits, making them more suitable for service in Valhalla. Passive character skills grant stat boosts, remove negative character traits, and tend to come as specific requests from the gods. Combat skills include auto-heals and low-HP survival techniques, counterattacks, added effects to normal strikes (like splash damage and extra hits), and powerful techniques to catch enemies unaware.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558973-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558973" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558973-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558973"></a><figcaption>The enhanced port Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4558973-valkyrie_profile__lenneth_3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>WARNING: Spoilers for Valkyrie Profile's ending, including its true ending, follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Everything culminates in the game's final chapter, where Lenneth leads the einherjar in an assault on the Vanir stronghold. When she emerges triumphant, you might expect a glorious celebration in Valhalla. But that's not what you get. The ending you receive for this stellar performance is… bland. And short. Eerily so, as if there's something being hidden from you. And there is! Valkyrie Profile is a multi-ending game, and part of why it remains so strongly in the memory of players is the trick it pulls on them.</p><p dir="ltr">The key to obtaining the true, best ending in the game is a radical departure from what players are often led to expect. It's easy to assume that performing the tasks the game sets out for you exceptionally well would yield greater rewards, and thus, a better ending. But that's not what Valkyrie Profile does. Instead, Valkyrie Profile wants you to question and doubt your assigned task.</p><p dir="ltr">There are hints throughout that Odin and the gods are not entirely noble, seeing humanity as merely useful tools for their battle and service. By strictly following the orders that Odin has given her, Lenneth plays right into his hands, acting as his obedient pawn. But what if Lenneth disobeyed? Obviously, outright rebellion under the watchful eye of a powerful god would put her directly in his crosshairs for elimination.</p><p dir="ltr">What the player must do to free Lenneth from Odin's control is stage small acts of rebellion over time: sending up only the required number of einherjar, deciding to keep some of the gods' sacred treasures found in dungeons, visiting places tied to a forgotten past. Even the simple act of removing the ring Odin bestowed upon Lenneth when consulting with Asgard between chapters will help break his sway over her. Lower the Seal Value enough, and when you enter a certain area in Chapter 7, a series of dramatic events will occur, ushering in a moment of reckoning for Lenneth with the fate of all the realms hanging in the balance.</p><p dir="ltr">The unique requirements to access this ending was quite a shock to players when the game first released, and even now, it stands out. We're conditioned to do what we're told will get us praise and rewards in games, rarely stopping to question why we're doing it. Valkyrie Profile, in contrast, only reveals the full truth about its world to those who deliberately and defiantly play around its core systems.</p><p dir="ltr">Valkyrie Profile has had sequels, spin-offs, and spiritual successors, as well as giving inspiration to many games that followed. Some of these games have been excellent in their own right, others not so much. But all of the games that have come since have deviated in some way from the original gameplay elements that helped make Valkyrie Profile the fantastic experience that it is. Perhaps it's just a case of lighting in a bottle--the world of games and game development have changed so much since its original release that you can't recapture the same magic. That's why its lack of availability on modern platforms is so tragic: only a compromised mobile port and a PS4/5 re-release of the PSP version exist. I can only hope that changes eventually, because there's nothing else like Valkyrie Profile, and there probably never will be. When I first played it all those years ago on PS1, I was entranced. A quarter of a century later, I still am.</p>

<p>On Yooka-Replaylee's release, fans can expect the following key features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>REFINED STORY</strong> - The events of the first game are relived and retold by the main characters, Yooka and Laylee. New sequences and plot points have been added throughout the adventure at key milestones too.</li>
<li><strong>MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER</strong> - With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favourite buddy duo has never looked or moved better.</li>
<li><strong>BRAND-NEW REXTRO'S ARCADE</strong> - The old minigames are no more! Instead you'll jump into the feet of Rextro the dinosaur and undertake brand-new isometric platforming challenges for collectible rewards.</li>
<li><strong>NEW COLLECTIBLE CURRENCY</strong> - Capital B's inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games' most beloved sentient vending Machine.</li>
<li><strong>VENDI HAS PLENTY TO OFFER</strong> - Tonics are back with all new flavours! With the option to equip multiple game-changing enhancements, you can truly customise your playstyle. And as if that wasn't enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer.</li>

We're also introducing a new character in the form of (book)Mark who acts as your warp point and guide.</li>
<li><strong>REVISED CONTROLS &amp; CAMERA</strong> - The buddy-duo now has access to their entire move set from the start of the game and can sequence the moves together a lot smoother than in the original game. This combined with the revamped camera controls makes Yooka-Replaylee feel like a lot more modern, snappier experience while also directly addressing player feedback on the original game.</li>
<li><strong>A DREAMY ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK</strong> - The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Right now, and after only a short time with it, Yooka-Replaylee is something I can absolutely picture children perhaps a little younger than my own - who are 12 and 10 - whiling away some pleasurable hours with," I said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-playtonic-done-enough-to-entice-players-back-to-the-world-of-yooka-replaylee-i-think-it-depends-on-the-price">Eurogamer's Yooka-Replaylee preview</a>.</p>
<p>"There are items to collect, secrets to discover, baddies to bop and the colours are a kaleidoscope of joy. Even though overall it was relatively simple, it made me chuckle and smile."</p>
