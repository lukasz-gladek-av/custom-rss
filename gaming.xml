            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/capcom-next-summer-2024-stream-is-coming-on-1st-july/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Capcom has announced a mini summer showcase, with Capcom Next: Summer 2024 set to take place on 1st July at 11PM UK time (3PM PDT). The stream will run for 25 minutes and focus on three upcoming game releases.</p>
<p>Capcom has already confirmed what they will be showing off, so don’t <em>expect</em> many huge announcements, but you can still keep your fingers crossed for some surprises.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4">watch the stream when it goes live on YouTube here</a>.</p>


<p>They will explore the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced-by-capcom/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, which was announced yesterday and promises “a brand new look” for the newest generation of consoles.</p>

<p>There will also be updates on Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which launches on July 19. The game looks to be an interesting fusion of strategy and action as players escort a Spirit Stone Maiden through the world, trying to cleanse villages and then enlist rescued people to fight back against the Seethe. Here’s the most recent gameplay trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - &quot;Soh&quot; Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuVS2SpFQz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rounding things out, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> for iPhone, iPad and Mac will also be shown during the stream. Capcom has ported Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 4 to Apple’s platforms in the last few years – Village first arrived for Mac in 2022 before it and RE4 were ported across in late 2023 after the launch of the iPhone 15 Pro. It’s only this latest Pro model phone that is powerful enough to handle AAA games of this scale, while the minimum for Mac and iPad is to have an M1 chip, which first debuted in 2020.</p>

            <p>You will be able to arrogantly ignore the advice of your wife and councillors in whole new ways in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>, thanks to a small but mighty update to the game's message settings. Players are due to be given much more granular control over what scrolls and missives appear on their troubled monarch's war table, thanks to the free update that will accompany the Roads To Power DLC. Paradox talk about this and other upcoming changes (including a new start date) in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791465554434&amp;emgid=4188991669958508422">update post on Steam</a>. Some rulers among you will be excited by all the Byzantine bureaucracy that will headline the DLC. But real kings care about filtering information in extremely picky detail. Still don't know why this is big Crusader Kings news? Come with me, you insolent wretch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Customisable message settings is an oft-requested feature by CKIII players. If you have ever juggled organizing a feast in the castle with a war in Andalusia and a spymaster who keeps trying to poison your favourite accountant, you will know how important it is to keep a clean feed of information flowing into your hands. You'll soon be able to do that with much more control, judging by <a href="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//36033026/d98ce6080638ff63907d49d1dc72050c98d740fa.png">this screenshot</a> of the upcoming quality-of-life feature. </p>

<p>God, that's an exciting menu. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-ii">Crusader Kings 2</a> and other Parastrats like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> have long enjoyed a similar feature that lets you decide, in itty-bitty detail, which message types you think are important, and which you don't give two figs about. But Crusader Kings 3 still doesn't have those options. So you're forced to trust the game's own info-sorting, meaning you sometimes miss significant events, or get endlessly informed about dozens of things for which you simply don't care.</p>
<p>This is due to make persnickety players like myself, who want to tailor their own story, very glad. Message settings have probably been on the drawing board at Paradox for a while, given the howling cries from the masses yearning for the feature. "I hate it when I suddenly notice bits and pieces of land around me suddenly belonging to a different ruler," says one such <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/imbk3n/can_we_please_please_have_message_settings_back/">kingly wail</a>. "I found out I had grandchildren years after they had died without even realizing they were born in the first place," says another noble soul. Yes, Crusader Kings continues to have the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJvXWoHUAAAC49x.png:large">best out-of-context storytelling in PC games</a>, even when the players are complaining.</p>
<p>The free update that adds this feature isn't coming until September, alongside the release of the paid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-is-getting-two-new-expansions-in-2024">Roads To Power DLC</a>. But it's the smallest-but-powerfulest addition to the game that I have heard about for a while. Thematically, it is like choosing which of your messengers deserves to be let into the throne room, and which to dismiss with a firm breaking of the legs (to steal Nic's summary of the feature from our chat in this morning's meeting, please don't tell him).</p>
<p>The Steam post that covers this goes over plenty of other features, not to be sniffed at. Some will accuse me of burying the lede for only addressing now the addition of a new start date, for example. Players can currently start the game on the year 867 or 1066, but will soon be able to begin on the year 1178 too. That date was chosen partly because of the various scoundrels and saints alive at that time (hi, Genghis), with Paradox saying they "want to give you as many options for worthy historical figures as possible". But it's also a good time period to coincide with the new mechanics of the Road To Power expansion, they say. </p>
<p>There are yet more details, including chat about the new "Administrative government" features. But I'm not going into that. Go read it yourself to learn about changes to vassal directives (tasks your underlings must carry out, often very reluctantly), and to sip upon plenty of chat about the Byzantine Empire, a confusing realm for which I do not care. Give me Vikings or give me death (or Spain... or North Africa... or Ireland... or...)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186771/hitman-conor-mcgregor-elusive-target-ufc-disruptor-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="OadpWD">Agent 47’s next assassination target is Conor McGregor, the MMA fighter and star of this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24049549/road-house-jake-gyllenhaal-trailer-release-date-amazon-prime"><em>Roadhouse</em> remake</a>, developer IO Interactive announced Thursday. McGregor will serve as the next <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/18/16673752/hitman-elusive-targets-return">elusive target</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23537193/hitman-3-renamed-free-games-2-3-steam"><em>Hitman World of Assassination</em></a><em>,</em> and he’s available in all versions of the game from June 27 through July 29.</p>
<p id="XVYMbb">McGregor’s <em>Hitman</em> character is known as The Disruptor, and he’ll be portrayed in game as — what else? — an MMA fighter. The Disruptor is set to compete against Tim Quinn, the CEO of Quantum Leap, who previously appeared in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22237877/hitman-3-review-io-interactive"><em>Hitman 3</em></a> mission “The Farewell.” According to IO Interactive, stakeholders at Quantum Leap fear that Quinn will be humiliated by The Disruptor, and have tasked Agent 47 with taking down McGregor’s character before the match can happen.</p>
<p id="tpWQik">The Disruptor mission sends players to the island of Sgàil “during a conclave of the secretive Ark Society, an organization composed of the world’s most rich and powerful people,” IO Interactive said in a news release. The mission will be available to play for free for <em>Hitman</em> newcomers as part of the game’s Free Starter Pack. </p>

<p id="5Thxll"><em>Hitman World of Assassination</em> players can also access the mission for free, and can purchase a $4.99 Disruptor DLC pack, which offers a new fur-coat cosmetic, as well as kettlebell, resistance band, and cane items, which you can presumably use to kill Conor McGregor. That DLC pack also offers permanent access to The Ostentatious, a two-level Arcade contract featuring The Disruptor elusive target. </p>
<p id="hFWQQ2">The ability to eliminate McGregor virtually should be cathartic for the UFC fighter’s detractors, whether they’re wroth over his general attitude, his clownish performance in the unnecessary <em>Roadhouse</em> remake, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67152914">sexual assault allegations levied against him</a>, or his <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/">history of out-of-the-ring violence</a>. </p>
<p id="IxHNci">If killing Conor McGregor sounds like your cup of tea, the Disruptor elusive target mission is available starting today on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X versions of <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>.</p>
<p id="isaxAj">The Hitman series has included celebrities as elusive targets before, notably with actors <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/18/12213078/hitman-gary-busey-outer-helmet-protector-protector">Gary Busey</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/28/18113485/hitman-2-sean-bean-elusive-target-mark-faba-undying">Sean Bean</a> serving as limited-time assassination victims in <em>Hitman</em> and <em>Hitman 2</em>, respectively.</p>

Just because they can!</p><p>A content creator known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lastdarkhope9988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LastDarkHope</a> has been quietly plugging away on their YouTube channel for the last few months, defeating Elden Ring boss after Elden Ring boss with absolutely no rune levels gained, and no equipment leveled up. That's impressive enough on its own, but when the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC dropped last week, this incredible player simply started beating those bosses too. Again, this is without using runes to level up at all, and without using any smithing stones to upgrade equipment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Critically, LastDarkHope does seem to be using Scadutree Fragments. These fragments only impact the DLC content, but they do give damage negation and damage output increases that are far from negligible. As we've mentioned elsewhere on site, the Elden Ring community has been <em>really </em>struggling with the difficulty of some of Shadow of the Erdtree's bosses. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">Scadutree Fragments are the DLC's way of countering its heinous difficulty</a>, and you're very much encouraged to seek them out if you're having trouble. But it seems that even these buffs weren't enough for many, pushing FromSoftware to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-first-patch-in-update-1122">drop a patch today</a> that increases the benefits from earlier Scadutree Fragments before leveling out their buffs later on.</p><p>That said, what LastDarkHope is doing is still a wildly impressive feat. Most people who are struggling with these bosses and stocking up on Scadutree Fragments are doing so at levels well beyond 100, while LastDarkHope is still stuck at 1. No 60 Vigor, no wildly high Intellect or Strength, and no ability to wield certain weapons with specific stat criteria. What's more, they don't even seem to be going that hard on Scadutree Fragments despite collecting a few. Checking out their most recent stream, it looks like LastDarkHope was barreling around Castle Ensis with just three Scadutree levels. That's certainly lower than I'd personally be comfortable with, and I'm running around with a level 168 mage trying to sneak attack dudes with Comet Azur.</p><p>At the time this piece was written, LastDarkHope had just published a video defeating Chief Bloodfiend and seems to have tackled at least some of Jagged Peak - though no video of the very curse-able Bayle just yet. What's extra interesting is that LastDarkHope doesn't seem to have finished all of the regular Elden Ring bosses yet - ultra-hard Malenia, for instance, isn't listed, nor are the final bosses of the base game. We'll be keeping an eye on their run to see how it progresses...as well as on the certain parade of ridiculously hard runs that other content creators start to drum up in the coming weeks and months. We reached out to LastDarkHope for comment for this story but haven't yet heard back.</p><p>If this somehow isn't impressive enough for you, as we were on the cusp of submitting this story, another wild kill emerged from a different content creator and threw us for a loop. GinoMachino posted their own video of a Level 1, no weapon enhancement, no Scadutree Fragment, <em>no hit</em> kill on legacy dungeon boss Rellana. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GinoMachino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GinoMachino has been on a roll</a> performing all sorts of challenging Elden Ring feats, but this is one of their first cracks at the new DLC, with more almost certainly to come. Absolutely incredible. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This boss is just beautiful. Already one of my favourite Fromsoft bosses.</p><p>Here is an RL1, +0 weapon, Blessing level 0, No status, No Hit kill on her 🙂 <a href="https://t.co/Tc2v9WDJcE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Tc2v9WDJcE</a></p></div>— GinoMachino (@GinoMachino) <a href="https://twitter.com/GinoMachino/status/1806100130589815044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>We love talking to people beating Elden Ring bosses in cool ways. In the past we've <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">interviewed community hero LetMeSoloHer,</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-streamer-missmikkaa-simultaneously-defeated-two-malenias-with-a-dance-pad-and-a-controller">MissMikkaa, who inexplicably beat Malenia using a dance pad</a>. But if you just want to finish the DLC for yourself before reading about what others are doing, we highly recommend loading up on Scadutree Fragments even if you're level 500. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Scadutree_Fragment_Locations">Here's a guide to get you started</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The patch brings with it the Sakurajima update; Sakurajima is the new island where players can take control of a tower protected by a new faction called The Moonflowers. The island is home to many new Pals.</p><p>There’s multiplayer-exclusive content, too, in the form of an area in the Desiccated Desert. An oil rig controlled by the Rayne Syndicate is now in the ocean (here you work together with friends to defeat powerful enemies and claim resources such as crude oil). You can extract crude oil by unlocking and placing a new building, the cruise oil extractor, in certain spots around the world. The new material, Plasteel, can be made from crude oil. This is used to craft new high-tier equipment and spheres.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, the level cap is raised to 55, with new technologies available and a new upper limit for Pal’s capture bonus (10 to 12). The new raid, Blazamut Ryu, features the strongest Dragon Pal in the game.</p><p>There’s a tease for a meteorite event: “Meteorites or supplies will fall from space sometimes!” Palworld developer Pocketpair said in the patch notes, below. “There may even be an unknown Pal from outer space too...!?”</p><p>There’s loads more to the Sakurajima update, including new items, new weapons, a new merchant, Tower Boss hard mode, new cosmetics including for Pals, new buildings, a new lockpicking feature, and many improvements and tweaks. The building system is reworked and improved so basic construction should now be “much more intuitive and smooth,” Pocketpair said.</p><p>Of note: the Xbox version of Palworld now has dedicated servers, one of the big points of difference between the game on Microsoft’s console and Steam. However, there is currently no crossplay, which means Xbox and PC players cannot play together. Hopefully this is a feature added further down the line.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>Palworld launched in early access form in January 2024 on PC via Steam and on Xbox as a day-one Game Pass title. It saw enormous popularity overnight, becoming one of the biggest game launches of all time. But it’s also one of the most controversial. Developer Pocketpair has said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-says-they-have-received-death-threats-amid-pokmon-rip-off-claims"><u>its staff has received death threats amid the Pokémon "rip-off" claims</u></a>, which it has denied.</p><p>Soon after Palworld’s launch Nintendo moved quickly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modder-who-put-pokmon-into-palword-says-nintendo-has-come-for-me"><u>to remove an eye-catching Pokémon mod</u></a>, then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-makes-an-official-statement-on-palworld-we-intend-to-investigate"><u>The Pokemon Company issued a statement</u></a>, saying: "We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pokémon." At the time, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-palworld-blows-up-could-nintendo-successfully-sue-the-controversial-pokemon-with-guns-game"><u>IGN asked lawyers whether Nintendo could successfully sue</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Five is a complicated age for board games. Five-year-olds are just about old enough to play a game by themselves so long as it’s simple, and they’re often fascinated by the idea of structured play that a board game represents. At the same time, they can still find losing difficult to deal with and have very short attention spans. </p><p>To make matters worse, a lot of games you’ll find on shelves have worthy educational themes to entice parents, but kids will spot them as tiresome teaching tricks a mile off and demand something more fun. Finding the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">best board games for kids</a> is no easy task. So here’s a selection of competitive and cooperative games that are easy enough for 5-year-old children to play by themselves where the learning elements are well hidden. And often you’ll find them fun enough to join in yourself, too.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Board Games for 5 Year Olds</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#catapult">Catapult Feud</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#dragomino">Dragomino</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#fuzzies">The Fuzzies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#stomp">Stomp the Plank</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#outfoxed">Outfoxed!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#carcassonne">My First Carcassonne</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#monza">Monza</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#concept">Concept Kids: Animals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#magic">Magic Maze Kids</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#animal">Animal Upon Animal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#hoot">Hoot Owl Hoot</a></li></ul><h2 id="catapult">Catapult Feud</h2><div id="197605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Catapult Feud</h3></p></div><p>The best games for younger children thrive on a mixture of simple rules and compelling premise, and what fits both better than chucking rubber balls to knock down walls of plastic bricks? Each player constructs a castle in whatever shape they like and places a number of troop models about it. Then it’s down to hot, catapult-pinging action as they take turns trying to knock out each other’s troops to win. That’s easily enough to be entertaining for most 5 yearolds by itself, especially with the fun toy aspect of the castles and catapults. But for older or smarter children, there’s also a simple action card system for some basic strategy. </p><h2 id="dragomino">Dragomino</h2><div id="155418" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dragonimo</h3></p></div><p>A great way for kids to get into hobby games is to take a concept they’re familiar with – in this case, dominoes – and give it a fresh new twist. Here, the dominoes show different kinds of terrain. Players choose from four such face-up pieces and fit them into a growing landscape, trying to match the terrain on one or both ends with existing pieces. For each such match they get an egg, which is either worth a point or gives them the right to pick from the piece selection next turn. Fast playing with a cute them and very simple to teach and learn, it’s appealing for children while teaching them turn-taking and simple strategy.</p><h2 id="fuzzies">The Fuzzies</h2><div id="197606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Fuzzies</h3></p></div><p>Most kids love nothing more than knocking over stacks of things, so the classic <em>Jenga</em> has obvious appeal. However, Jenga has various problems for younger children, in particular the time and care needed to stack the bricks, and a problem for adults - the noise! All of these are solved with an added dash of silliness by this game, in which the “tower” is a stack of fuzzy balls, easily set up by squishing them together in the supplied storage tube. A card draw tells players which colour fuzzy they need to pull and stick atop the tower. But make any fall, and you’ll flip the card for a daft penalty, like holding a hand over one eye, for your next pull, and it’s game over if you collapse the tower.</p><h2 id="stomp">Stomp the Plank</h2><div id="197607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Stomp the Plank</h3></p></div><p>Children may be briefly disappointed by the lack of actual stomping in this otherwise delightful game featuring miniature pirate elephants, but that will soon evaporate among the sheer glee it generates. Your goal is to draw a full set of non-identical cards, and you can keep drawing as long as you like. The catch? As soon as you draw a duplicate, your elephant moves one space along its magnetic plank that’s balancing perilously on the box edge. If you stop early, though, you’ll get to add discs to the end of everyone else’s plank, multiplying their peril exponentially. A hilarious push your luck affair, this has been known to win a few adult fans, too. </p><h2 id="outfoxed">Outfoxed!</h2><div id="161850" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Outfoxed</h3></p></div><p>At 5, cooperative games where no one has to suffer the ignominy of defeat are still a great way of avoiding family arguments. And they don’t come much better than Outfoxed, a game of memory and deduction where players have to find out which of an array of foxy suspects stole the chicken pie. It’s got a neat gizmo which determines whether a given clue, such as a cane or top hat, is something that identifies with the suspect’s picture or not. So by building up visual clues about the culprit your group can slowly eliminate suspects and hone in on the criminal. But each clue risks edging them closer to the edge of the board where they escape, pushing the excitement levels higher at every turn.</p><h2 id="carcassonne">My First Carcassonne / Carcassonne Junior</h2><div id="161851" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p>The original Carcassonne is a fairly simple strategy game that’s good for older children and families, but it’s still a bit too much at 5. Instead, you can introduce kids to the same concept with this fun junior version. Like the grown-up iteration, it involves placing randomly-drawn tiles to make a network of roads crisscrossing a pastoral scene. But it flips player piece placement on its head, as when a road is complete, players put down matching color pieces from their stock. The first player to put down all their pieces wins. Visually attractive and simple to play, it’s a great way to learn basic strategy concepts.</p><h2 id="monza">Monza</h2><div id="161852" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Monza</h3></p></div><p>HABA are a German company that makes great children’s games with bright, chunky wooden pieces and simple strategies to engage little imaginations. Monza is no exception, using basic concepts to create a fast, fun racing game. The track is divided into coloured spaces and on their turn, each player rolls six colour-spot dice. They then try to plot a course around other drivers and no-go spaces matching the colours they’ve rolled to board spaces. It’s intuitive to play and a great mix of luck, excitement and a little skill.</p><h2 id="concept">Concept Kids: Animals</h2><div id="161853" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Concept Kids: Animals</h3></p></div><p>Concept is a clue-giving game for adults but it also comes in this cooperative kid-friendly version based on animals. The board is full of icons that depict things like color, size, habitat and body shape. One player has a random animal card they can’t see but other players can, and those players have to use the board icons to help the guesser get their animal. It’s a nice level of difficulty for children, plus it has an educational element and is playable without text at a time when kids are still learning to read, making it a great all-around activity for the family or for kids to play on their own.  </p><h2 id="magic">Magic Maze Kids</h2><div id="161854" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Magic Maze Kids</h3></p></div><p>Yet another game based on a franchise for grown-ups (see the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a>, btw), Magic Maze Kids ditches several aspects of the original that aren’t kid-friendly, such as silence and the thievery theme, in favour of animals collecting potion ingredients. It keeps the escalating tension of cooperating to try and move pieces around a board as a sand timer trickles down toward a group loss. All the players can move all the board pieces, but each player can only move them in certain directions: the goal is to get particular pieces to particular spots while navigating obstacles. With tutorials to teach them the game and lots of bright chunky pieces, Magic Maze Kids will provide them with an amazing time. </p><h2 id="animal">Animal Upon Animal</h2><p>Another HABA game, this one leverages a popular kid-friendly mechanic, that they’re often better at than adults: dexterity. Faced with an array of cute but irregular animal pieces, the goal is to get rid of all your pieces by balancing them atop one another in the middle of the table. A dice roll dictates your options for the turn, and instead of stacking may see you extending the stack base or even giving an animal to another player, lending some extra excitement besides the risk of a toppling pile. Best of all, unlike many games on this list, Animal Upon Animal is just as much fun for grown ups.</p><h2 id="hoot">Hoot Owl Hoot</h2><div id="161855" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hoot Owl Hoot</h3></p></div><p>As you might imagine from a publisher called Peaceable Kingdom, Hoot Owl Hoot is a cooperative game where the group win or lose together. Your aim is to get all the baby owls back to their nest before sunup by moving them along a track of coloured spaces. You can vary the difficulty level by changing the number of owls, which is a nice touch. Each player has a hand of cards which can move an owl to the next space of the matching colour, leapfrogging owls along the way by calling “hoot hoot.” But if you’re unlucky enough to draw a sun card, you have to play it and advance the timer toward the game end for some added excitement.</p><h2>How to pick games for 5-year-olds</h2><p>Even the most attentive parents can sometimes overestimate what kids this age are capable of, especially if you’re someone that’s into board games yourself. But in reality, while even small children love to play board games, most of them have only the most basic reading and maths, their attention spans are limited, and the idea of taking even the smallest step further toward planning a turn ahead is beyond them. Instead, games for this age group are best focussed on teaching them how to play a structured game: the etiquette of turn-taking, dealing with the upset of loss, and the fact that many games are designed so they can be “exploited” in some way to make winning easier. That means that, for the most part, you’ll be playing the games with them rather than leaving a group of children to play by themselves. </p><p>Two things lend themselves very well to both these criteria: cooperative games and dexterity games. In the former category, you can guide your children gently toward the expected behaviours and lay pointers for them to try and work out the winning tricks by themselves. If they manage to figure it out, they’ll be delighted, and it’s a real moment of wonder. Plus, a joint loss against the game itself is far easier to take than losing against a parent or a peer. The latter, meanwhile, is a genre where kids can generally compete with adults on a much more level playing field, as there’s often little or no strategy and small, nimble fingers can be a real match for a grown-up’s clumsy paws. </p><p>Another thing to be aware of is that a lot of games aimed at this age group are marketed as “educational”, and kids have an extraordinary built in alarm that seems to go off whenever a self-improvement activity is offered to them in the guise of fun. They’re much less likely to engage with it as a result, and these kinds of edutainment titles tend to have a short shelf-life. Remember, when it comes to young kids, almost everything they’re involved in is educational in some way, even if it’s not obviously school related.

            <p>The team at Supergiant Games has released its third patch for Hades 2.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-hades-2-patch-aims-to-underline-melinoes-distinct-swift-style">previous patches</a>, the developer has taken its community feedback into account when fixing up its early access release. Changes included within this patch cover everything from Keepsakes, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, and new UI icons to music and visual effects.</p>
<p>There are also numerous bug fixes within this patch. For example, the Hades 2 team has fixed Gold Purse (Charon) not displaying as having Expired when players would expect it to, and the Rod of Fishing indicator should no longer remain visible after you miss your mark.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>From ShadowPlay to OBS, there’s no shortage of tools and apps that can record and share your finest gaming moments and/or hilarious failures. No matter to Valve, who’ve updated the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> beta client with a replay system of their own.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As explained in this handy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Steam Game Recording guide</a>, you can either start and cease recording clips at your command, or keep it continuously capturing up to 120 minutes of video for later snipping. I’ve given the Game Recording beta a quick whirl in a few games, and while its capture quality is decent, the real reason to use it over rival tools is the video timeline that now lives in the standard Steam overlay. This grants instant access to clips even as they’re in they’re being recorded, so you can skip back and rewatch a moment immediately. As implicitly suggested by Valve’s guide, I employed this feature to replay my perishing at the hands of some knife-spamming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> bullshit merchant, quickly studying his moves in preparation for a more successful rematch. Neat!</p>
<p>Sharing is a big focus as well, with built-in buttons for sending clips to friends or across devices – ideal if you own both a main PC and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, which, by the by, the Game Recording beta also works on. Alternatively you can just export an MP4 to plonk on your own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a>, which is a refreshingly straightforward process compared to how most other game recorders like to either railroad you into online sharing, or hide your local copies in the deepest, darkest file directories possible.</p>
<p>I still feel that Valve’s effort isn’t <em>quite</em> what I personally want from a lightweight capturing tool: I find my most clippable moments in games happen unexpectedly, with little warning to hit a 'Start recording' shortcut, and while the always-on recording option would suit better, I’m equally un-keen on traipsing through two hours of footage to find a nine-second clip of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a> baddie copping a particularly funny <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-darktides-gruesome-co-op-my-greatest-ally-is-a-rock">rock throw</a>. <a href="https://medal.tv/">Medal</a>, which retroactivelycaptures the last few seconds of play on each shortcut press, is the best fit I’ve found so far, but its interface is a UX nightmare and there’s no simple 'Save as MP4' option for trimmed-down clips. Bah.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I appreciate how Steam’s recording feature is nestled so neatly into the overlay we’ve all been using for years, and that instant-replay functionality could be pretty helpful in those "Wait wuh I missed that" moments. If you fancy trying it out, just opt into Steam’s beta client via the Settings &gt; Interface menu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/little-kitty-big-city-the-former-half-life-devs-cat-game-for-his-kids-that-became-an-overnight-success<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Without a doubt, one of May's surprise hit games has been Little Kitty, Big City<em>.</em> Released on May 9, the wholesome adventure game about a cat looking for its way home has been massively successful, selling over 100,000 units within the first 48 hours of release, and garnering over a million plays on Game Pass. As of this writing, it also continues to hold strong among the top five downloadable titles on the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>The remarkably warm reception has been equally surprising to its developer, the newly formed Double Dagger Studio, helmed by Matt T. Wood.</p>
<p>Wood, whose game development career began at 3D Realms in the late '90s, spent over 16 years at Valve before deciding to break away and form his own company. Double Dagger Studio arose from his desire to challenge himself in new ways as a game developer.</p>
<p>"It was a super tough decision," he says. "Valve was a really great place to be, and going out on your own was a huge risk to take, but it was worth it to be able to have new challenges and try new things. I wanted to bring something new to the industry, work with some new people, all these different things."</p>
<p>Going out on his own also gave Wood more free time to spend with his three kids, who acted as sounding boards for his game ideas. He'd done several prototypes and experiments, but one idea that seemed to strike a chord with all of them was a game concept where you played as a cat.</p>

<p>"I made a really quick prototype, made a video, put it online, and it kind of blew up," he says. "I was like, 'Wow, people seem to really be interested in this. Maybe I should focus on it more.' That was kind of the start of it."</p>
<p>Expressing oneself as a cat, doing things as a cat, and seeing things through the eyes of a cat were interesting concepts, but the next question that arose was what exactly the player was supposed to <em>do </em>as a cat? What could be the game's objective?</p>
<p>"The concept could be anything," says Wood. "You can go in a direction that might be interesting game mechanics-wise, might be interesting technology-wise, but it could take away from the feel, immersion and spark of being a cat and connecting with people in that way.</p>
<p>"My main focus was to make sure that I could maintain and capture that spark and interest of playing as and relating to cats. When you watch videos on the internet about cats, that feeling that you get when you're playing with your own cat, just watching your cat – I wanted to make sure that existed."</p>
<p>Wood wanted the focus to be less on the design and more on player experience as well as the connections they made. Then, he needed to figure out the gateway based on that. "It took a while, experimenting and figuring out what is interesting, and how that translates into an interactive experience."</p>
<p>Early concepts for Little Kitty, Big City still had the titular cat exploring the city to find a way home, but with a stronger emphasis on survival, having to find food and resources and sleep at appropriate times. However, that gameplay style naturally brought with it certain aspects that Wood wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>"I realized that when people want to play or connect with a cat, the last thing they want is to have that cat struggle, fail, get hurt or be in distress," he says. "It's not that type of game. This is for fun and making people smile. It didn't take very long for me to realize I can't really make a good survival game interesting without putting the cat in danger. So I scrapped that."</p>
<blockquote><p>"When people want to play or connect with a cat, the last thing they want is to have that cat struggle, fail, get hurt or be in distress"</p></blockquote>
<p>Having worked on games like Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead<em>,</em> Wood definitely has experience with titles that put the player character in peril. However, he notes that when that character isn't a human, things are different.</p>
<p>"I can disassociate with all the things happening to humans in video games, them getting hurt or dying or whatever. It's no big deal," he says. "But you do that to animals, it's not cool anymore."</p>
<p>Keeping the kitty out of harm's way was imperative for Wood and his team, and they quickly learned that potential players shared their feelings. "As time went on… I had people reaching out to me, asking various questions. Parents especially – they'd say, 'We've played other cat games and the cat would get hurt, and we were really worried your game was going to be similar. We don't want that.' I would have to assure them that's not what we wanted the game to be.</p>
<p>"I really tried to focus on making a game that parents could play with their kids. That was a really important thing to me, to make a game that different ages could play together at the same time and enjoy. I want it to be an experience where everybody feels joy and they don't have to stress about anything. This is a positive game about the joy of playing as a cat. Not having the cat get hurt is super important."</p>
<p>As it is, the worst peril the kitty has to endure in the game is occasionally touching water or being gently carried out of a business by a disgruntled shopkeeper. Even if the cat should fall from a significant height, it will (as cats do) always land on its feet, no worse for wear. Instead of focusing on survival, the kitty gets to casually explore the city, interact with and help out all sorts of quirky animal characters, nuzzle the legs of passersby, knock potted plants off of high places, try and find find sunny spots for a quick nap, nibble on a fish here and there – typical kitty things.</p>

</figure>
<p>Accurately simulating such a wide variety of catlike behavior in gameplay means getting the movement right. Judging from the feedback Wood received, he and his team succeeded – and not all of the feedback was from humans.</p>
<p>"I get videos and pictures of people's cats watching the gameplay because they're fascinated by the cat's movement," says Wood. "That was something I wanted to achieve but wasn't sure how to actually accomplish other than nailing the animations."</p>
<p>Thanks to animator Micah Breitweiser, they were able to do just that. "When I started working with Micah, she was <a href="https://x.com/__MicahB__/status/1782839038531313693">able to create these animations that were so natural,</a> more than I thought I could get out of this game," says Wood. "Now we just needed to focus more on accentuating those and bringing the animations more to the front so we can showcase her work more."</p>
<p>In fact, Breitweiser's animations for the kitty raised the bar so significantly that other aspects of the character were tweaked to better compliment them, such as how the cat turned or leaped onto ledges.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Valve was a really great place to be, but I wanted to bring something new to the industry"</p></blockquote>
<p>"We would go back and revisit those, and I would redo a lot of things to [improve them]," says Wood. "I went with a system where the spine would follow the head, so now when you turn, you're basically controlling the chest, and the head and everything else follows behind. You get very fluid turns and movements cats would do as they move around. The old way was, you move around, you're turning, and then you stop and immediately go back to idle [animation]. It's kind of jarring, but common in video games. But when you're looking up close at this cat that's beautifully animated and precise in a lot of ways, it suddenly feels not as good, so I started to invest in dynamic spine animation. I think it helped a lot with making things feel more natural and less like animation states."</p>
<p>The animation could be particularly tricky when it came to the kitty making jumps, giving the game some platformer elements. However, since the kitty wasn't your average platforming character, the team had to approach its animation differently.</p>
<p>"There's all these ideal jumping arcs, timings and stuff for platformers, and they work really well in those situations," says Wood, "but we were riding that line between trying to feel a little bit like a platformer but still grounding everything in as much reality as we could. Doing those really floaty jumps that a lot of platformers do, I tried it for a while and it just feels bad when you put it in a system like this where you're trying to do realistic animations and make things feel natural."  Undoubtedly one of the biggest fears a fledging studio has is whether or not their debut title will be well-received by the gaming community. For Wood, he strove to keep his expectations tempered.</p>
<p>"You try your best to focus on all those playtests that you had where people would say good things, the good feedback you're getting," he says. "You have to find a balance between 'My game is going to tank because of X, Y and Z' and 'No, I've been through this before. I know what the focus is going to be on. I don't have to worry about these other things.' I think in the end, it didn't matter for a lot of those areas."</p>
<p>Wood was right, perhaps far more than he expected. As mentioned at the outset, Little Kitty, Big City became an overnight success.</p>
<p>"It was surprising," he says. "I had modest projections about what I was hoping to do by the end of the year, and we hit those pretty quickly. I'm really happy to hear and see that people are connecting with it and getting out of it what I hoped they would.</p>
<p>"The other thing that was surprising: I had no idea how well it would be received on Game Pass. I assumed it would fly under the radar, but I was getting emails and messages saying, 'I'm an Xbox player, I normally play racing games, but I tried out your game on Game Pass and really enjoyed it. Thank you for making it.' That's super cool."</p>
<p>Between the highly successful Stray in 2022, Little Kitty, Big City's recent meteoric rise, and Copycat coming out later this year, it seems like "cat simulator" games are becoming a hot commodity, and game developers are rising to meet demand. Wood finds himself fortunate that Little Kitty, Big City was able to get in on the ground floor.</p>
<p>"It feels like it's an introduction. 'Hey, you get to play as a cat.' The games that come out after won't be able to use that marketing point as much. It won't be as powerful."</p>
<p>As cat games become more common and less of a novelty, Wood notes that the challenge for developers will become finding ways to make future games in a similar vein unique from what came before.</p>
<p>"They have to do something more interesting, deeper," he says. "I think that there's a lot of potential in making games that you actually play as a cat that feels like a cat and not a cartoon character with a cat face and ears or as a human character that looks like a cat. It's just a normal platformer where you're just playing as a cat character. I think there's absolutely a lot of opportunity, focusing on an actual cat game, for sure. And I look forward to it."</p>

		<p>Frontier has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-manager-24">F1 Manager 24</a> will be coming to Nintendo Switch on 23rd July, day and date alongside the previously announced PlayStation, Xbox and PC versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1® Manager 2024 | Nintendo Switch™ Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1b8f0VhsEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It will be really interesting to see how F1 Manager 24 scales back down to Nintendo Switch, though the game is already pretty adaptable. Ever since the first game in 2022, Frontier has brought the game to PS4 and Xbox One, and has rather modest PC requirements as well. Naturally a big part of the game will be spent trawling through menus and management options, with the most demanding aspect to be the real time race rendering. On other platforms this is only shown at 1x and 2x speeds before switching to a track map view, so with some sensible graphics cut backs, this should hopefully be fairly performant on the hybrid console still.</p>

<p>The third year of the F1 Manager series from Frontier is bringing a new Create A Team option for the Career, letting you add an eleventh team to race alongside the ten real world teams.</p>

<p>This will let you style the team in your image, from creating the livery to negotiating sponsorship opportunities, and all the rest of the team management gameplay, as you try to chart your course through to the front of the grid. Regardless of the team you pick or create, you’ll be the Team Principal, of course, charged with managing the team’s resources, sticking to the budget cap, hiring staff to improve your performance, managing training schedules and more, and you’ll also be investing in HQ improvements to further that. You’ll have to fight to keep your best staff around as rival teams look to poach your best and brightest.</p>
<p>Alongside the career is the returning Race Replay mode, which will lift the events from the real world racing calendar and ask you to try and beat a particular challenge. The highlight in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/27/f1-manager-2023-review/">F1 Manager 23</a> was getting Alonso a win at a wet Monaco, while from the early races in 2024, it could be taking charge of McLaren or Mercedes during last weekend’s Saudi GP, following Lance Stroll’s crash and safety car.</p>
<p>We went hands on with F1 Manager 24 a little while ago. Read <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/f1-manager-24-preview-making-andrettis-dream-come-true/">our full preview here</a>, but I said, “F1 Manager is steadily growing into the role of capturing all the ins and outs of the motorsports soap opera that is Formula 1. OK, it probably won’t ever capture all the drama and snippy infighting that goes on (and that’s before Netflix comes along to cook up its own narratives), but F1 Manager 24 is bringing a good set of new features, requested changes, and general improvements to the table.”</p>

            <p>
Elden Ring player Let Me Solo Her became a legend in the game's community for single-handedly assisting others to beat Malenia a thousand times, the game's most infamous boss - even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-me-solo-her-receives-congratulatory-sword-from-elden-ring-publisher">receiving an official sword as a reward</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now they've returned for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, with the aim of assisting others on a new boss. And with that, comes a new name.

<p>
<strong>Spoilers follow.</strong>

Let Me Solo Her is now Let Me Solo Him and Messmer is the new target.
</p>
<p>
Messmer is the fiery snake guy from the trailers who resides atop the Shadow Keep. Despite being fought only halfway through the DLC, he's a tricky boss with a Malenia-esque moveset that's proving difficult for many players.
</p>
<p>
For Let Me Solo Him, though, it looks like a breeze. They've successfully learnt the moveset and rhythm of attacks and, as shown in the video in the post below, are able to beat the boss single-handedly without taking a single hit.

<p>
Let Me Solo Him is one of multiple players online who are already showing off some impressive feats of skill.
</p>
<p>
Take Shura, who's managed to defeat the second major boss Rellana without armour and without taking a single hit. Instead, they use the Buckler Parry and new Deflecting Hardtear to parry every attack - simple right?! "It's like playing Sekiro on Elden Ring," they posted on YouTube.

Another streamer, Bushy, is attempting to beat each boss in Shadow of the Erdtree with just one hit, as spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-streamer-one-shotting-bosses">VG247</a>.
</p>
<p>
Bushy began with a 100 percent completed save file and spent a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2181450323">long stream experimenting with different builds</a>. Eventually, around the six hour mark, the streamer beat Gaius in one hit with a perfume bottle build and plenty of buffing, madness spells. Then it was on to Messmer who also was defeated with laughable ease.
</p>
<p>
As for the rest of us, the Shadow of the Erdtree experience has been more like this:

            <p>Popular monster-enslaving sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> has a big new update, which introduces the game's long-promised PvP multiplayer Arena together with a new island, new Pals, new Pal skills, a new Raid, new buildings and construction options, new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> activities and items - new everything, basically. The island is Sakurajima, a place of pink blossoms and red Tori gates which is ruled by the Moonflower faction from the security of their tower HQ. As for the Arena, where players can have their Pals duel for supremacy, you'll find it in the Dessicated Desert. Catch a glimpse of all the wanton Pokenot abuse in the below trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Titled Steam version v0.3.1, the update makes Palworld's landscape a lot busier and more distracting. There are new Junkyards where you might find valuable items, monster dens where you can obtain Pal eggs, and the possibility of meteorite impacts, which may supply you with additional supplies. There are also whispers of a new Pal that lives in outer space, which you might stumble across by way of those meteorites somehow.</p>
<p>You can look forward to Medal Merchants who trade rare items for new Dog Coins, and Hard Modes for Tower Bosses, "allowing you to face them in their ultimate form". Continuing its descent ever deeper into smiling puppy-eyed dystopia, the Palworld has also just discovered crude oil: you can extract the stuff from certain spots around the world, and use it to craft materials such as Plasteel. Oil may also be obtained from Oil Rigs, strongholds owned by the Rayne Syndicate, which remind me a little visually of Metal Gear Solid 2's ocean base. There's also a new Raid, featuring Blazamut Ryu - the strongest Dragon Pal in the game.</p>
<p>In amongst the additions, Pocketpair have given Palworld's building system a rework to make it "more intuitive and smooth". You can add pillars to structures so that upper storeys don't evaporate if you accidentally flatten a supporting wall. Defensive walls can be joined up, and there's a new "axis alignment function". The maximum base level is now 25, and you now own a total of four bases, though the devs note that having several (or having a lot of Pals per base) might cause performance issues.</p>
<p>There's a new glass material so that you can build terrible see-through modernist panopticons and keep your Pal labourers under surveillance while lurking indoors. Work Pals will now use defensive facilities automatically, and there's a new private lock function for chests to stop so-called friends stealing your raw materials. There are new facilities and decorations, too, including wall-mounted signs on which you might write invigorating workplace slogans, and "Pal Disassembly Conveyors" that allow you to dispose of unwanted Pals without bloodying your hands and beginning to feel like the accursed child of Old Macdonald and Lady MacBeth. Alas, it is too late to be good, for there are always more Pals to harvest. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-skin-deep-pokemon-parody-is-part-of-a-bigger-horror-story">The Machine must be fed</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, those new Pal skills. They include passives such as Nocturnal, which lets Pals work throughout the night, and a few unique active abilities such as Raging Flame Wave for Faleris and Jumping Stinger for Menasting. It's a lot. Far too much Palworlding for one article, if you ask me - there are more tweaks and features in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4159718272378624292?l=english">the full patch notes</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down servers for its open-world racer The Crew</a> came as a blow to the game's community. But, rather than remaining defeated by this news, a group of dedicated modders decided to take matters into their own hands - and began recreating the server-side software necessary to play The Crew online once again. </p>
<p>
This fan-lead project, codenamed The Crew Revival (at least for now), currently has five members working on it. "We started pretty much as soon as Ubisoft announced the shutdown last December," team member whammy4 told Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>"It's still the same game that everyone played before, except instead of connecting to Ubisoft's central server, they will connect to ours (or a local server running on their computers if they choose to play offline)," he explained. 
</p>

<p>
While whammy4 knows that many online-only games have been shut down over the years, he believes The Crew stands out for "several reasons" as being worthy of saving. Most importantly? "It can be, and often is, played solo on your own", whammy 4 said, meaning Ubisoft "artificially enforced constant online connectivity constraints" on its players. </p>
<p>"As we know, [this] resulted in this AAA full price game being completely inaccessible for the 12+ million players who own(ed) the game."</p>
<p>
Whammy4 called Ubisoft's decision to shut down The Crew's servers "completely unacceptable", adding this type of action from developers and publishers "seems to be an alarmingly rising trend" in the video game industry. In addition to shutting down servers, Ubisoft also reportedly started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removing the game from owners' libraries</a> and revoking their user licence in the process back in April.
</p>
<p>
"If the trend continues, in a decade we'll have tons of unplayable, dead video games that people once loved and played, which is why video game preservation is extremely important, before the situation spins out of control," whammy4 continued.

<p>
This project is evidently incredibly important to the entire Crew Revival team, with whammy4 calling the original game a "unique" experience. 
</p>
<p>
"It is the only video game, even to this day, to allow the player to cruise along an open world, contiguous, scaled down yet still huge USA. To give up on such a remarkable video game would be a crime," he said. 
</p>
<p>
Whammy4 does not yet know exactly when The Crew Revival's servers will be available to the public, although he said the team hopes to have everything ready before The Crew's 10th anniversary, which is this December. When it is all sorted, however, it will be free. 
</p>
<p>
"The reception [to The Crew Revival] from people who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the game has been greatly positive, as they are happy to see the game be revived, and be preserved, like all games deserve to be," whammy4 said, telling me he believes there are "one or more" of Ubisoft's Ivory Tower developers in the revival's Discord server. 
</p>
<p>"I think Ubisoft heard enough criticisms from their customers [following the server shut down], but I have one thing to say to The Crew's community: they should absolutely not let Ubisoft keep getting away with such horrendous practices, otherwise it will just keep happening to more and more games, including The Crew's sequels, and history will just keep repeating itself," he closed. "People must not forget."</p>
<p>To stay up to date on how whammy4 and the rest of the team are getting on with The Crew's preservation project, you can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gUczTkphGE">join the revival's Discord server here</a>. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crew-review">Eurogamer's own review for The Crew</a>, Outside Xbox's racing aficionado Mike Channel came away impressed. "It's a game that requires and occasionally enforces patience, but like all great road trips it's about the journey, not the destination," he wrote.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a>'s third early access patch is of the gargantuan variety. It improves Olympian Boons, adds lots of new UI icons, reworking Keepsakes, and basically touches every aspect of the game you could possibly think of. One thing it doesn't change is how sexy the gods are, but because they're so sexy anyway, I don't think that's an issue moving forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right at the top of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/6085006571972858968">patch notes</a> there's mention of a few topline changes everyone will appreciate. Namely, many Duo Boons and Legendary Boons being offered more frequently, increases to the minimum number of Boons you'll find past Erebus, and a tweak to your Gathering Tool that grants you +1 Elemental Essence.</p>
<p>At the Altar Of Ashes a host of Grasp costs and their positions have been moved, meaning you might need to reset your Arcana loadout once you've booted up the game. As for Keepsake changes, I'm into the Silken Sash no longer meaning you lose your armour if you switch to a different keepsake. And that Olympian Keepsakes mean their respective Olympian Boons will appear more frequently, allowing for a lovely bit of synergy.</p>
<p>The Boons change log is monstrous, but there's quite a few that have been cut or are entirely new additions. Many Hexes Of Selene have also seen blanket buffs in the mana-spend department, meaning they won't hog your blue bar quite so relentlessly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are loads of major and minor bug fixes, UI tweaks, and plenty more little bits and pieces. Supergiant say that now this patch is done, they'll focus on the first "Major Update" for sometime later this year.</p>
<p>Thanks to lots of other good video games coming out this year, I've not spent as much time as I'd like with Hades 2. But I do think it's been a fantastic investment, in the sense that it's practically transforming into a totally different game with these colossal patches. Do I hold off until it's out of early access? Maybe? Maybe I'll spend some time with some of the other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a> on our list, not that I need anymore suffering in my gaming life right now. Cheers Elden Ring.</p>

			<p>Earlier today, a new CAPCOM Next event was <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1806137312830800334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by the Japanese publisher. The broadcast will go live on all main platforms (YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, Facebook) on Monday, July 1, 2024, at 3 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>The studio clarified a few things in advance: this CAPCOM Next broadcast will last around 25 minutes and will not include any news about <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-game-fest-impressions-surviving-the-dangerous-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. It will focus instead on three specific games: the newly unveiled Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard for iPhone/iPad/Mac.</p>
<p>The first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> yesterday with a surprise teaser. As shown in the pictures below, it is getting a substantial visual facelift. Other than that, we'll have to wait for the broadcast to learn more details about the remaster.</p>

<p>Due to launch on July 19 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X, it will be available for Game Pass subscribers on day one. The PC requirements can be found below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-layoffs-at-chinese-developer-perfect-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Thousands could be affected at the company's offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Chinese company Perfect World has reportedly laid off thousands of employees.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/perfect-world-cuts-staff-in-multi-unit-layoffs-reportedly-suspends-game-projects">Game Developer</a> (translating a report from Chinese publication <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27838848">The Paper</a>), the firm has made extensive cuts across its offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.</p>
<p>Most departments were reportedly impacted, apart from its esports segment.</p>
<p>Concerning its games currently in development, conflicting reports have emerged: The Paper said both One-Punch Man: World and Perfect New World are still being developed, while <a href="https://pandaily.com/perfect-world-lays-off-over-a-thousand-employees/">Pandaily</a> reported that they've been "suspended."</p>
<p>Perfect World is known for being a developer and publisher, as well as the exclusive distributor of Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 in China. It has a film production company as well.</p>
<p>Several publications have reported that it had recently experienced a sharp decline in revenue, as per its annual financial report, with net profit dropping 64% year-on-year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-acquires-perfect-world-entertainment-digic">Perfect World sold the publishing branch of its European subsidiary to Embracer in December 2021</a>, which was then <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/perfect-world-entertainment-rebrands-to-gearbox-publishing">renamed to Gearbox Publishing in April 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-embracer-layoffs-also-affect-gearbox-publishing">firm was hit by layoffs last year,</a> alongside many other Embracer studios, and its San Francisco office was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gearbox-publishing-is-now-arc-games">renamed again in April 2024, to Arc Games</a>.</p>

        <p>Developer set to unionise with the CWA, is the second ZeniMax studio to form a union</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Bethesda Game Studios Montreal has filed to unionise with the Communications Workers of America.</p>
<p>The BGS Montreal union announced yesterday in a thread on <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639">social media</a> that they filed for certification with the Quebec Labour Board.</p>
<p>"As a union, we will strive to make BGS a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent," it wrote. "This will allow us to keep creating some of the best video games in the industry in the jobs and studios we all love.</p>
<p>"Having a seat at the table will ensure job security as well as improve transparency, accountability, flexibility, and more. We aim to make sure everyone receives fair compensation for their work and the value they provide."</p>
<p>BGS Montreal is the second ZeniMax studio to unionise. In January 2023, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-qa-workers-form-union">ZeniMax QA workers formed ZeniMax Workers United</a>, with a majority of 300 employees across ZeniMax's US operations voting in favour of unionisation.</p>
<p>Last month, the CWA announced that all ZeniMax studio workers were covered by Microsoft's labour neutrality agreement, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">which both parties entered in 2022</a>, meaning the firm is legally bound to take a neutral stance on unionisation.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review.912804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When you name your controller after Doom’s most devastating weapon, you’re making a clear statement about just how powerful you think it is. With the Victrix Pro BFG, that initial statement is backed up by one of the most versatile and impressive controller packages in recent years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Victrix Pro BFG Wireless Controller" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Unhp5o8ALoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG is a wireless modular controller for PS5, PS4 and PC, our review unit decked out in PS5-centric white, with a proprietary USB dongle for connections. There’s also a black Xbox-flavoured version if that’s more your thing. Alongside the wireless option, there’s a 3-metre-long USB-C braided cable, to give the reassurance of a wired connection and reduce latency as much as possible, but that’s not all that you’ll find tucked away in the box.</p>


<p>This is where the Victrix Pro BFG’s package really starts to impress, and that’s before you’ve even tried playing a game with it. There’s a sturdy, hard-shell carry case, boasting the same white and purple colour scheme as the controller. Within it, there’s everything you could need to customise the Pro BFG to exactly how you like it, or exactly what a particular game needs.</p>
<p>This is a modular controller, much like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> series, and what that means is that you can swap around some of the components to suit your tastes. The left-hand module can be unscrewed – a nifty little screwdriver is included – so you can have either symmetrical or asymmetrical analogue sticks. If you’re a former Xbox player who now dabbles in the PlayStation side of things, you can at make your controller layout feel “right”, to go with the rather Xbox-like form it takes.</p>


<p>Alongside that, the right-hand module can be swapped out entirely, and there’s a fightpad – a six-button microswitch setup that ditches the analogue stick – that you can slot into place, and is ideal if you’re trying to perfect your combos in Street Fighter 6 or Tekken 8. Personally, this is a game-changer, and while it takes a few moments to swap, it’s well worth it for the huge advantage it’ll give you if you prefer playing fighting games with a pad rather than a stick. If you like an arcade stick, you should definitely check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/pdp-victrix-pro-fs-best-arcade-fight-stick-ps5-review/">Victrix’ own Pro FS stick</a>, incidentally.</p>
<p>While you’re swapping out or switching around your buttons, you can alter the analogue sticks themselves, and there’s a choice of a tall, hyper-accurate stick or a standard-length one with a PS3-style rounded head, alongside the two standard dimpled ones. There’s only one of these domed sticks, so you can’t completely mimic the old-school Dualshock 3, but it’s great to have this level of customisation. I found using the taller stick made my Overwatch 2 accuracy much greater, though it took some getting used to before I settled in.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there’s a choice of different gate types too, which are the sections that sit around the analogue stick. Current pads have circular gates, but octagonal gates can be really useful for some fighting games and other genres that would benefit from the more definite input – also N64 and GameCube emulators. It’s a shame that these aren’t using Hall Effect sensors, but Victrix are seemingly all set to release replacement Hall Effect modules in the coming months, and they are a step cheaper than some of their rivals.</p>
<p>You can also change the D-pad, and there’s a standard cross style, a circular version with a raised cross, and then Victrix’s own diamond-shaped offering. I’ve always preferred the old-school cross, but depending on what you’re playing you might want to swap it on a game-by-game basis. This is a pad that you can truly make your own, and while it can feel a little like Frankenstein’s monster – especially with the two analogue sticks changed out and a different gate in there – I genuinely can’t fault the options that Victrix have given us.</p>

<p>The Victrix Pro BFG weighs in at 271g – lighter than Victrix’ own claims – which is 13g lighter than the DualSense, and a whole 20g lighter than the standard Xbox Series X controller. There may be a few grams to be added with different sticks and gates, but our set up it was lighter and also better balanced than its standard rivals. This meant that even during the longest, sweatiest Overwatch 2 sessions – I do play other games, I promise – I never felt any fatigue thanks to my controller, just my occasionally terrible play.</p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG looks sleek and futuristic, but it’s also pleasingly understated. Its pure white plastic construction is interspersed with purple highlights, and large texturised grips sit comfortably beneath your palms, while a lighter texture wraps around each arm. It’s not shifting in your hands, that’s for certain, and thanks to a much improved battery life compared to the DualSense – up to 20 hours versus 8-12 – you won’t have to.</p>
<p>From there, it’s a bevy of inputs, and while you’ll find everything you’d expect on the face of the controller, there’s also a cavalcade of extra inputs and controls hidden away around the back. There’s a tiny platform selector, which is a little fiddly, but also small and precise enough that there’s no chance you’re going to catch it mid-game. You’ve then got four programmable buttons that nestle beneath your fingers, and I found these to be the most comfortable and well-placed rear buttons I’ve come across. They’re just right there, which… is kind of the point.</p>
<p>You can then control the range of each analogue trigger, and the spring-loaded selector is easy enough to figure out, holding them as you push the trigger as far as you want it to go, before then releasing them. Alternatively, you can set them with a hair-trigger so you barely have to press them – the perfect thing for lining up an instant headshot. I found that when I started using the controller, I kept undoing the settings for my triggers, somehow catching the release mechanism, but after a short amount of time, it just stopped happening. Thankfully.</p>

<p>If the level of customisation that Victrix have placed in your palms isn’t quite enough, they’ve gone even further with the Victrix Control Hub, a PC-based (or Xbox-based) app that lets you update the controller firmware, tinker with the stick and trigger deadzones, and choose from three different EQ settings for the wired audio connection. The biggest problem? The app isn’t on mobile or native to PlayStation itself, meaning that you’ll need a PC to finetune your experience. It’s a wrinkle in an otherwise flawless package.</p>
<p>There’s clearly some serious competition out there for pro controllers, and with the Victrix sitting around £170 it’s right in the centre of that conversation. It’s cheaper than the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">Dualsense Edge</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">Nacon Revolution 5 Pro</a>, and boasts wireless where the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> does not – we’re considering the Xbox variants, as Thrustmaster’s eSwap doesn’t have a PS5 native controller yet. It has more customisation options than all three, barring the Thrustmaster’s tiny driving wheel, and the only clear downsides are the lack of haptic rumble, and the inability to start your console up via the PlayStation button on the pad. Sony reserve such things for their own controllers, and that’s as frustrating here as it has been elsewhere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/defunct-xbox-cloud-console-keystone-shows-up-in-patent-filing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored 'Keystone' Xbox cloud console has been spotted <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Windows Central</a> in a patent filing <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/D1009161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> in the United States.&nbsp;The Xbox Keystone project was set aside over two years ago. At the time, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-device-keystone-needs-more-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have made the decision to pivot away from the current iteration of the Keystone device. We will take our learnings and refocus our efforts on a new approach that will allow us to deliver Xbox Cloud Gaming to more players around the world in the future.</em></p>
<p>A few months later, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-keystone-streaming-box-shelved-price-99-to-129-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to the subject</a>, revealing that the pricing was the main issue.</p>
<p><em>The console we built that now people have seen, Keystone, was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside.</em></p>
<p><em>With Keystone, we’re still focused on it and when can we get the right costs, but when you’ve got Series S at $299, and like during the holidays you’ll see some price promotion, you’ll obviously have Series X higher, I think in order for a streaming-only box to make sense, the price delta to S has to be pretty significant. I want to be able to include a controller in it when we go do that.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t want to announce pricing specifically, but I think you’ve got to be $129, $99, like somewhere in there for that to make sense in my view, that we just weren’t there. We weren’t there with the controller. And I love the effort. It worked really, really well.</em></p>
<p>It sounded like Spencer was really into the vision. Chances are Microsoft is still working on a way to lower costs to get the price where it needs to be, thus resurrecting Keystone (or a new version of it, anyway). Meanwhile, Xbox Cloud Gaming for owned games is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-for-owned-games-is-coming-this-year-says-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to launch later this year</a>, and last month, mouse and keyboard support was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-rolls-out-mouse-and-keyboard-support-for-26-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> for 26 games.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-clip-recording/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> around a month ago by the creator of SteamDB, Valve has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Steam Game Recording beta. It's a powerful set of tools that will allow users to record, replay, clip, and share footage from their games.</p>
<div>
<p><em><strong>RECORD - Never miss a moment</strong></em></p>
<p><em>With Background Recording mode, your gameplay is continuously saved to your preferred drive, never exceeding your specified duration and storage limits. An&nbsp; On-Demand Recording mode with manual start and stop is also available. Use the&nbsp; Steam Timeline and&nbsp; Event Markers to find key moments.</em></p>
</div>

<p><strong><em>REPLAY - Quickly jump back in time</em></strong></p>
<div>
<p><em>Useful for things like seeing what went wrong when your hero died or recalling something mentioned by an NPC earlier. Accessible in the Steam Overlay for every game.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>CLIP - Find and keep the good stuff</em></strong><br>
<em>Keep only the video that matters to you. Steam offers lightweight tools to make it easy to find and clip your gameplay footage. Share and edit local footage in the redesigned Recordings &amp; Screenshots interface.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>SHARE - Conveniently send clips</em></strong><br>
<em>Get your videos where you want them. One-click share to a friend in chat or post your finest moments for the world to see. Plus, easily send footage from your Steam Deck to your PC or mobile device. Use the new Save/Share menu during or after play.</em></p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-1527268-1" width="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4">https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>Valve also explained that the Steam Timeline appears whenever you’re actively recording. Timeline-enhanced games generate event markers as relevant game events happen, though for the Steam Game Recording Beta, only Valve's own Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 are supported. That said, developers will be able to leverage <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/timeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an SDK and API</a> to implement the feature. Steam achievements and screenshots automatically create markers, and players can create their own markers, too.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Steam Game Recording, unlike NVIDIA's Shadowplay, does not offer the option to record the desktop or other programs. That said, you may include audio from other programs, such as Discord. To join the beta, you must go to Steam, Settings, Interface, Beta Participation, and select one of the two available options. Then, you'll need to go to Settings, Game Recording, and pick either Background or On-Demand Recording.</p>
<p>You'll find your recordings in the folders in View &gt; Recordings &amp; Screenshots when using the Steam desktop client. From your Steam Deck, select the Media tab from the main menu. Keep in mind that you can choose where your recordings are stored on your hard drive from Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Game Recording.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Steam Game Recording feature takes advantage of NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards to minimize the performance hit when recording. However, Intel users are seemingly out of luck, as Valve said systems without NVIDIA/AMD GPUs would have to fall back to the CPU, causing a much larger performance hit.</p>

			<p>Capcom has rolled out a new Dragon's Dogma 2 update across all platforms, adding new graphical modes on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new patch</a> for the hit title is available now and, aside from the above-mentioned new graphical modes on consoles, it includes adjustments and additions to the storage as well as plenty of fixes. On PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, this new update also comes with a new 120Hz option, which can either be en- or disabled. In addition, the patch aims to address issues around CPU overload on certain occasions. We highly suggest reading the <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full release notes here</a>. We've included a photo of the notes down below as well:</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dragon_s-dogma-2-update.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.&nbsp; The game was released back in March of this year, and as covered last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-3-million-units-sold-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3 million copies of the game have been sold since launch</a>. Here's what we wrote about the long-overdue sequel to 2012's Dragon's Dogma in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a>:</p>
<p><em>"The most unlikely locations may hide the greatest treasures, rewarding players after a long and arduous trip. While this is no Soulslike game (which is a massive bonus in my book), the relatively limited fast travel means you'll often have to brave the roads for a long while to reach your objective. Also, the more you fight monsters, the more you accumulate the so-called loss gauge. This meter progressively reduces the maximum health you can recover with consumables or magic abilities, and it can only be restored while resting at an inn or campsite. The latter will be your only option for resting in the wilderness, provided there is a nearby campsite to begin with. If not, you'll be forced to go ahead and deal with the reduced health as best as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>The other major strength of Dragon's Dogma 2 lies, once again like its predecessor, with the combat system. First and foremost, it feels great and extremely fun to play, thanks to a praise-worthy combination of animation, sound, and spell effects. The abilities of each Vocation also provide an excellent sense of class identity, allowing for many different playstyles."</em></p>
