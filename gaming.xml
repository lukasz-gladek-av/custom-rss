			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is just a couple of weeks away from launching. Fans are counting the hours down to return to the namesake town from Maine, United States, and today, we've got an unexpected treasure trove of new footage to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>The source is Spanish content creator MenosTrece, who <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2256710796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streamed</a> several hours of gameplay from the PC review build of the Silent Hill 2 remake on Twitch. Needless to say, unless he got special permission from KONAMI, the live stream violated the embargo and thus will be taken down as soon as possible by the publisher (and the content creator might face legal trouble, too). As such, if you're eager to check out the footage, watch it right away rather than waiting until a later time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the video quality is not so great, not even reaching the Full HD option. Still, we've embedded it below in case you want to watch it.</p>

<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was developed by Bloober Team, is powered by Unreal Engine 5, and will launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on October 8. Just recently, the latest trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-wont-be-available-on-other-consoles-until-10-08-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the game won't be available on other platforms (mainly Xbox consoles) until at least October 10, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>God of War Ragnarök is now facing "review bombing" on Steam, following Sony's requirement that PC users connect to a PSN account, in a repeat of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-steam-reviews-crash-following-news-of-mandatory-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2 review bombing</a> for the same reason. Sony eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverted</a> the mandatory PSN account, but that was only because, at launch, it hadn't been the case, and people were pissed they could no longer play the game they had purchased.</p>
<p>The PC port of God of War Ragnarök was a highly awaited title among fans, mainly due to the original hype built by the console release, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a perfect score on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>God of War Ragnarok is exactly what we hoped for, and even more. It offers a masterfully told story using a more mature approach, seasoned with a unique setting, a rich characterization of the characters, and challenges that can keep even hardcore gamers busy at the highest difficulties. In other words, it is a title that is simply just too good to be missed.</em></p>
<p>The game finally debuted on the PC platform this week, nearly two years after its PS5 launch. As mentioned above, it became a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/negativereviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">victim of review bombing</a> by Steam fans, who are disappointed by the requirement to link a PSN account to play the game. Fans say that the whole "identification" process is a complete disaster, especially when it comes to submitting documents and government-issued IDs.</p>
<p>Here is how a user has expressed his sentiments against the decision, backed by the fact that such a decision puts user data at risk and can potentially lead to identity theft.</p>
<p><em>There is NO reason a single player offline experience should require any third-party login—especially a PSN account on a PC platform. This provides no benefit to the customer and only worsens the overall experience, adding unnecessary security risks on top of being an inconvenience to the user and not even allowing people in certain countries to have access to it.</em></p>
<p>This isn't the only reason the God of War Ragnarök has negative reviews. Other users claim that the game is filled with bugs, including crashes due to "lack of VRAM" along with lower frame rates (despite the presence of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-to-boost-performance-in-god-of-war-ragnarok-final-fantasy-xvi-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-and-enotria-the-last-song/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 3</a>) and bad optimization. So, while several positive reviews are appreciating the port, it looks like most of them are commenting on the game's questionable state on PC. The port was handled by Jetpack Interactive, which also worked on bringing the previous installment to PC and will surely attempt to improve the optimization issues through patches.&nbsp;The PSN account problem, however, rests entirely in Sony's hands.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stardew Valley’s 1.6 Update is Coming to Console and Mobile on November 4]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-6-update-console-mobile/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stardew-valley%E2%80%99s-1-6-update-is-coming-to-console-and-mobile-on-november-4.988596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-6-update-console-mobile/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Stardew Valley’s developer, ConcernedApe, has confirmed that the long-awaited 1.6 update is arriving on console and mobile platforms on November 4. Back in March 2024, 1.6 was deployed on PC, adding a string of updates to the game that console and mobile players have been patiently awaiting for these past few months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-1-6">What’s in 1.6?</h2>



<p>Stardew Valley’s 1.6 update added a bunch of new content to the game.</p>



<p>The core features of the update revolved around new festivals and events, as well as a mastery system and a new farm type. This is the ‘Meadowlands Farm’ that proved to be a favourite with fans shortly after it was added to the game.</p>



<p>ConcernedApe expanded NPC dialogue, incorporating new gift reactions, and patching up missing dialogue that had been presenting an issue for quite some time.</p>



<p>Pets were also added, and they were given the ability to love their owner based on gifts received.</p>



<p>Per the seasonal rotation of the game, NPCs were given ‘winter outfits’ to keep them on theme.</p>



<p>These updates all came in side-by-side with stacks of new items, renovation options, crops, fish, and interactions with the environment. It was one of the biggest updates in Stardew Valley history, and it’s not long until console and mobile players can get their hands on it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Release date for Stardew Valley console &amp; mobile 1.6 update: November 4th</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1837953798289199323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Stardew continues to be one of the world’s most popular ‘cosy’ games, with some content creators having based their entire persona around this one game. It’s constantly sitting high in the charts on gaming and streaming platforms worldwide, and it remains a wonder that it was all pieced together by a single developer.</p>



<p>ConcernedApe confirmed that on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, the 1.6 update will be deployed on November 4. It’s better late than never, right?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls Online Has Made $15 Million a Month For 10 Years, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-15m-a-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-online-has-made-15-million-a-month-for-10-years-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.988593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-15m-a-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been suggested that The Elder Scrolls Online, which was released in 2014, has made $15 million every month since it launched. This claim goes hand-in-hand with a report that ‘ESO’, which is maintained by ZeniMax Online Studios, has raked in a whopping $2 billion since 2014.</p>



<p>Elder Scrolls Online is one of the most popular MMORPGs ever made. It allows players to explore the many realms that makeup Tamriel, the fictional setting of The Elder Scrolls universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-septims-is-that">How Many Septims Is That?</h2>



<p>The ‘$15 million a month’ reference was dug up <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1836976910628159719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Timur222 on Twitter</a>, who found the number on the profile of Gary Boodhoo, a former UX lead at ZeniMax Online Studios.</p>



<p>I’ve mentioned that this is a ‘claim’ because Boodhoo’s profile suggests he departed from ZeniMax Online Studios in 2016, just two years after The Elder Scrolls Online was released. On his profile, he writes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Interaction design and Information architecture for itemization of digital assets, working alongside Content and Business teams to drive $15M in monthly revenue for over 10 years.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s possible he’s still plugged into the ecosystem and just <strong>knows </strong>that’s how much the game has continued to make since being released a decade ago. He works now in a consultancy capacity but insists he’s still connected to The Elder Scrolls.</p>



<p>The Elder Scrolls Online is one of ZeniMax’s most successful games ever, and since being released ten years ago, it has succeeded at pulling in and holding the attention of millions of gamers worldwide. It’s still receiving sizeable expansions today, and with there still being more ground to cover across the game’s universe, it’ll likely remain online for several years to come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-player-count-has-reached-a-new-all-time-high-record.988590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-player-count-new-all-time-high/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Steam continues to pull in millions of gamers, firming up its position as the premier digital storefront on PC. Hours ago, the platform hit a new all-time high player count record, with 38,367,277 users being active on the platform concurrently. Steam’s popularity is increasing exponentially – in 2020, peaks were sitting at around 18 million users.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-lot-of-gaming">That’s a Lot of Gaming</h2>



<p>Out of those 38 million users, around 12 million were actively playing a game when the new record was secured. In recent weeks, <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=24h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a few titles</a> have contributed massively to this growth on the platform.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ve got Counter-Strike 2, which remains Valve’s most-played game ever, sitting with a 24-hour peak of 1,459,492 players. Behind that ranks games like PUBG (787,340 peak), Dota 2 (731,193 peak), Black Myth: Wukong (533,128 peak), and Naraka: Bladepoint (298,908 peak).</p>



<p>In fifth place rests ‘Banana’, the strange, money-printing game that stormed up the charts earlier this year when users found they could potentially make hundreds of dollars simply by clicking a banana. It has been permeated by bot activity so that the active player count is inflated.</p>



<p>For shame.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, more games than ever are being played on Steam – and more are being <strong>released</strong>. </p>



<p>By way of a comparison, I’ll point out that in 2020, 9,699 gamers were released on Steam. In 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that number hit 14,422</a>, another all-time high for the platform. In 2006 – which is as far back as records go – just 71 games were released on Steam. From the single-dev indie games to the AAA titles, everything is finding a home on Steam.</p>



<p>In January 2024, it was estimated that more than 73,000 unique games were available on Steam, and that’s without mentioning the scores of DLC, expansions, and additional content. It is single-handedly holding up the bulk of the PC-based gaming market on its shoulders, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it surpasses 40 million concurrent users very soon.</p>

<p>Riot Games has confirmed that Linkin Park’s new track, Heavy is the Crown, is this year’s League of Legends World Championship anthem. This was all but known in recent weeks when several clues surfaced online pointing to the track – one of the first new songs from the group in several years – being this year’s LoL Worlds anthem.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-year-another-banger">Another Year, Another Banger</h2>



<p>The League of Legends Worlds anthem is typically a profile track that garners hundreds of millions of listens online. In recent years, some of the biggest artists in the world have lent their talents and profile to the League of Legends World Championship. Most recently, NewJeans provided the anthem.</p>



<p>Heavy is the Crown is one of Linkin Park’s newest tracks, taken from the group’s first new album in years – ‘From Zero’.</p>



<p>Recently, Linkin Park revealed a new lead singer in the form of Emily Armstrong, who has stepped in to provide vocal talents following the tragic passing of Chester Bennington in 2017.</p>



<p>Heavy is the Crown, which is expected to be one of the best LoL Worlds anthems in years, will premiere on YouTube tomorrow, September 24:</p>

<p>This year’s Championship will unravel in the O2 Arena in London, England. Between September 25 and November 2, the world’s greatest League of Legends teams will descend on the venue seeking their chance at winning the $445,000 grand prize. It’s one of the biggest events in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-events-calendar-2024/">the esports calendar</a>, and last year’s event broke global viewership records.</p>



<p>League of Legends remains one of the ‘Big Three’ esports titles, sitting at the top of the table alongside Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. It’s a monumental title that continues to spearhead the growth of the industry, and the League of Legends World Championship 2024 shouldn’t be missed, even if you’re not a huge fan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-30th-anniversary-prices/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A leaker has revealed some of the prices for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pre-order-playstation-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 30th anniversary collection</a>, which includes the limited edition PS5 slim and DualSense controller.</p>



<p>The information comes from reputable dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-les-prix-de-quelques-references-des-editions-limitees-du-30eme-anniversaire-playstation-59567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> (via dealabs), who has revealed the prices for the PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) console bundle and the DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller. According to the leaker, the prices are as follows:</p>



<p><strong>PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) console bundle</strong> – <strong>$499.99 USD</strong> (rumored to cost €519.99 and £449.99)<br><strong>DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller</strong> – <strong>$79.99 USD</strong> (rumored to cost €79.99 and £69.99)</p>



<p>As rightfully pointed out by the community, the prices don’t appear to be as high as expected and while this information is nearly leaks at this stage and should be taken with a pinch of salt, the leaker does obtain his information from the backend of website stores, so it’s almost certain accurate.</p>



<p>While the dataminer couldn’t find any information on the other limited edition items, including the hotly anticipated PS5 Pro console bundle and PlayStation Portal, the prices of the two items suggest that they won’t be as high as people were hoping. However, it should be stressed that the 30th anniversary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro</a> console bundle, which will include a PlayStation 5 Pro (already retails for $699), DualSense&nbsp;Edge wireless controller, and more will almost certainly be over the $1000. Hopefully, us UK and European folk won’t get burned to hard on the conversation rates there (wishful thinking, I know).</p>



<p>What do you think of the prices so far on the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Edition PlayStation 5 and wireless controller? Did you expect them to be higher? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-preview-a-delicious-delight.988404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview-delicious-delight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frolicking through the Shire used to be a dream, but <em>Tales of the Shire</em> brings those dreams to reality. With an adorable art style, a world that feels alive, and excellent cooking mechanics, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is shaping up to be everything cozy <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fans were hoping for.</p>
<p>I was able to preview <em>Tales of the Shire</em> for 90 minutes earlier this week, and it was better than I could’ve hoped. The story follows a Hobbit moving from Bree to the Shire. Some Hobbits aren’t big on change, and the player will need to win everyone over and help build the Shire up. And what better way to get Hobbits to warm up to someone than by sharing a meal?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-gandalf.jpg?itok=I4wR2XeP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-gandalf.jpg?itok=OhczKYdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The introduction in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is everything a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>fan could want.</figcaption></figure><p>There are a ton of things to do, like farming, foraging, helping other Hobbits, and – of course – cooking. Cooking and sharing meals is a staple in the life of a Hobbit (after all, who can forget about Second Breakfast).&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=-90uNJz9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=LhvXt9du 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cooking isn't as simple as it is in most other games.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cooking is actually fun in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>Preview</h2>
<p>Preparing meals has a few different components to it that make it complex enough to keep your attention. Texture plays a big part in meals, along with flavor, just like in real life. Players have to choose the best ingredients possible while also cutting and cooking things just right to get the best texture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was much more interactive than I was expecting, and it fit perfectly in for a game centered around cooking. The act of sharing meals was also more complex – the Hobbits all have specific things they like, and it’s not as easy to figure out as most would expect.</p>
<p>Everything centered around the home was incredible, including home design. I enjoy decorating in games, but it generally feels a bit stiff. However, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> had a delightful decorating system, and the decorations were so cute that I spent a bit too much time in it for the 90-minute preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t regret it, though – between the cooking and home decorations, it’s my definition of cozy to the max.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hobson-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=6PChEK1x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hobson-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=AOpcs2Re 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hobbits in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>are full of life and expression.​​​​​</figcaption></figure><h2>The other great things to do in <em>Tales of the Shire</em></h2>
<p>That doesn’t mean that you want to spend all your time inside. Between exploring, helping other Hobbits, fishing, and collecting ingredients, there’s not a lack of things to do outside the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is gorgeous. When the first looks at <em>Tales of the Shire</em> were released, people were skeptical about the art style. However, it works beautifully in-game. The world is dazzling, and little details are scattered everywhere that make it feel full of life. What better way to represent the Shire?</p>
<p>The music is also what you’d expect in a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game. The soundtrack was calming and charming, and it matched the vibes of the Shire perfectly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bridge-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=o0J_oomZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bridge-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=j3Twh82n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Shire is so full of beautiful details.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tales of the Shire</em> had a few small problems</h2>
<p>There were a few bumps in terms of gameplay. The guiding system is really clever and uses birds to help guide players to objectives. However, it never seemed to work right. Birds would appear after I’d go down the correct path, so they weren’t really helpful for leading. There was also a moment when the game just stopped working.</p>
<p>However, the game is six months away from release. I’d be amazed if I ran into no hiccups in 90 minutes of playtime.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>All in all, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is one of 2025’s most anticipated cozy games</h2>
<p>The first 90 minutes of <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is more than I could’ve dared hope for. The small issues I encountered didn’t drag the game down. I’m very excited to see how the game continues to improve, and how it progresses in terms of complexity when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-the-shire-delayed">releases early next year</a>.</p>

                <p>The first time I watched Lord of the Rings, I wanted nothing more than to be a gorgeous, willowy, and effortlessly cool elf who was, as nearly all eight year-old girls desired, married to Orlando Bloom's Legolas. In my late teens, I grew content with remaining human so long as I got the chance to swoon over Aragon. But now, at the wise age of almost-31, I know the truth: The greatest being that you could ever hope to be in Middle-earth is a hobbit. Fortunately, Tales of the Shire lets you do just that.</p><p dir="ltr">Wētā Workshop's Tales of Shire is a cozy life-simulation game that revolves around Tolkien's coziest creatures, hobbits. Considering the high-demand for wholesome titles and the enduring love for the Lord of the Rings series, I always felt it was simply a matter of time until a game celebrating these jovial and endlessly hungry creatures was developed. After all, what do hobbits do but tend to their land, drink, dance, be merry, and, occasionally, set off on an epic quest to save the world? I recently had the chance to do almost all these things while playing a two hour preview build of Tales of the Shire, but unfortunately, I didn't walk away from the experience as content as a Gamgee snug in their hobbit-hole. While Tales of the Shire is charming and has some good fundamentals, Wētā Workshop will need to embark on a journey filled with several quality-of-life improvements and a few major overhauls if it wants to make this game something special.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tales Of The Shire Hands-On: Concerned About Hobbits</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The preview follows your created character leaving their hometown of Bree to start a life of their own in one of The Shire's quaintest villages, Bywater. When you get there, however, your first series of quests involves proving that Bywater actually <em>is </em>a village, as a local curmudgeon implies the village is more "Backwater" than Bywater.</p><p dir="ltr">This storyline serves as a sort of tutorial for the game, as it introduces you to some of your neighbors and the game's core features: fishing, cooking, gardening, foraging, and nurturing relationships. Many of these features really worked for me. The game's fishing mechanic, while not novel, is a fun, tension-based mini-game that avoids being annoying or grueling. Despite not being someone especially fond of in-game cooking or crafting--generally I do those things out of necessity--I actually found myself wanting to spend a significant amount of time in my kitchen. Rather than just hitting a few buttons to make a meal, you are encouraged to chop and cook your ingredients to create a more textured dish.</p><p dir="ltr">This ties in with gardening and foraging, as high-quality ingredients, spices, and herbs help elevate the meal's overall flavor. I adored mindlessly wandering through the woods, picking up hops, puffball mushrooms, and currants. Another system I really enjoyed in Tales of the Shire is Companion Crops, which gives certain crops bonuses if they are grown next to a crop it gets along with. Conversely, there are some crops that should be kept in different beds, lest their quality decline. After harvesting, collecting, and fishing up ingredients, it was easy to throw 'em all into my massive pantry that you can seamlessly pull from while cooking. In short, the more "free-form" elements of Tales of the Shire work together splendidly.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the "nurturing relationships" aspect is a different story. Though one of the ways you can improve your relationships--inviting your neighbors over for a dinner party that will satiate their cravings--is fun, that is unfortunately about the extent of what I enjoyed. While I liked the game's writing overall, many of the town's villagers felt same-y to me, each offering the same cheeky banter and, more gratingly, frustrating fetch quests. So much of my time in the village was spent going back and forth between a select few hobbits, with a particularly egregious quest seeing me going back and forth between the same two hobbits upwards of four times.</p><p dir="ltr">And while the overall environment is lovely and evocative of The Shire we know and love--quaint, comforting, and verdant--I found myself continuously irked by the game's quirks. Bywater is filled with hobbits, a clear effort to make the town feel lived-in that I understand completely. But it quickly grew frustrating when I was trying to walk around and meet my neighbors and just about <em>every</em> hobbit I bumped into was an NPC whom I could not interact with. Despite being filled with people, it began to feel a bit scarce.</p><p dir="ltr">In lieu of a traditional mini-map, compass, or some other form of "breadcrumb trail" to follow, Tales of the Shire chooses to immerse players by having them follow blue birds that will perch themselves atop fence posts and signs every so often. While cute in theory, it would often get a bit frustrating when I was going faster than the birds would appear, or when I was traversing through a denser area--such as the town square or woods--and would simply lose track of them. Considering Bywater is so deeply embedded in nature and filled with small bridges, winding roads, and only a couple handfuls of NPCs you can interact with, scattered about the map, not being able to fully rely on the birds was frustrating. Despite the game clearly not wanting you to be constantly pulling up your map and losing that sense of whimsical adventure, I felt like I had to. And these are just a couple of my gripes.</p><p dir="ltr">Between the fetch quests, my growing frustrations with certain features, and the lack of compelling characters or plot points, I eventually found myself not particularly interested in leaving my little hobbit-hole. However, unlike a game like Stardew Valley in which being fairly reclusive and focusing on creating your own little slice of paradise is viable, Tales of the Shire seems reliant upon you interacting with your neighbors. Partly because you'd be hard pressed to actually fill your entire day doing all the truly fun things, even if you do decide to spend a chunk of time giving your home a fun little makeover.</p><p>This then relegates you to doing quests that are not particularly unengaging for neighbors who are not particularly engaging. It's also worth pointing out that, at least in the preview, there was no calendar filled with birthdays, festivals, or any other events. This gave me pause, as without something to break up the mundane aspects of the game, I am not sure that I would be compelled to keep playing. Ultimately, that is the biggest issue with Tales of the Shire right now: Even a life sim sicko like me (don't ask how many hours I've put into Moonstone Island and Fields of Mistria this year) doesn't feel pulled in by this game. Though it has some great features, lovely music, an art style that, while a bit clunky, feels suiting and adds a great deal of charm, <em>and</em> an incredible IP behind it, the whole package offered doesn't quite work. Fortunately, the game was delayed out of 2024 and will instead be released in early 2025, hopefully giving the team a bit of time to polish the game into something Gollum would covet.</p>

Compared to our first test build, the current Tokyo Game Show demo features more optimized character models, including better facial details and color schemes. These tweaks allow characters to show more dynamic facial expressions, which helps bring out their personalities and make them feel more alive—closer to their original designs.</p><p>“We’ve also optimized models, textures, and lighting for environments, which greatly improves the overall visual presentation and immersion of the game world. We’ve enhanced character ultimate skills and weapon attack effects as well, making ultimates look more powerful while shortening the cutscenes to avoid interrupting combat flow. Weapon hits also feel more responsive now, and the visuals make attacks look more powerful. These adjustments make the combat feel even cooler.</p><p>“There’s a lot more in the pipeline that we couldn’t show today. But we’ll be revealing updates in the official DNA community.

<p>Over the weekend, hours-long streams of <em>both</em> games are popping up online, most of which have been chopped up into small, social media-friendly pieces and shared to sites like X/Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok, often without spoiler warnings.</p>

<p>It's unclear how the streamers acquired their copies, or if the early streams will remain live and online, but at the time of writing, there are many, <em>many</em> clips of both games making the rounds.</p>
<p>If you are hoping to go into either game without any prior knowledge, now may be a good time to start that social media detox or, at the very least, update your list of muted/banned words…</p>
<p>For anyone who missed the news, it's finally been confirmed that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">Silent Hill 2 Remake will be exclusive to PlayStation 5 for one year</a>.</p>

These games have allowed players to import their choices from previous entries in order to keep a consistent world state that feels shaped, to some degree, by your actions.

Still, for all its apparent concern with making players feel like their decisions have lasting impact, BioWare’s track record is arguably a bit spotty in this regard, and at times the studio has outright undone the effects of major choices players have made. At a preview event earlier this month John Epler, creative director on <em>the Veilguard</em>, talked a bit about the studio’s philosophy for handling these decisions. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*1gwgbb5*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjkxNjk4Mi45OC4xLjE3MjY5MjQzMDQuNTkuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*1gwgbb5*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjkxNjk4Mi45OC4xLjE3MjY5MjQzMDQuNTkuMC4w">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-recommend-id="image://e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1501" data-height="845" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-recommend-id="image://e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1501" data-height="845" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you boot up BioWare’s long-awaited RPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> on October 31 and create your custom character, you’ll be asked what Faction your protagonist Rook came from before the game starts.

Here are the three major <em>Dragon Age</em> extended universe projects BioWare says you may want to catch up on before <em>The Veilguard</em>. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-books-comics-missing-audio-drama-1851649328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-books-comics-missing-audio-drama-1851649328">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-recommend-id="image://18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-recommend-id="image://18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Earlier this month, myself and several other content creators and members of the press got to go hands-on with BioWare’s long-anticipated RPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span>. I came away from my seven hours with it really impressed with what feels like the most cohesive game BioWare has put together since probably 2012’s <em>Mass Effect 3</em>.

            <p>New details about Assassin's Creed Invictus have leaked online.</p>
<p>According to X/Twitter user j0nathan - a leaker with extraordinarily good prior form for Assassin's Creed information - Invictus will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>' inspired multiplayer game in which players will assume the avatars of different Assassin's Creed characters and fight to get through each round.</p>

<p>"It will be a sort of 'Fall Guys' – 16 players (for the moment) who compete over several rounds with different 'games'," j0nathan wrote, as translated by Google and what's left of my French GCSE.</p> <div>

<p>"Among the game [types], we find Team Deathmatch, another free-for-all, and a speed game where you have to go to light points scattered on the map. If you qualify for the next round, you can choose types of powers to form a build in the final game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, j0nathan belives they can "confirm" two characters - Ezio and Cesare Borgia - and says the gameplay will be "arcade" like in nature, "with hits without real impact and even a 'bubble' shield like in Smash Bros".</p>
<p>Maps will be inspired from Assassin's Creed games, such as Mirage's Baghdad, Shadows' Japan, "a map in a paradise island" likely inspired by Black Flag. There's also a map based on Pompeii, complete "with rising lava".</p>
<p>Without formal confirmation from Ubisoft either way, all we can do is take this as a rumour for now, but even the moderation team on the subreddit admits Jonathan has been "somewhat accurate" with prior Assassin's Creed-flavoured leaks.</p>
<p>"We don't know how much or little is true of it so maybe don't come to conclusions?" the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fmbohk/comment/lo9e5xi/">moderator</a> cautioned. "Sure Jonathan has leaked in the past that has been at least somewhat accurate. But this info could be old or incomplete. Or just not true."</p>
<p>In June, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot condemned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">"the malicious and personal online attacks" directed at the game's developers</a> after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' initial reveal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">Assassin's Creed franchise head Marc-Alexis Côté recently spoken about having to take "a step back"</a> rather than respond to criticism of the game on social media from X owner Elon Musk.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
