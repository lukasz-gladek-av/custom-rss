			<p>Less than a day following the PC launch of Final Fantasy XVI, modders have already come up with a so-called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FFXVI Fix mod</a> that improves some key shortcomings, such as:</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the 30FPS cap in cutscenes/photo mode.</li>
<li>Adjust gameplay FOV.</li>
<li>Allow frame generation in cutscenes.</li>
<li>JXL screenshot quality option and fixes hitching while taking screenshots.</li>
<li>Allow the use of motion blur + frame generation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ultrawide/narrower</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove pillarboxing/letterboxing in borderless/fullscreen.</li>
<li>Fixed HUD scaling with configurable HUD size.</li>
<li>Fixed FOV scaling at &lt;16:9.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install the FFXVI Fix mod, download the file from Nexus (or <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FFXVIFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>) and extract the zipped file's contents to the main game folder. To adjust settings, tweak the FFXVIIFix.ini file. The mod also works on Linux/Steam Deck. In this case, open up the game properties in Steam and add "WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b" %command%" to the launch options.</p>
<p>This isn't the only mod available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus</a> for Final Fantasy XVI. Other useful options include a mod to toggle UI and/or HUD on and off (with two presets of visibility), a mod that increases the item limit on all standard items to 9 (higher values prevent the game from booting, apparently), and a couple of ReShade presets that changes the colors.</p>
<p>Many more mods will undoubtedly follow, and Producer Naoki Yoshida is <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-asks-pc-users-to-not-go-too-far-with-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossing</a> his fingers that they won't be offensive or inappropriate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Help Small Creators Grow With YouTube’s New ‘Hype’ Feature]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-hype-new-creator-feature/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/help-small-creators-grow-with-youtube%E2%80%99s-new-%E2%80%98hype%E2%80%99-feature.984681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-hype-new-creator-feature/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>YouTube has unveiled ‘Hype’, an all-new mechanic designed to promote small streamers and creators and allow their communities to boost them up and better their discoverability. Per a recent release, Hype will ‘give fans a stake in the success of their favourite emerging creators’.</p>



<p>From the ground up, Hype has been created to help streamers with under 500,000 subscribers get ‘seen’ on YouTube.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-does-hype-work">How Does Hype Work?</h2>



<p>YouTube’s ‘Hype’ feature is pretty simple.</p>



<p>If you’re following a small creator (&lt;500,000 subscribers) and they publish a new video, you’ll be able to ‘hype’ that video and push them up a virtual leaderboard. The more hype a video receives, the further up the leaderboard it’ll rank, and if a streamer or content creator ranks high enough, they’ll secure special badges on their videos.</p>



<p>Users will have three ‘hypes’ to use per week, so you’ll have to vote sparingly on which videos you want to boost.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post</a> discussing Hype, YouTube wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Hype, we hope to make the viewing experience more active and engaging, driven by shared purpose and enthusiasm. That not only makes hyping more engaging for viewers but also gives creators a powerful new way to connect with their audiences and grow their channels.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a neat new feature if it couldn’t be monetised. To that end, YouTube will allow viewers to ‘purchase additional hypes’ — but the team stressed that this will unlock another revenue stream for creators and not necessarily the platform, so that could be a huge win.</p>



<p>It was revealed that in test countries, users hyped up 50,000 channels with more than five million unique hype votes. </p>



<p>The team hasn’t confirmed when the feature will roll out globally, but we can expect Hype to land in new markets soon enough.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a solid feature for boosting small streamers, or will it likely end up being abused? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon, reportedly will cost $40 and the game is too far along in development to pivot to a free-to-play model.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-marathon-details-on-heroes-price-and-radio-silence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, Helldivers 2's $40 price point and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">monumental success</a> cemented the premium-cost idea for Marathon.

Barring any sort of catastrophe, Marathon won't be launching with a free-to-play model. The game will also reportedly have a standard cosmetic and battle-pass system in addition to the upfront $40 cost.</p>

<p>There will also reportedly be no substantial updates about Marathon until Spring 2025, although game director Joe Ziegler might reveal some information to clear up leaks and rumors, such as a potential class or hero system. When Ziegler replaced <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">former director Christopher Barrett</a>, the hero concept reportedly was brought more to the forefront.

            <p>
Amid ongoing player complaints and claims Ubisoft's free-to-play shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> is underperforming, the publisher has insisted the game is "absolutely not dying" as it unveils plans to tackle a range of issues in an updated development roadmap.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft shared XDefiant's latest roadmap in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG">newly published blog post</a>, starting with an update on the game's netcode and hitreg issues, and admitting it "still [has] a ways to go" as far as improvements are concerned. "I just want to quickly address the status of the game. i.e. is the game dying?," the author then wrote. "No, the game is absolutely not dying. We know there are things we need to improve like Netcode/Hitreg and adding more content to progression, but the game is doing well. We just want it to do better. And we do that by addressing the concerns of our community which has always been the plan."
</p>
<p>
The post continued, "Ubisoft is very much behind us and has allocated more resources to the team in order for us to do that." To that end, the accompanying roadmap promises "a lot of new content and features" for XDefiant's first year, ending in its "biggest ever event".

<p>
According to Ubisoft's roadmap, Seasons 2, 3, and 4 will all feature a new faction, three new weapons, three new maps, and new limited time modes, with more specific inclusions - such as the arrival of Bots mode, Bomb! mode, and private matches - also mentioned. Additionally, there's talk of numerous planned improvements, including battle pass progression speed changes, plus mantle, player collision, footstep audio improvements - which come alongside ongoing work on netcode and hitreg.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's update follows a slump in its share price that's been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/game-developer-ubisoft-slides-amid-muted-reception-star-wars-outlaws-2024-09-03/">partially attributed</a> to lower-than-expected interest in XDefiant, and comes after player claims the shooter was "rushed out". Responding to the latter suggestion back in July, XDefiant producer Mark Rubin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/defiantx-producer-says-players-should-stick-around-but-admits-right-now-theres-a-lot-of-bugs">insisted</a> that wasn't the case - instead blaming teething troubles on a game engine "that was designed for something else", and admitting to "a lot of bugs".

<p>
"We're not a shooter that's been out for 20 years," continued Rubin. "If you like what we are trying to do stick around and you'll see things improve and new features get added. But if the game isn't for you that's ok you can move on."

			<p>The concept of a dedicated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-jackbox-naughty-pack">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a> is an interesting one, not least because I’m pretty sure that most people play Jackbox games with a bunch of dirty jokes and swear words anyway. At least in the groups I play with, while we might start clean, everything eventually descends into naming anatomical parts of human bodies in as crude a manner as possible, and then most people giggling like school children who’ve just learned their first naughty word.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Naughty Pack | Official Trailer (ESRB) | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAYOPKYDuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Jackbox Naughty Pack includes three games, which you’ll note is notably fewer the five games that are typically featured in a bundle. Each of these has been designed to bring out the rudest and most adult themes and jokes going. Wait, no, that’s not quite right. Two of these are actually older games, albeit good ones, with more adult prompts, and one is a brand-new game that doesn’t quite land. I adore these Party Packs, so it pains me to say that this one just doesn’t hit right.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the golden oldies. Fakin’ It All Night Long is a dirty version of Fakin’ It, where you have to lie a lot and try not to get caught out. It’s still a great game , but it feels like a really weak inclusion here because, well, we’re all adults anyway, so most Jackbox games of Fakin’ it would end up with some R-rated undertones anyway.</p>

<p>The same is then true of Dirty Drawful. Drawful is an all-time classic of a game, the unusual prompts leading to even more unusual drawings, and the inevitably unusual titles that people come up with for them. We’ve seen Jackbox revisit the idea a couple times, with the standalone Drawful 2 and then Drawful Animate in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/the-jackbox-party-pack-8-review-job-job-drawful-weapons-drawn-best-games/">Party Pack 8</a>, and so Dirty Drawful is immediately familiar. It’s a filthy take on the classic drawing game that just adds in a few naughty prompts, and again… we were all doing this anyway, and everyone knows it. None of us are free from sin.</p>

<p>The new game, and the final one in the pack, is Let Me Finish, a presentation game, which will always depend a little bit on how confident your group is, and also how good at improv they often are. That being said, me and my friends are all incredible charming, funny, attractive, generous, and humble, so I’m not worried about that. This game pits players up against each other while they try to present scenarios about what your washing machine gets up to at night. It’s a fun enough idea on paper, but man, it just feels sort of trite and forced.</p>

<p>And that’s the lot. There’s just three games in this bundle, and with two of them being reskins and prompt packs for older games puts a whole lot on the shoulders of Let Me Finish. There’s not much space for innovation and trying new ideas when you’ve only got one crack of the whip, and a lot of the excitement for each new Party Pack is seeing new ideas and themes. Not all of them land, but then there’s always a couple of highlights. You don’t get that here.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ultimately, Jackbox Naughty Pack is the worst Party Pack to date, and while the bar is pretty high on the whole – tee hee – that doesn't change the fact that this just feels like a miss. It certainly doesn't help that there's only three games and two of them reskins, but maybe what's funny about being pure filth in normal Jackbox games is that you're doing it even if the game isn't winking and nudging you constantly. Maybe making our own fun and our own filth is the way forwards to a truly naughty experience.	</p></div>

Fans have also asked to be able to pick the Chaos Space Marines Legion they want for every class in the game. This is currently not possible, which means that unlike the playable Space Marine Chapters, the Chaos Marine Legions are locked to a specific class.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Addressing this request, Focus and Saber said there were “many lore restrictions” preventing the development team from doing this. “For instance: we cannot make a sniper with a World Eater armor.”</p><p>There are additional challenges here, too, that have to do with the variety of Chaos Marine Legion armor types compared to the relatively consistent Space Marine armor.</p><p>“It is very tricky to match armor pieces for Chaos,” the companies said. “Armor pieces have different sizes and styles, will clip through each other, etc. Also, in PvP it is important to be able to recognize an enemy’s class, and we want to keep the visual identity of each of them. Now, we will not keep it as it is and would like to expand Chaos customization, but the reality is they won't be as modular as the Loyalist.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The reality is [Chaos] won't be as modular as the Loyalist.</p></div><p>That’s that for Chaos, then. But what about other issues with the game? The teams are working on the significant matchmaking issues, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-dreaded-joining-server-bug-makes-co-op-play-much-harder-than-it-should-be">which IGN has reported on</a>, as a “top priority,” with a bigger patch planned soon.</p><p>Improvements are also coming to the AI bots, which most players consider to be useless (“bots seem a bit passive because we don’t want them to take the spotlight from the player”), alongside tweaks to the veteran difficulty.</p><p>There are also balance changes outlined (the Blocking weapon trait, which inexplicably does not let you perfect parry, will be changed), the bullet spongy feel of enemies on higher difficulties will be tweaked, and various balance changes for PvP are incoming.</p><p>The update is also interesting because it rules certain requests out. Don’t expect full Battlebarge and Thunderhawk customization any time soon, for example. Restricting Operations Mode to not having two of the same class (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together">we’ve reported on the trouble this causes currently</a>) will remain for regular matchmaking, but “we are considering it as an expansion of private lobbies in the future. It will take us time to finish it.” The dev team is currently focused on improving matchmaking so players will not matchmake with players of the same class, which should help.</p><p>There’s also a plan to combat toxic players who kick teammates late during a game (incredibly frustrating!) to let their friend get the XP.</p><p>And what about new classes, perhaps the most-requested feature from players (Apothecary please!)? “That is definitely something we are heavily discussing. Adding a new class is quite heavy on production as we also need to create all the customization, PvP Chaos model variant, and animation set depending on what we go for. We'll keep you updated about this topic.”</p><p>Space Marine 2 players have asked for a field of view (FoV) slider and left / right shoulder swap features. Here’s what the team had to say on each:</p><p>“FoV slider is not something we are comfortable with, as it can degrade the visual aspect of the game. And on top of that, it is very complex. Our game is not a first person shooter, the camera that we have is very cinematic and constantly changes position and FoV based on what you are doing. Still, we understand that is a very popular request so we are considering it anyway.</p><p>“As for the shoulder swap, if we are to implement shoulder swap we will need to support it for all melee animations and transitions because everything in melee combat was made based on the fact that you hold pistol in the left hand and melee weapon in the right hand (because it looks badass). Nevertheless, shoulder swap is a feature we will not add in the game.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gun-strikes are a risk/reward action, and it is very easy to spam.</p></div><p>Here’s an interesting one: some players have called on the developers to add invincibility frames (i-frames) on gun-strikes (high damage shots only possible after staggering an enemy). This won’t be added, however. “Gun-strikes are a risk/reward action, and it is very easy to spam. We specifically did not put an i-frame on it for balancing reasons, and we are not looking to change this intention.”</p><p>Meanwhile, we also have details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>what fans can expect from Space Marine 2’s seasonal post-launch content model</u></a>. Season 2 runs from October until the end of 2024, and includes a new Operations map, a new enemy, a harder difficulty level, a new weapon, and various other improvements. We also have a story on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>the probable enemy faction for the inevitable Space Marine 3</u></a>, and a story on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-youtube-comment">Saber’s refusal to say whether an 'imposing morals on gamers' YouTube comment is from its CEO</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/a18468b9407c3de92af500bac7e0f07bdc13140d-1726674254856.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 First Q&amp;A:</h2><p><strong>CONNECTIVITY ISSUES</strong></p><p>We know some of you are experiencing server issues, loss of saves or impossibility to connect with friends. We are ramping up our server capacity to reduce the load on them, and are working day and night to reduce the issues. This is a top priority for the team. A bigger patch is planned soon to improve this topic further, alongside new content.</p><p><strong>AI BOTS</strong></p><p>Question: Bots are regularly mentioned as inefficient, making solo games significantly harder, and you suggested we work on them. According to you, they don’t participate in focusing on objectives or don’t do enough in tense situations.</p><p>Answer: Bots seem a bit passive because we don’t want them to take the spotlight from the player. However, they can sometimes be a bit too passive. In the next patch, we have a few improvements of their behavior against boss fights in the campaign. We are also considering improving their involvement during specific objectives in the campaign for a later patch.</p><p><strong>CAMPAIGN</strong></p><p>Q: Veteran difficulty is said to be too hard in solo as the bots don’t help with the objectives.</p><p>A: We will adjust Veteran difficulty in a future patch. It will remain challenging but it will be slightly more fair because we will tweak AI aggressiveness on this difficulty. Other difficulties will remain untouched.</p><p><strong>ABOUT PVE…</strong></p><p>BALANCING</p><p>Q: Assault is often listed as less powerful than other classes: the jump pack in PVE loses its versatility compared to the one in the campaign.</p><p>A: We are still collecting data on this issue to see how we can work on it.</p><p>Q: The Blocking weapon trait is seen by the community as a bad thing for melee weapons as it removes the potential for mastery (because there is no “perfect” parry window).</p><p>A: We fully agree that this is a bummer, and we’ll definitely make changes in a future patch.</p><p>Q: Bolt Rifle family is underperforming while Melta Gun is considered OP</p><p>A: We have noticed a bug where the Melta allows the user to heal above the contested health, we aim to fix this in the next patch. As for the rest of weapon balancing, we hear you, and some weapons can underdeliver on the power fantasy at higher difficulty levels. We also recognize that enemies can be too bullet spongy on higher difficulty, which is not much fun. That’s the core issue, rather than the bolters themselves. For now, we are testing some tweaks in difficulty to make the enemies have less health but keep the engaging difficulty.</p><p>QUALITY OF LIFE</p><p>Q: You asked to be able to have several of the same class, in Operations mode. There is also frustration in matchmaking when two players want to be the same class.</p><p>A: For now, we are focusing on improving matchmaking so that you will not matchmake with players of the same class. This is not an easy fix, so it will take us some time to roll it out. As for using the same class, we don't want to change that rule for regular matchmaking, but we are considering it as an expansion of private lobbies in the future. It will take us time to finish it.</p><p>Q: It was observed that players tend to show toxic behaviors as they get kicked late during a game made by a group of friends to let their friend get the XP.</p><p>A: We understand this is unfair, and each player will receive XP based on his actual involvement in the mission.</p><p>Q: Saved loadouts don’t include skill tree customization, making them less relevant.</p><p>A: This is not a priority for us at the moment.</p><p><strong>ABOUT PVP…</strong></p><p>MATCHMAKING</p><p>Q: You have suggested making it possible to tag as a squad of 6.</p><p>A: We understand this need. We want to add custom PvP lobbies and give players more control over the match (for example: frag limit, class restriction, etc.). It's not that easy to make and it takes time! So please bear with us while we work on it, and we will let you know when we have clearer visibility on when it will be released.</p><p>BALANCING</p><p>Q: It was brought to our attention that shock grenades are OP. Also, many of you consider melee to be underpowered.</p><p>Q: Assault is considered weak in PVP. Bulwark is overpowered in capture zones. And, Heavy is overpowered: too much damage for its durability.</p><p>A: Regarding pvp balancing, we are currently reading and crunching the data. We don't want to make rash decisions before seeing the global picture. At the moment we are checking the most common topics such as melee balancing, shock grenades, bulwark &amp; heavy being too present in capture game modes. Expect some tweaks in the first big content patch but not before.</p><p>Q: No team balancing after matches creates unbalanced matches for several matches in a row.</p><p>A: We have heard this many times, and we want to improve this in future patches. We are looking into it!</p><p>SPAWNING</p><p>Q: Spawning locations can create spawn-kill situations.</p><p>A: This will be tweaked with some parameters in a future patch. We will implement spawn protection.</p><p><strong>MOST UPVOTED TOPICS ON FOCUS TOGETHER</strong></p><p>Q: Are we getting new colors for the lenses?</p><p>A: New lens colors are planned and coming soon in the next big patch!</p><p>Q: You asked to pick the Chaos Space Marines Legions you want for every classes:</p><p>A: There are many lore restrictions preventing us from doing this (For instance: We cannot make a sniper with a World Eater armor). It is very tricky to match armor pieces for Chaos. Armor pieces have different sizes and styles, will clip through each other, etc. Also, in PvP it is important to be able to recognize an enemy’s class, and we want to keep the visual identity of each of them. Now, we will not keep it as it is and would like to expand Chaos customization, but the reality is they won't be as modular as the Loyalist.</p><p>Q: Many of you have asked for new classes:</p><p>A: That is definitely something we are heavily discussing. Adding a new class is quite heavy on production as we also need to create all the customization, PVP Chaos model variant, and animation set depending on what we go for. We'll keep you updated about this topic.</p><p>Q: About the missing armor colors:</p><p>A: We aim to expand specific color masks, such as hand, decals or facemask, in upcoming patches. We will be adding all successor chapters eventually. ;)</p><p>Q: Adding new melee weapons:</p><p>A: New melee weapons would definitely be an extremely cool addition. Making a weapon and designing it is fine, but we need to make all finisher animations for it. It will take time.</p><p>Q: Customizing your Marine’s face:</p><p>A: Not a quick fix, but we will add an option to change your Marine’s face!</p><p>Q: Optimizing PvP Crossplay:</p><p>A: We need more time to discuss that. Custom PvP lobbies will solve a good part of the issue.</p><p>Q: Thunderhawk Customization:</p><p>A: Doing full Battlebarge and Thunderhawk customization is very cool but not up in our priority list. We prefer to focus our art teams on creating new maps.</p><p>Q: Pyreblaster in PvE or PvP:</p><p>A: We will add it but it will take time because of visual and gameplay progression. We’ll keep you updated!</p><p>Q: To be able to customize the AI squad mates:</p><p>A: Still in discussions.</p><p>Q: Delete Custom Armor Profile:</p><p>A: We worked on this. In the next patch, you will be able to overwrite a custom preset with a default one.</p><p>Q: FoV Slider and Left / Right Shoulder swap:</p><p>A: FoV slider is not something we are comfortable with, as it can degrade the visual aspect of the game. And on top of that, it is very complex. Our game is not a first person shooter, the camera that we have is very cinematic and constantly changes position and FoV based on what you are doing. Still, we understand that is a very popular request so we are considering it anyway.</p><p>As for the shoulder swap,if we are to implement shoulder swap we will need to support it for all melee animations and transitions because everything in melee combat was made based on the fact that you hold pistol in the left hand and melee weapon in the right hand (because it looks badass). Nevertheless, shoulder swap is a feature we will not add in the game.</p><p>Q: Get rid of class restriction on cloaks and tabards:</p><p>A: These are part of class identity; you get to recognize snipers because of those elements.</p><p>Q: I-Frames on gun-strikes:</p><p>A: Gun-strikes are a risk/reward action, and it is very easy to spam. We specifically did not put an i-frame on it for balancing reasons, and we are not looking to change this intention.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-massively-oversold-internal-ea-projections-ex-bioware-dev-reveals<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age Inquisition</a> was far from a commercial failure, a former BioWare developer has insisted while revealing an updated sales figure for the game.</p><p>Fantasy action role-playing game Dragon Age Inquisition launched in 2014 to critical and commercial success, enjoying the biggest launch in Bioware history based on units sold. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age Inquisition review</a> returned an 8.8/10. We said: "Dragon Age: Inquisition doesn't spin a great tale, but it brings the series closer to its roots with deep RPG systems."</p><p>Now, 10 years later, former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah, who left BioWare in 2020, has revealed that Inquisition has sold over 12 million copies, and “massively” oversold EA’s internal projections for the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah I'm not sure where "DAI was a commercial failure" came from...<br>Its over 12 million at this point.<br>MASIVELY oversold the internal EA projections<br>...<br>Oh yeah and was GotY in 2014.</p>— Mark Darrah (@BioMarkDarrah) <a href="https://twitter.com/BioMarkDarrah/status/1836034762332340630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Why would Darrah say this now? The ex-BioWare staffer took to social media to counter claims from one user that Inquisition was a “commercial failure.” That comment emerged from a social media conversation about the Dragon Age series apparently losing its “super serious and grimdark” tone following the release of the first game in the series, 2009’s much-loved <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Origins</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>That feeling is fueled by an ongoing debate about <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>’s stylized look and action-oriented gameplay, which in truth the series has been pointing towards ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> came out in 2011. The long and short of it is that some Dragon Age fans long for the bloodier, darker cRPG-styled Origins, while The Veilguard is more the natural evolution of Inquisition, a game that had already left Origins behind in gameplay and art style terms and, as Darrah has explained, enjoyed enormous commercial success in doing so.</p><p>The Veilguard launches a decade after Inquisition, and IGN’s exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-first-hands-on-preview">Dragon Age: The Veilguard hands-on preview</a> offers a really helpful look at what to expect from the game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>GameSpot parent company Fandom has released its sixth annual Inside Fandom study, and this one reveals insights into how people play and feel about games and general entertainment.</p><p><span>One of the key findings of the study, called The Power of Me Time, is that 54% of consumers spend their free time on gaming and entertainment each week. The study found that 80% of consumers said they considered playing games or watching TV/movies as a passion, beating out other popular interests like music (75%), food and cooking (52%), sports (44%), and travel (38%).</span></p><p>Further, the study found that gaming can provide an emotional outlet--and a positive one. Respondents reported feeling more stimulated, accomplished, and focused after playing games. People reported feeling relaxed, happy, and zen primarily when watching TV or movies. This compares to other leisure activities like sports, which the study found elicited feelings of frustration and anxiety.</p><p>For gaming, the study concluded, "These positive emotional experiences explain why entertainment and gaming continue to hold such a prominent place in consumers' lives, offering a welcome escape and a chance to recharge."</p><p>The study also found that people who watch TV/movies and play games also seek out further information and discussion about their favorite franchises on social media and the internet in general. The study said 52% read or post about their entertainment interests online, while 50% seek out fan-created content on YouTube and TikTok.</p><p>Many love to share their opinions, and that's reflected in the study, too, as 43% said they enjoy talking about their favorite shows, movies, or games with family and friends, while 27% reported looking on the internet for more information about their favorite franchises by way of seeking out behind-the-scenes details or new details about characters they like. The study also found that 26% listen to podcasts that are based on their favorite TV/movie and gaming content.</p><p><span>The study is based on a survey of 4,000 consumers, complemented by first-party data stemming from Fandom's network of 350 million monthly unique users.</span></p><p>For more, check out the <a href="https://www.fandom.com/insidefandom/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Fandom website</a> to learn more about the Power of Me Time study.</p>

                <p>The final chapter in Cal Kestis' story will be told by Respawn Entertainment, according to EA. The information was shared during EA's<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI"> Investor Day 2024 presentation</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Respawn developed both 2019's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/">Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and its sequel, 2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/">Jedi: Survivor</a>, so the studio is a natural pick for the third and final chapter in the trilogy, but EA's comments during the presentation confirm that the third entry in the series is actively being developed.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have delivered some of the highest quality and best-selling Star Wars games of all-time, with over $5 billion in net bookings," EA president of entertainment and technology Laura Miele told investors during the presentation. "This impressive track record includes of course the Star Wars 'Jedi' games, where over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi. Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players."</p><p dir="ltr">Jedi: Survivor launched four years after Jedi: Fallen Order, so Star Wars fans may have to wait a few years to get their hands on the trilogy's final entry. EA didn't comment on the upcoming game's release date, but the absence of Stig Asmussen--who directed both Jedi: Survivor and Jedi: Fallen Order--could impact the game's development timeline.</p><p dir="ltr">Asmussen left Respawn in September 2023--a few months before Jedi: Survivor's April 2023 launch--and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-and-god-of-war-veteran-announces-new-studio-working-on-aaa-unreal-engine-5-single-player-game/1100-6521780/">currently working on his own AAA</a> project. Prior to leaving the studio, he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-director-wants-to-make-cals-saga-a-trilogy" rel="nofollow ">told IGN</a> that he hoped to develop a third "Jedi" game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I always wanted to see this as a trilogy," Asmussen said of a potential third game.</p><p dir="ltr">But EA seems to have faith in the team that replaced Asmussen.</p><p dir="ltr">"Veteran Respawn leaders will be stepping up to guide the team as they continue their work on Star Wars: Jedi Survivor," EA <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-13/electronic-arts-executive-behind-star-wars-hits-leaves-company" rel="nofollow ">told Bloomberg</a> after announcing Asmussen's departure in 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">"You should imagine that there's some other things going on at Respawn that we're very excited about, that we're not going to talk about, but that we're very excited about just given the quality of that group," EA CEO Andrew Wilson said at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Presumably, the same Respawn veterans that took the reins in the wake of Asmussen's departure are taking the lead on the final game's development.</p><p dir="ltr">EA released Jedi: Survivor for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the same day as the investor presentation (September 17), giving players on last-gen console a chance to catch up on the story.</p>

			<p>Following the July beta, Amazon Games and NCSoft were supposed to<a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> launch the free-to-play MMORPG Throne and Liberty on September 17</a>, but they decided on a small delay to October 1 to add more features from the Korean version that's already live and some fixes decided following the feedback of Western players. This extra time allowed us to set up an email Q&amp;A focused specifically on the global launch of Throne and Liberty and what players can expect next from the Amazon/NCSoft duo.</p>
<p>Below are the answers provided by Daniel Lafuente (Globalization Design Manager at Amazon Games). As a reminder, Throne and Liberty will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X; on PC, NVIDIA users can take advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-midnight-suns-the-day-before-dlss-3-dead-space-dlss-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS</a> 3 technology to boost the frame rate. Wccftech can also confirm that the game <span>will be available on GeForce NOW</span>, allowing fans to play via the cloud.</p>
<p><iframe title="Throne and Liberty - Combat" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-syPRMktNcA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What feedback gathered from the Open Beta will be implemented in Throne and Liberty in the future?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve worked closely with NCSoft to incorporate critical player feedback from all of our testing rounds. We have just <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/launch-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a comprehensive article that details the major variations in the Launch version. Some of the changes we’re most excited about are the addition of Skill Specializations and even more improvements to camera and character controls.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to publish detailed Patch Notes before the start of the Early Access?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. We think it’s important for players who have followed the development of Throne and Liberty to learn about what’s different since they last played our test versions.</p>
<p><strong>Will players get a detailed roadmap of when Korean content and balance patches will be introduced to this version of the game?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It’s our goal to share our roadmap and content plans with our players throughout the life of the game. We’re working on the first installment and will release it during the Early Access period. Consistency is important to us so we’ll make sure to provide updated plans quarterly. We want you to be informed so you can plan accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it be until the two versions of the game are at near-parity (meaning that there is only a small delay from Korean patches)?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is it depends on how our players progress. It’s important for us to find the sweet spot between releasing content before people are prepared and releasing it too late. While we have estimates about timing right now, we want to confirm them with actual data. We will consider things like vertical progression, content completion rates, and more. When we have the opportunity to release changes that improve the player experience without jeopardizing the overall player journey, we’ll work to bring that to our version as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>A good example of us moving quickly is with how we pulled Skill Specializations—a feature recently released in Korea--forward into our launch version. We also have a couple of surprises in store for you about unannounced content that you’ll hear about from us first.</p>
<p><strong>Right now, there are only seven weapons. Are you planning to add more classic weapons, such as maces, war hammers, axes and great axes, spears, etc.? If so, when could players expect to see new weapons?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, new weapons will be part of our post-launch roadmap. We can’t talk more about it at the moment, but we can tease that players won’t have to wait too long to see the first new weapon added to the game. We will be sharing more details on future content through our previously mentioned roadmap communications with players.</p>

<p><strong>Will the launch version include the Substance Transformation system (AKA the Gamba System)?</strong></p>
<p>We will share this information in our upcoming blogs and release notes which will describe the key changes between the Open Beta and Launch versions. There are several features that we will discuss in the same context of the Substance Transformation system.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to add cross-progression across platforms?</strong></p>
<p>No. We evaluated the benefits of cross-progression across platforms prior to release, and there wasn’t a significant demand. Cross-platform play, however, is very important to us because it empowers guilds and groups of friends to play together regardless of their chosen platform.</p>
<p><strong>Throne and Liberty is free to play, and bots have already troubled the Korean version. What are you doing to minimize the issue for the Western release?</strong></p>
<p>We’re taking the learning experience from our other games to help launch Throne and Liberty in a better state. We’ve made some significant progress against bots overall, and player sentiment regarding bots has increased. Aside from what we’ve learned from other games, we do have other ways we are preparing to handle bots in Throne and Liberty:</p>
<p>We are analyzing and training our bot fighting models with anonymized data from the Korean Live Service. This is helping build the foundation of the model that we can, in turn, use to identify bots within the Amazon Games service. We are also putting several safeguards in place to protect the economy, including protections against fraud and auction house abuse. For players familiar with the Amazon Games trust system, we are working to improve its capabilities significantly and expect to have this ready for Throne and Liberty’s launch. We plan to moderate auction house usage based on trust status.</p>
<p>We will have strict punishment for players caught participating in third-party real-money trading, including suspensions, bans, and applying negative balances when Lucent is reclaimed after RMT is identified. Lastly, we have plans to make RMT more difficult for bad actors, however we cannot disclose those methods at this time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Throne and Liberty - Cooking" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLumFsLDI5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Will the Milestone System be tweaked to speed up progression?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Milestone System will unlock at a faster rate than it did during the original Korean Launch. The details of the unlock speed will be shared in our previously mentioned Patch Notes and Roadmap article.</p>
<p><strong>What's your outlook for PvP, especially open world PvP? What kind of plans do you have for it?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things we are most proud of for Throne and Liberty is the variety of content across both PvE and PvP. Together with NCSoft, we have plans to continue improving PvP elements and introducing new modes for players. While we can’t go into details today, we can confirm that new modes of PvP are a part of our near-term roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Your FAQ says that after an Auction House purchase, a temporary trade hold is placed on all Lucent in the player's account inventory. How long will this hold be?</strong></p>
<p>We are going to update our FAQ as it is misstated. To add clarity: After purchasing Lucent, players are able to immediately use it within the in-game shop. However, Lucent is subject to a temporary waiting period before it can be utilized in the Auction House. In other words, the hold takes place before you spend the Lucent in the Auction House. The amounts and times can vary by many factors which we cannot discuss at this time as it relates to our Fraud Protection mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to add support for player-made addons or mods? If not, will you add a combat log and/or damage meter?</strong></p>
<p>We do not have plans to support addons or mods at this time. The question about a damage meter is tricky. At its best, it’s a core tool to help players improve their performance and test new builds that they may want to engage with. At its worst, it can become a tool for toxicity in the community and in the game. While we are continuing to have discussions on this topic internally, our goal is to find an approach that can provide the most benefit to players without introducing systems that lead to toxicity within the community.</p>
<p><strong>In Western countries, PvE is particularly important. Are you planning to add more challenging endgame dungeons and raids on a regular basis?</strong></p>
<p>We agree that PvE is important for a wide range of international players and Throne and Liberty has consistently added more of that type of content. Co-op Dungeons, Challenge Dungeons, Gate of Infinity, Cooking, Fishing, and Amitoi Expeditions are just some of the non-PvP features that have been added recently. We plan to continue adding more PvE and PvP elements to the game.</p>
<p><strong>What is your plan for major additions, e.g., expansions? Would those be premium expansions or free, and what would be the cadence?</strong></p>
<p>Our focus right now is on delivering the best launch experience possible. The Korean live game has recently received a major new content update in the form of an expansive new region called Talandre. It introduces a level cap increase, new world bosses, additional co-op dungeons, PvP territories, and more! We’ll discuss more about when that content will be available for international players of the game but for now we can confirm that it will be free when we release it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Throne and Liberty - Amitoi Expedition" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6lj3zojIYE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Several users have reported that preorders are unavailable in many European countries on PlayStation 5. Is Amazon looking into the issue?</strong></p>
<p>We are aware of the reports by players that started during the Open Beta about purchasing Early Access Packs. We are working to make sure it is resolved in all countries that will be supported by Amazon Games, but for those countries outside our supported countries we will not allow purchasing of the Early Access Packs.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modders-working-on-delivering-a-wyll-cinematic-universe/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Compared to all of the other companion characters in Baldur's Gate 3, Wyll's story is by far the shortest. As a result, Baldur's Gate 3 modders are working to rectify that, and want to remedy "Larian's mistreatment" of Wyll, the Blade of Frontiers by creating a Wyll Cinematic universe. Larian Studios continues to release patches that are chock-full of content, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/">Patch 7</a>, which had many conversations and interesting cutscenes for those who are doing evil playthroughs. Still, there isn't really any content being added for Wyll, the Blade of Frontiers.</p>
<p>As a result, modders take the character under their wing and try to do him justice by creating a new cinematic universe for him. Two modders, Magnetuning and Aimryax, have made it their mission to DIY his story and have started working on a project that they've named the "Wyll Cinematic Universe (WCU)," which will be a series of mods that add to his story and conversations to provide more context for the Blade of Frontiers.</p>
<p>So far, they have released the first part of the project, a mod named "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brightest Star</a><span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">—A New Act 3 Romance Scene For Wyll</a>," which does exactly what it says on the tin. To make the scenes as immersive as possible, they have spliced together voice lines from those already in the game and utilized Wyll's cuddle animation, which</span>&nbsp;was in early access but then removed later down the line.</p>
<p>The mod details the steps you need to take in Act 3 to unlock this scene. It is currently locked firmly in the dock camp, and players will need to take a specific course of action to trigger the conversation.</p>
<p>As stated above, Wyll has the least content out of the six origin characters, with his time amounting to roughly eight hours, whereas Astarion, the fan favorite, has 12 hours of content. Compared to the other characters, he seems to be forgotten and left to trail behind the others. Even in patches and updates, there is still a disparity, with Wyll continuing to suffer from major bugs, such as missing captions in Act 3. Although Patch 7 addressed some of the bugs and added a bit more content, the other origin characters still got significantly more out of the patch, as they tend to do in previous patches, too.</p>
<p>The mod has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1fjo3nb/the_first_custom_cutscene_mod_wyll_act_3_new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted to Reddit</a>, and they are considering reaching out to Theo Liston, the voice actor for Wyll, to see if he would be open to doing some voice work for the mod to help bring the mods to life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-patch-released-playercount-triples-as-a-result/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Arrowhead has finally released a new patch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wont-feature-a-story-mode-reveals-arrowheads-new-ceo/">Helldivers 2</a>, which allows players to feel stronger when they should and adds more diversity to their gameplay. In this update, they did a significant overhaul of the anti-tank, armor penetration, and health and armor values. Overall, the weapons and stratagems have been balanced, and enemies have been reworked to make the game a more enjoyable experience. As a result of this, the player count tripled. The day before the patch rolled out, the player count hit a 22,000 peak. However, post-patch, it climbed to a 68,000 peak once it fully rolled out.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is the highest player count the game has gotten since its release, as the player numbers have steadily declined since its release in February of this year. Additionally, the game has a 20% off sale on Steam, coinciding with the new update so that new players will get the proper experience rather than the strained one from the previous patch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 Patch Notes - Patch 01.001.100" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cCIOlSQIT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Although previous patches added new maps and more content to Helldivers 2, this patch seems to have benefited players most, as it made many changes. The patch notes are extensive, with weapons being buffed significantly to damage enemies more, making the game more enjoyable for the players.</p>
<p>This patch also added the Galactic War feature, a War map that displays the location of important assets, making it much easier for teams to decide where to go and where they should navigate in battle. Additionally, there is now an Emote Wheel feature, with players able to hold up to four Emotes, which can be equipped via the Armory.</p>
<p>While this patch predominantly focused on buffing player damage and nerfing enemy damage, it also included a ton of crash fixes and soft-lock fixes, optimizing the game even further and making it more playable. The game had many crashes when interacting with certain enemies or objects and when players hot-joined.</p>
<p>Although the patch notes are extensive and include many changes and repairs, they are aware of quite a few known issues that they still have to work on repairing and have listed everything they intend to fix in future patches. This includes units not having audio cues, friend requests not working, and social menus getting stuck.</p>
<p>In addition to the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/7147864422081646859?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> written patch notes</a>, they also released a video discussing the changes they've made. This allows you to digest the patch notes via video rather than reading the huge number of changes the developers have made to Helldivers 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-documentary-will-tell-a-troubled-development-story-next-month.984534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-documentary-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World has announced a new documentary about the making of the game and how it's been impacted by Russia's ongoing invasion of the studio's native Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>War Game: The Making of Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will air on October 3rd, and it's being made in conjunction with Microsoft. The movie will be directed by the creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/power-on-explores-history-of-xbox">Xbox documentary series&nbsp;<em>Power On</em></a>, although this one won't come in multiple parts.</p>
<p>In the trailer description, GSC Game World says that February 24th, the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, "changed our world and lives forever". Suddenly, a game that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december">already experiencing development difficulties</a> was now being made in a war-torn nation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-documentary-road.jpg?itok=61qGthFR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-documentary-road.jpg?itok=gmqPPcXA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has undergone some pretty hefty trials and tribulations over the course of its development.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the stirring sound of Metallica's classic "Nothing Else Matters", the&nbsp;<em>War Game&nbsp;</em>trailer features GSC Game World developers talking about their experience of making the game while its native country was in defense mode.</p>
<p>One developer says that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has become "an element of resistance" for the studio, while another says the team "load our weapons with one hand and make the game with the other".</p>
<p>As the trailer concludes, one GSC Game World staffer affirms the studio's commitment to "finish this game" and "make it awesome". It's all very stirring stuff, and it makes me hope against hope that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is going to turn out as great as the devs want it to.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>War Game</em>, which also shows off some of the footage you can likely expect to see in the finished documentary, right here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited followup to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which uses the Russian spelling of the word rather than the Ukrainian Chornobyl).</p>
<p>You'll once again take the role of one of the titular Stalkers, hunters who look for treasure in the irradiated exclusion zone of Chornobyl.</p>
<p>The game will feature a "photorealistic seamless open world" in which you'll encounter different NPCs and factions with their own agenda, battle horrifying monsters, and experience "immersive survival mechanics" like hunger, a need for sleep, and radiation.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC and Xbox Series X|S on November 20th (assuming it's not delayed again). You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-get-in-zone">read our preview of it here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Yesterday I watched a Youtube video about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, in which sundry, gesticulating milords of the internet opine that they had "forgot what it's like to be the target audience" for games, hailing the new (and for our money, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">fairly good</a>) Warhammer 40K <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> as a throwback affair that "oozes masculinity", with no excess feelings or real-life social relevancy. I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In it, the poster thanks youtuber Asmongold for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBUqCUZ0swE">video</a> and characterises Space Marine 2 together with the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> as a "reversion" to an "old school" era, when "games were simply about fun and immersion". He also mentions games he allegedly encountered during his time at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">noted layoff manufacturer Embracer</a> "that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers". The comment has now been seized upon and widely disseminated as Saber coming out as anti-woke, "woke" being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke">appropriated</a>, catch-all term for leftwingers and especially those who campaign against racism, transphobia and sexism. Here it is in full:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hey man. CEO of Saber here. I love your videos. When we signed the deal to make Space Marine 2, all I wanted was a throwback game. We had the chance to work on something which by its nature was "old school". I can't even comprehend many of the current games that we play these days. They are too complex and too much of an investment. We worked on Halo back in the day, and that game could be distilled down to the simplest of shooting loops, but it was entirely addicting. That is what we wanted to recapture. I hope that games like Space Marine 2 and Wukong are the start of a reversion to a time when games were simply about fun and immersion. I spent some time as Chief Operating Officer at Embracer and I saw games there that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers. We just want to do some glory kills and get the heart rate up a little. For me that is what games should be about.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this <em>actually</em> Matthew Karch? Saber won't say. The user in question <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MatthewKarch">registered his account in May 2024</a>. He describes himself as a "generic male of sorts - lover of loud guitars, violent games, fast cars and all sorts of whisky", which is certainly generic. Suspiciously so. I asked a PR representative to help me confirm the account's legitimacy yesterday. Fast forward to this morning, and Saber have told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-youtube-comment">IGN</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836116821541331088">Kotaku</a> that they won't be commenting on the subject, which would typically be PR speak for "yes, it's real". Except.</p>
<p>Except that I genuinely find it hard to believe that Karch is the author, inasmuch as the "imposing morals" gambit is such a brass-necked piece of culture war bait. There's that drive-by mention of Wukong, a Soulslike created by a company with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">a reputation for sexism</a> which, following the discovery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">PR guidance cautioning streamers against "feminist propaganda"</a>, has become a pillow fortress for people who live in terror of anime boobs getting smaller. There's the boilerplate appeal to "gamers", as though people who play games habitually were some kind of hapless protected demographic, and the needlessly broad and perhaps deceptively childlike comment that games should simply be about "fun and immersion".</p>
<p>If I were Karch, I'd find it cringey to be associated with such a transparent jumble of thinly camouflaged reactionary talking points. It reads like it's been slapped together on 8chan to rile up the Twitterati. It reads like it's been AI-generated, using the prompt "it reads like it's been slapped together on 8chan to rile up the Twitterati". I would probably want to come out and disavow it.

<p>Space Marine 2 is proving an interesting line to walk for those who rail against the "woke". Being a Warhammer 40K game, it’s an interesting line to walk for everybody, at every point on the ideological spectrum. In some respects, it's a pretty "woke" game. The cast includes Black Space Marines and women in frontline combat roles – a source of anguish for certain members of the Warhammer playerbase who are convinced that modern-day Games Workshop has been irrevocably tainted by the heresy of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. On the other hand, its a story about bulky bros stamping on space bugs while bellowing about god-emperors. There’s been some <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2183900/discussions/0/4514380548231077905/">heated granular discussion</a> of the game's degree of wokeness on the Steam forums.</p>
<p>Of course, all this is just the latest flicker in the decades-old optical muddle that is Games Workshop’s Imperium of Man, on whose behalf those tank-footed Space Marines wage war. Conceived partly in response to Thatcherite Britain, the Imperium is a satirical and grotesque portrayal of a xenophobic, mass-murdering, patriarchal theocratic empire. You’re not supposed to seriously buy into the values depicted. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-workshop-reminds-fans-warhammer-40ks-imperium-of-man-are-the-bad-guys-after-a-player-wore-nazi-imagery-to-a-tournament">But some people do</a>, partly because after years of people telling and selling stories in such a setting, the thrust of the satire has gotten lost beneath the merchandising. I guess it's thanks to that submerging of the political relevancy that "Karch", whoever he really is, doesn't seem alive to the irony of deriding other games for "imposing morals". (Thanks to Nic for suggesting this last observation.) </p>
<p>Somebody claiming to be Space Marine 2’s creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick has also commented on the Asmongold video, though his comments are a lot more guarded. Here's his response in full.</p>
<blockquote>Creative Director of the game here. I wrote Space Marine 2 along with Craig Sherman, Randy Begel and Matthew Garcia-Dunn. Hearing everything you have to say about the story and characters resonates so strongly with our actual approach. It's great to hear you calling out the exact things that we intentionally focused on. It was four and a half years of intense work and passion and watching videos like this makes it all worth it.</blockquote>
<p>As it happens, I interviewed Hollis-Leick earlier in the week. We discussed a bunch of things, ranging from more innocent chat about the game's jump pack implementation to how you do a Space Marine power fantasy that isn’t an endorsement of bigotry and genocide. I was going to publish a write-up this week. But in the wake of this alleged Karch comment, and more broadly in light of the game’s reception, I’m going to give those pieces more thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
