<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/faze-clan-six-invitational-win-back-to-back/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Six Invitational has finally wrapped in Paris, and FaZe Clan stands victorious. The organization is the <strong>first </strong>in Rainbow Six esports history to win back-to-back Six Invitational tournaments, marking a spot in the history books.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan beat Team Secret in the grand final in Paris, defeating the <strong>fan-favorite side</strong>, to lift the hammer and secure the $1 million prize. It was no big <em>secret </em>that the crowd was firmly against FaZe Clan in Paris, especially given the presence of Team Secret’s French competitor, Mowwwgli, who has failed to win on home turf.</p>







<h2 id="h-faze-clan-has-won-this-year-s-six-invitational">FaZe Clan Has Won This Year’s Six Invitational</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan has lifted the hammer in Paris in front of a roaring crowd, for better or worse. Today’s excitement was kicked off by Ubisoft unveiling this year’s Rainbow Six roadmap, and it blew the roof off the stadium.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" id="176941">Solid Snake as an Operator</a> to Ranked 3.0, and from a new social hub to four stacked seasons this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" id="176923">Year 11 is <strong>heavy</strong></a><strong> </strong>for Rainbow Six Siege fans.</p>



<p>As with almost every other year, the schedule began with a glorious Six Invitational, which is regarded as one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business. It’s a multi-million-dollar event backed by Ubisoft, and this year, it went to Paris. It was recently revealed that <strong>next year’s event </strong>will be heading to Brazil.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan, which claimed the prize last year in Boston, had a brilliant tournament through and through. From a top finish in the group stage with just one close loss to a storm through the upper bracket in the playoffs, FaZe Clan refused to relent.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the grand final, FaZe pushed out Fluxo W7M, Wildcard, and Team Falcons, all before meeting Team Secret in the ultimate showdown. Team Secret also had serious momentum, having gone on a wild lower-bracket sprint and eliminating some heavy players to make it into the final series.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan was relentless, hitting Team Secret with an insane 3-1 finish. The first series on Consulate wrapped with a 7-4, while Bank saw FaZe yield a 7-2 scoreline. Team Secret came back miraculously on the final map, Fortress, pushing the game into OT, earning the team a slight respite.</p>



<p>It wasn’t enough to clutch up the final map, though, leaving FaZe Clan to secure another map win in OT on Border.</p>



<p>Last year, Team Secret won at the Esports World Cup, while FaZe Clan dropped out hard in 10th place. It’s safe to say that FaZe redeemed itself in Paris by winning back-to-back Six Invitational tournaments.</p>

<p>Edmund McMillen is one of the creators of the new cat-breeding roguelike game called Mewgenics. So far, the game has been released only on PC, where it holds a “very positive” review score based on over 10,000 reviews.</p>



<p>Recently, McMillen responded to a Twitter question about when players can expect a console release. In response, he said it’s currently being worked on, but they don’t yet know when it will be completed. However, it may be in development for all systems.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-mewgenics-is-a-smash-success">Mewgenics Is A Smash Success</h2>



<p>Mewgenics, in its first week on the market, is currently sitting at 89 on Metacritic with an overall user score of 8.1. The game currently has over 115,000 concurrent players on Steam, breaking its previous record of over 102,000 set earlier this morning. Edmund McMillen has been pleasantly surprised by the success.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game features a voice cast of several long-time internet personalities. Among those are Ethan and Hila Klein from h3h3 and iDubbbz. McMillen recently responded to criticisms of the casting choices, explaining why he stands by them and how long the process took.

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2 </a>Virtual Boy accessories support VR-enabled Nintendo Switch games.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Virtual Boy is coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Nintendo Classics catalog on February 17. To play Virtual Boy games, Nintendo is releasing two headset accessories. One headset will be a full-size Virtual Boy mock-up. The other is a cardboard version.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-new-virtual-boy-accessory-works-with-existing-switch-titles">Nintendo’s New Virtual Boy Accessory Works With Existing Switch Titles</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/confirmed-switchs-virtual-boy-headset-can-play-vr-supported-switch-games-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-mario-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Video Games Chronicle,</a> these accessories will work not only with Virtual Boy games but also with existing Nintendo Switch games that support VR. Nintendo, as part of its Labo lineup, allowed players to build their own cardboard VR headset.</p>



<p>To experiment with VR, they added specific game modes for four titles: Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. It’s also noted that the Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild retains the VR option</p>



<p>Per VGC, the main Nintendo Virtual Boy accessory, designed for stationary use, includes the classic red Virtual Boy filter over the lenses, but players can remove it to play Switch VR games in full color. The cardboard accessory is actually a wearable headset.</p>







<p>Check out the full list of Virtual Boy games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online on launch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/virtual-boy-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-in-february/">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/billionaires-found-the-next-dumb-thing-to-gamble-the-economy-on-and-its-the-moon-2000669225</link>
            <guid>1436863</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I know we’re all at our limit with tech ventures that the financial powerhouses of the world rapidly rally around as more foundational and beneficial resources to civilization wane. I know we don’t have enough ear space to fill with all the promises of utopian computer advancements that in practice require comical amounts of human intervention. That after all of the crypto, NFTs, AI, video pivots and pets.com collapses, the last thing we need is more gambling on speculative futurist nonsense. But hear me out: what if we fucked with the moon?</p> <p>This week, Deutsche Bank said they are fixing their attention to the “moon economy.” Earth’s lonely little celestial satellite, greeting us each night, shifting the tides and summoning werewolves. Though the grand prize of the 1960s space race, it hasn’t really taken center stage in the human imagination for generations. While we love our big floating space rock, it doesn’t have the potential or allure of Mars, our nearest understudy. The richest among us have begun to feel otherwise.</p>

 <p>Deutsche Bank’s focus is on Intuitive Machines, a Houston-based company developing tech for lunar exploration. They’re primed for the windfall of any moon-bound interest, and Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu says the moon economy “may have just gone through a key inflection point.” Which is to say we’re gearing up for a nitwit-off.</p> <p>Through 2025, the White House stated a renewed interest in moon missions. As part of the Artemis program, the U.S.A. is looking to beat China to the moon for military infrastructure and spycraft securities. That space race has kicked off a second, simultaneous one amongst billionaires. Jeff Bezos announced that Blue Origin is aiming to develop lunar landers for the program. It plays into the tension between NASA and SpaceX, whose progress on their contract has been sluggish.</p>

 <p>Incapable of sitting still, Elon Musk, who previously wrote off the moon as “a distraction,” said he is shifting SpaceX’s focus toward building a “self-growing city” there. It’s a screeching pivot for SpaceX, a company whose sole mission is colonizing Mars. “We can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk posted.</p>

 <p>Obviously government contracts are a financial boon in and of themselves. Much of Musk’s fortune comes from federal arrangements. But what’s the long-term economic benefit of chilling on the moon? Never mind establishing the first space city? As far as space campaigns go, it’s much easier to launch off a low-gravity body than fighting to escape Earth’s orbit and barrier of space junk (though new complications will surely emerge). You probably wouldn’t be surprised to hear this moon situation links up with the current AI situation.</p> <p>You’ve probably noticed AI, for all of its promises, is incredibly expensive. Consumer technology is in disarray as firms get first dibs on microchips. Data center construction is the toothpick holding up the American economy. The use of electricity and water cooling is exhaustive to local infrastructure. To set up camp on the moon would solve… some of that. If you think that sounds risky and untested, you’re correct. Just like current AI ventures, a loose promise is enough to bet the house on.</p>

 <p>The original space race ended on a win, something our current futurists are desperate to secure. It came through sweatbox collaborations between technicians, physicists and experts across all disciplines. It was to prove the capitalist west was greater than the USSR and develop some new rockets along the way, but still required putting that glory before short-term gains. The theme of the last decade has been “why we can’t have nice things.” There are strong use cases for the blockchain, language learning models and moon bases alike. But instead of researching and refining how this tech can secure a better future for all, we’re subjected to useless tchotchkes at the cost of breathable air. Our survival into this century is increasingly beholden to refried futurists, addicted to singular persuasive visions that don’t behave well with reality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideki Sato, the designer of all major Sega consoles, passed away at the age of 77 on February 13.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?s=20">The Japanese outlet Beep21 </a>reported his passing on its social media channels. He is widely regarded as the “Father of Sega Hardware.” He served as director of Sega’s Research and Development department during the heyday of the console war between Sega and Nintendo.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>セガハードの父として知られる<br>佐藤秀樹氏が昨日ご逝去されました。</p><p>日本のゲーム史<br>そして世界中のセガファンを魅了された<br>本当に偉大な方でした。</p><p>あの時代のワクワクと挑戦心は、<br>未来永劫、永遠に多くのファンの<br>記憶に残っていくことと思います。<br>心よりご冥福をお祈りいたします。</p><p>Beep21</p></div>— Beep21 (@Beep2021) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-hideki-sato-s-reflections-on-sega-genesis-design">Hideki Sato’s Reflections on Sega Genesis Design</h2>



<p>Speaking about the launch of the Sega Genesis, known as the Mega Drive outside of America, Sato told <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu </a>in a Sega retrospective that there was a belief that customers would appreciate video games in the same way they had with music. As such, they chose to make it look like an audio device.</p>



<p>“Since the Mega Drive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player. So we painted the body black and put the “16BIT” lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-sato-wanted-wireless-controllers-for-the-sega-dreamcast">Sato Wanted Wireless Controllers for the Sega Dreamcast</h2>



<p>The Sega Dreamcast was Sega’s final hardware release. When discussing the platform, he noted some of his wishes for the console. He noted that he wanted a more cube-shaped design, similar to the Nintendo GameCube, but he really wanted wireless controllers.</p>



<p>“Personally, I wanted a more cube-shaped design like the Nintendo Gamecube, but we ultimately ended up with what you see today. One thing I truly wanted was wireless controllers. Those long cords are annoying. Next time, it will be wireless for sure! (laughs)”</p>



<p>That was a generation ahead, as wireless gameplay would not become the pack-in standard until the PS3 and Xbox 360 generation. A true innovator.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming sends its condolences to the family and friends of Hideki Sato.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade could be coming to more platforms in the near future.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stellar-blade/" id="1204">Stellar Blade</a> was originally a PlayStation exclusive in 2024. It was later ported to PC. Developer <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=316&amp;category=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> is now touting the game’s success in its recent Q3 earnings report. They are also looking ahead to the Future of the Stellar Blade IP.</p>



<p>In the latest quarter, the game continued to sell copies steadily. In particular, the PC port saw strong sales, and its very positive Steam rating was highlighted in the report.</p>







<h2>Stellar Blade Could See Releases on New Platforms</h2>



<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/shift-up/" id="1687">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> expects the game’s popularity and overall brand to continue to grow. Additionally, they plan to make the game accessible to even more players. </p>



<p>To do that, they plan to run promotional sales across both platforms and are even considering expanding to platforms beyond PlayStation and PC.</p>



<p>“To further enhance brand recognition and boost sales, we plan to carry out various promotional activities and are considering additional platform expansions to make Stellar Blade accessible to more players,” it’s noted.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-era-of-console-exclusives-continues-to-fade-away">The Era of Console Exclusives Continues to Fade Away</h2>



<p>Not only is PlayStation porting some of its popular exclusives to PC, but Microsoft continues to push the idea that “Everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>As such, major Microsoft releases, such as Halo, are now being ported to PlayStation. The strategy will continue, as the forthcoming Fable title will also be available on PlayStation. <span>Learn more about Xbox games on PlayS</span>tation&nbsp;at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-studios-head-admits-inconsistency-in-multiplatform-release-strategy/" id="171816">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>

			<p>The next game directed by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>, the Game Director behind 2007's <strong>God of War II</strong> and 2018's <strong>God of War</strong>, wasn't shown at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 State of Play</a>. However, according to two of the most reliable insiders, it is targeting a <strong>Summer reveal</strong> ahead of a <strong>tentative 2027 release</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NatetheHate</strong> <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2022409747539071233?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted as much on X</a>, while adding that he will probably be able to share more information about the project in the future:</p>



<p><em>Cory is working on his own project and it remains unannounced. I'll share more when I can. We will hear about it before 2027. My expectation is around Summer.</em> <em>Unless a major delay happens, the game will be out in 2027.</em></p>



<p>Another renowned insider, <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <strong>corroborated this </strong>on the ResetEra gaming board, where someone surmised that Cory Barlog's game might be targeting 2028 while a smaller team prepares for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly announced <strong>God of War remake trilogy</strong></a>. However, the insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151277215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>Not that far (barring any delays, of course).</em> <em>Like I said, given the quarter they're targeting, I do expect that [it will be announced this year]. Probably May State of Play or the summer Keighleys (SGF). As of now, I don't know yet. If not by then, then they've either pushed the release out further or doing a shorter reveal to release.</em></p>



<p>In September 2021, Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> he wouldn't direct <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, leaving that role to <strong>Eric Williams</strong>. He was still credited as Creative Director and Producer for that game, but he also began working on another game that, <strong>several years later, remains shrouded in secrecy</strong>. There have been rumors that it could take place in a sci-fi setting, but it's nothing solid.</p>



<p>The only solid rumor came in July 2025 from Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <strong>the project was going well</strong> and that while it is not technically a new intellectual property, <strong>it might feel like it</strong>. This appears to be a hint that Barlog and his team at Sony Santa Monica are <strong>possibly working on a PlayStation IP that is being revived</strong> after a long slumber. If the insiders are correct, we're only a few months away from the announcement, anyway. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>"What David and Alexandre bring to Dead by Daylight is a rare balance of character driven storytelling and relentless genre intensity," said Jason Blum, Blumhouse's founder and CEO.</p>
<p>"Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale."</p>
<p>Behaviour seem similarly happy with the writers, too.</p>
<p>"Alexandre and David are two modern masters of horror, and their script celebrates a dark distinction, Dead by Daylight is a game, its world is a nightmare," added Stephen Mulrooney, producer and Behaviour's chief product officer.</p>
<p>"We look forward to working with a director who appreciates the depth of their story, and cannot wait to see their visceral vision brought to life."</p>
<p>We found out that Blumhouse - the horror-focused movie production company behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, and Get Out - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-is-turning-dead-by-daylight-into-a-movie">plans to adapt Dead by Daylight into a film back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The project is being developed in conjunction with Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive and Atomic Monster (the production company run by prominent horror director James Wan), with the latter calling the game's "incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains...perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation".</p><p>Dead by Daylight launched its asymmetrical multiplayer horror - which sees four survivors attempting to escape a powerful killer - back in 2016, and the game's been played by over 50 million people since then and features some of cinema's most iconic horror villains, including Halloween's Michael Myers, Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface, Saw's Amanda Young, and Scream's Ghost Face.</p>

            <p>Hideki Sato, the designer of most Sega home consoles, has allegedly died.</p>
<p>As announced by Sega history zine Beep21, Sato – known as the "father of Sega hardware" – reportedly died on Thursday, 13th February. He was in his late seventies (some sources put <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/allcityslopshop.com/post/3met6tgjqg22b">him at 77</a>, <a href="https://segaretro.org/Hideki_Sato">others 75</a>).</p>
<p>"Known as the Father of Sega Hardware, Mr. Hideki Sato passed away yesterday," Beep21 announced, as translated via machine. "He was truly a great figure who shaped Japanese gaming history and captivated Sega fans all around the world.</p>
<p>"The excitement and pioneering spirit of that era will remain forever in the hearts and memories of countless fans, for all eternity. Rest in peace."</p> <div>

<p>Sato joined Sega in 1971, led the research and development department in the early 1990s, and served briefly as president at Sega in the early 2000s. He and his team developed most of its hardware systems from the SG-1000 to the Dreamcast, including its arcade machines, until he left the company in 2008.</p><p>"[Our home consoles] sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes, thinking we might sell half a million!" Sato said, recounting his time at Sega with <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">Famitsu</a>, and archived at <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">shmplations</a>. "It was a scale completely incomparable with our arcade board sales. And that is how our entire company caught Console Fever, and threw ourselves into that side of game development.</p>
<p>"We had a feeling that before long, consumers would be appreciating video games with the same sense with which they enjoyed music; moreover, since the Megadrive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player," he added. "So we painted the body black and put the '16BIT' lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console."</p> <div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/rainbow-six-siege-snake-david-hayter-voice-metal-gear-trailer-2000669204</link>
            <guid>1436734</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-4-is-finally-getting-a-port-wont-be-trapped-on-ps3-2000668326"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em>‘s bandana-furrowing Snake</a> is teaming up with <em>Splinter Cell</em>‘s Sam Fisher and the rest of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>‘s roster as the tactical shooter’s newest operator. After teasing the collaboration earlier this year, Ubisoft finally pulled back the curtain with a reveal trailer that has the two heavyweights of video game espionage bro-ing out before taking down some baddies.</p> <p>The Solid Snake Operator arrives in <em>R6 Siege</em> with Operation Silent Hunt in the new season on March 3. One of the big questions facing the crossover was whether David Hayter, the original voice of Konami’s protagonist (created by Hideo Kojima) would be returning for such a weird and unexpected side project. The new trailer reveals that the answer is “yes.” Fans are relieved but wish Sam Fisher could have been voiced by a returning Michael Ironside as well. Still not in the budget, apparently.</p>

 <p>Here’s the<em> R6 Siege</em>‘s version of Solid Snake in action:</p>  <p>The reveal trailer shows Snake doing Snake stuff like hiding around corners and taking enemies out with a silenced weapon before sending in a smoke grenade and handing out takedowns. Sam Fisher pops up at the end, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upsxB_VxWn0">two embrace <em>Predator</em>-style</a>, and Snake quips about “soldiers like us” never getting a moment’s rest as a new alert pops up on his pager.</p> <p><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> currently has over 70 operators with Sam Fisher, codenamed “Zero,” added all the way back in 2020 as part of Operation Shadow Legacy. Outside of playable characters, the shooter’s past crossover collaborations have included everything from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and <em>Resident Evil</em> to <em>Tomb Raider</em> and<em> Halo</em>. It’s not <em>Fortnite</em> levels of branded content but, like the people behind all modern live-service games, <em>Siege</em>‘s developers at some point realized how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">more money there is in licensed cosmetics than in-universe kits</a>.</p>

 <p>Snake’s arrival is perfectly timed to take advantage of excitement over last year’s<em> Snake Eater</em> remake and the upcoming <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster via the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, coming in August. While it’s not clear yet if Konami will ever give Snake a new adventure, the franchise is alive and well on modern platforms. The same can’t necessarily be said for <em>Splinter Cell</em>. A remake is <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-biggest-game-franchises-are-going-backwards-2000668403">still MIA</a> and it’s been over a decade since <em>Blacklist</em> came out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New information concerning the internal hardware expectations of the next Sony PlayStation has surfaced.</p>



<p>Do not expect the next Sony PlayStation console to use only AMD’s upcoming RDNA 5 GPU. During a recent discussion on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-xbox-magnus-rdna-5-finalized.1693408/page-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum</a>, reliable tech leaker KeplerL2 noted that the PS5’s internals are a hybrid of RDNA1 and ray tracing, and that the “PS6 isn’t full RDNA 5 either.”</p>







<h2 id="h-further-hardware-expectations-for-the-next-gen-sony-ps6">Further Hardware Expectations for the Next-Gen Sony PS6</h2>



<p>In another recent post, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/">Kepler claimed</a> that the PlayStation 6 could have up to 30 GB of GDDR7 memory. The often-discussed next-gen Sony handheld could also feature up to 24 GB of LPDDR5X memory. If that is the case, it would be on par with the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>The rumored handheld is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/">expected to be dockable. </a>It’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-portable-can-definitely-run-ps5-games-leaker-clarifies/">expected to run PS5 titles</a>. Still, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/">not expected to be as powerful</a> as the current PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>However, don’t expect to see the next set of PlayStation consoles on the market <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/">until at least 2027.</a></p>







<p>Speaking of next-generation hardware expectations, AMD recently said that it was preparing to support a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-says-next-xbox-console-may-launch-next-year/" id="173908">2027 launch for the next Xbox console.</a> However, Microsoft has since said it is not committing to a hard launch date for its next hardware lineup. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-not-committed-to-hard-2027-launch-for-next-xbox-its-claimed/" id="175153">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/edgar-allen-poe-cult-classic-horror-steam-pc-2000669201</link>
            <guid>1436710</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Myst</span></i><span> was the first game to show the world what CD-ROMs were capable of. In the wake of its runaway success, countless new teams emerged to capture the public’s enchantment with PC multimedia, including bigwig Hollywood players. From </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg%27s_Director%27s_Chair"><span>Spielberg</span></a><span> to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Warrior"><span>Shaw Brothers</span></a><span>, they correctly assessed that gaming would have a permanent stake in commercial entertainment, though their FMV-forward approach may have missed the mark. It made the mid-90s’ output of PC gaming a particularly interesting slice. One of the most curious bits of software came from a strange union between Time Warner Interactive and poet William S. Burroughs. It returns this weekend with an official Steam release, albeit under a bizarre new handle.</span></p> <p><span>Originally hitting shelves in 1995, </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> is part point-and-click adventure game, part book report. Visiting your eccentric uncle Edwin, you poke and prod around a drafty manor, uncovering salacious family affairs and playing audience to stop-motion renditions of Edgar Allan Poe’s most famous tales. Not puzzles per se, but navigating around the dreamlike estate is cryptic enough. Add in ashen claymation puppets and narration from Burroughs, whose voice itself is like a gust whirling through the rattling doors of places abandoned, and </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> easily secured a cult status. Like most games from Inscape (such as </span><i><span>Drowned God</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Bad Day on the Midway</span></i><span>), it is as adored as it is difficult to find a hard copy of.</span></p>

  <p><span>This weekend, GMedia brings about an official Steam release of the gothic gem. Running off ScummVM, GMedia promises an authentic experience. With one noticeable change: the game has been renamed as ‘</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4289030/Edgar_Allan_Poes_Interactive_Horror_1995_Edition/"><i><span>Edgar Allan Poe’s Interactive Horror: 1995 Edition</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p> <p><span>Why they’d deke around the original title is no mystery. “</span><a href="https://ulisses-us.com/games/tde/"><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i></a><i><span>“</span></i><span> is trademarked by a long-running and immensely successful German tabletop RPG of the same name. That </span><i><span>Dark Eye</span></i><span> has numerous licensed video games, including a couple from Daedalic Entertainment on Steam. The real intrigue is why GMedia would settle on </span><i><span>this </span></i><span>name in particular. Could have called it <em>Poe’s Dark Mind</em>, <em>The Tell-Tale Heart: A Telltale Games Series</em> or <em>The Cask of A-Supermario</em>. SEO-friendly or not, it’d be nice to say a title ten times fast without becoming the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzd11GMBONg"><span>Micro Machines guy</span></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span>’s resurrection is part of an altogether pleasant trend. A surge of oddball bygone PC games have been made more accessible lately through fan translations, patches and even official Steam releases. Only four years ago, Tomomi Sakuba’s notoriously menacing </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946430/Garage_Bad_Dream_Adventure/"><i><span>Garage: Bad Dream Adventure</span></i></a><span> reemerged on modern hardware with quality-of-life features and multiple new translations.</span></p>

<p>Ubisoft has unveiled the full Rainbow Six Year 11 roadmap during the Six Invitational in Paris. On one of the grandest stages in the esports landscape, Ubisoft uncovered the next year of Rainbow Six Siege content, and things are looking great.</p>



<p>The breakdown started with a new trailer that revealed the death of Phobos. From there, the team talked about Ranked 3.0, balancing changes that will update how players enjoy the game (looking first at entry and roaming, and the new cadence with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>Check out everything you need to know below.</p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-year-11-roadmap-is-more-siege-more-often">Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 Roadmap is ‘More Siege, More Often’</h2>



<p>The running theme of Rainbow Six Siege’s Year 11 roadmap is, according to Ubisoft, ‘more Siege, more often’.</p>



<p>That all begins with a hefty array of new seasons coming to the game over the next 12 months. For some reason, the team started by detailing <strong>season four</strong>, dropping at the end of the year.</p>



<p>This update will be all about <strong>teamplay</strong>, and to accommodate better collaboration, a new <strong>social hub </strong>will be implemented. A new ‘testing grounds’ playlist will also drop in season four, with Ubisoft monitoring feedback and seeing what needs to change before Year 12 kicks off.</p>



<p>Towards the end of Year 11, a new strategic option is coming to the test area in the form of <strong>half reinforcements</strong>:</p>

<p>In Y11S4, the Hostage mechanic is also going to get a major rework. Additionally, The Grand Larceny, a limited-time event not seen for almost <strong>six years</strong>, is coming back.</p>



<p>Players will be able to prove their expertise with specific Operators in Y11S4, too, leaning on Operator Mastery tiers. As the team said, this gives your time with these characters ‘more meaning’.</p>



<p>Y11S3, which will drop <strong>before season four</strong> (obviously), introduces a new Defender with a brilliant counter for shield users, codename: <strong>Firework</strong>. The small teaser we got for the unnamed character revealed a gadget that can punch clean through shields.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Y11S2, the in-game esports tab is getting a huge update, allowing fans of the competitive scene to better connect with and follow their favourite competitors.</p>



<p>This season will also welcome a new Rainbow Six Siege map, pulled straight from Rainbow Six Vegas – <strong>Calypso Casino</strong>. It’s a ‘tribute to the amazing Vegas games from Rainbow’s past,’ said Alex Kaparzis, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" id="173856">former Creative Director of the game</a>.</p>



<p>Y11S2 will also yield a remaster for Dokkaebi, giving her a ‘more personal and targeted approach’ as well as a new primary weapon to broaden her arsenal. It was stressed that the weapon won’t be locked behind a battle pass but will be available to all users when it drops.</p>



<p>But what about what comes in the first season of Year 11?</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/">Y11S1 welcomes Solid Snake</a>, the protagonist of the <strong>older </strong>Metal Gear Solid games. He’ll be joining Zero as a new Operator, and he’s coming on board with a standalone story to set him up nicely in the universe.</p>



<p>The first season of Year 11 is themed almost entirely around Metal Gear. There’s a new event named [REDACTED] that brings MGS-themed skins and a limited-time 4v4 mode, a string of cosmetics coming in the battle pass, and, of course, Solid Snake himself.</p>



<p>He’s coming in as a one-health, three-speed Operator with unique voice lines, a new gadget, and a sweet loadout.</p>



<p>The first season, Operation Silent Hunt, launches on March 3rd. It’s set to welcome modernized maps, a 1v1 arcade mode, and a huge balancing overhaul, amongst other things.</p>



<p>For your information and perusal, here’s the full Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 roadmap:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Solid Snake is coming to Rainbow Six Siege in Y11S1, a season dubbed ‘Operation Silent Hunt’. He’s coming into the game as a <strong>permanent Operator </strong>and has unique, new voice lines recorded by the iconic David Hayter. He’s coming to the Rainbow Six world with unique gadgets, weapons, and an immense aura.</p>



<p>During the Six Invitational in Paris, France, Ubisoft debuted a short trailer that saw Solid Snake welcomed to the franchise by none other than Sam Fisher. The team went on to reveal that Konami has provided iconic sounds from the Metal Gear series for his arrival in Rainbow Six.</p>







<h2 id="h-solid-snake-is-rainbow-six-siege-s-new-operator">Solid Snake is Rainbow Six Siege’s New Operator</h2>



<p>The short trailer that was revealed to unveil Solid Snake went down like a storm at the Six Invitational in Paris. Towards the end of January, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-rainbow-six-siege/">Solid Snake would be coming</a> to the game as a new Operator by dataminers, which prompted many to fully expect a full reveal at the Six Invitational.</p>



<p>And here it is:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Solid Snake will be a one-health, three-speed Operator, which means he can’t take a hell of a lot of damage, but he’s fast, which is what you’d expect from one of the stealthiest heroes from the gaming world.</p>



<p>His loadout is already iconic and features the F2 assault rifle, the PMR90A2 battle rifle, and the TACIT .45, a powerful and suppressed handgun. His OSP Pouch gadget provides a unique radar and early warning system, which is where the sounds iconic from the Metal Gear series come from.</p>



<p>To welcome Solid Snake to the game, a new event has been set up for Y11S1, now one of the most highly anticipated seasons in recent years. It’s called [REDACTED], and it sees some of the most recognizable characters from the Metal Gear franchise surface as skins in an exclusive 4v4 mode.</p>



<p>And of course, a stack of battle pass cosmetics is coming too:</p>
