			<p>Surreal, surprising, and a bit silly are the best ways to describe Keeper, but with this being a game from Double Fine none of that is unexpected. Keeper is narrative puzzle experience, casting you as a lighthouse exploring a world that is in the grip of The Wither, accompanied by your bird friend Twig who is trying to get back to their family. None of this overtly explained, as there is no dialogue in Keeper with Double Fine trusting you to put some of the pieces together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Keeper starts off with your little lighthouse coming to life and growing legs. It is like a newborn creature and in the first moments you will fall over a lot while working out how to walk – though this is far from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/baby-steps-review/">a Baby Steps situation</a>. Soon, your feet are found and you start walking along the path with only one real goal, and that is to get to the top of the mountain.</p>


<p>Climbing a mountain is tough in the best of times when you’re a creature that has evolved to be very good at walking, so doing it as a lighthouse in a world that has lots of obstacles in the way sounds tricky. However, the way Keeper is laid out means the experience is hardly ever frustrating through its six hour runtime, though there is minor annoyance with some of the movement and the lack of ability to control the camera through more open areas. Sometimes, aiming your light can be a bit fiddly too.</p>


<p>Puzzles in Keeper start off very small. Your lighthouse can shine its light and focus it to highlight points of interest, interact with items, and clear paths. Where switches and levers need to be moved, Twig comes into play to move these switches to open doors and reveal more paths for you to follow. The more you venture into the world the bigger the puzzles get, with later ones using whole environments that hold the keys to passing. At no point does a puzzle get too hard, with many designed to kind of funnel you to the solution so you do not get stuck, but I do wish that there was something a little bit more mentally taxing.</p>
<p>That said, solving the puzzles in these areas is not all you should be focusing on. Among the different environments are little hidden areas with broken statues. With your light, these statues can be pieced back together, and you will unlock an achievement for each one. Double Fine has used the achievements system to expand Keeper’s lore, so you can learn more about what happened to the world.</p>

<p>Keeper looks fantastic throughout, with loads of variations in environments which feeds into how you play the game, constantly throwing up unexpected twists to the gameplay which keeps it fresh. The environments are really well detailed with lots of bright and colourful areas, juxtaposed with darker areas that reflect the mood of the story. My advice is take your time in each area, shine your light on the plants and inhabitants to watch them react and help the world bloom. I spent quite a bit of time in each place just shining the light on different things to see what would happen.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Keeper captures the essence of Double Fine, packaged in a heartfelt and surreal world where you never quite know what will happen next. The gameplay regularly surprises, but the lack of challenge in even the more elaborate puzzles is a bit of a drawback, along with not being able to control the camera.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Marc-Alexis Côté, the former head of the Assassin's Creed series at Ubisoft has clarified a key detail of his sudden departure from Ubisoft. Earlier this week, we learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">through an IGN report (which Wccftech independently verified),</a> that Marc-Alexis Côté had left Ubisoft after 20 years with the company, 16 of them working on the Assassin's Creed franchise, and his final three as head of the entire franchise.</p>



<p>Côté's departure was framed as a result of the restructuring caused by Ubisoft's new subsidiary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a>, a branch opened to house the Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry brands that Ubisoft established in collaboration with Tencent. A Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed to Wccftech by email that Côté "<em>was offered various leadership roles [within Vantage Studios] but respectfully declined</em>," and refused to speak further about the roles in question.</p>



<p>According to Côté, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">in a post on his personal LinkedIn account</a>, that's not how things shook out.</p>



<p>"<em>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin's Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice,</em>" Côté writes.</p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin's Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside."</em></p>



<p>So, while Ubisoft's version of events can still be technically true in that there was a potential role for Côté within Vantage Studios that he said no to, we now know that Ubisoft did not really give Côté a choice in the matter, and it almost seems like their preference was to lose a stalwart of the series, someone who had been through key periods of the franchise in lead creative roles, and who knew the franchise so intimately he could be at the helm of everything to do with Assassin's Creed, than to keep him.</p>



<p>It cannot be overstated that Côté's loss is a big one for Ubisoft, since veterans like him can be essential to keeping a long-running franchise alive and well, not just for their own leadership capabilities but also for their ability to mentor the next generation. Pushing out one of the people most knowledgeable about Assassin's Creed at Ubisoft is not necessarily a great start for Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>In any case, it'll be interesting to see how the Vantage Studios co-leads, Charlie Guillemot, the son of Ubisoft's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes, carry the series forward.</p>

			<p>A long time ago, developers Double Fine burst onto the scene with the flop that was Psychonauts, following this up with the equally floppy Brütal Legend. Of course, Psychonauts became a cult classic, and I enjoyed Jack Black's Musical Strategy more than most. However, these efforts resulted in Double Fine spending a few years creating smaller titles before the massive Kickstarter success of Broken Age, followed by Psychonauts 2's success on the Fig crowdfunding network, and the acquisition by Microsoft. This brings us to Keeper, their first game in four years.</p>



<p>So with that long introduction out of the way, let's talk about Keeper. You can tell this is a Double Fine game, with its unique art style, a story that is somewhat "out there", and just something that is generally difficult to pin down for one reason or another.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Let's start with what is easy to pin down: this is an adventure/walking simulator. There are puzzles, but I'm going to say it's not really a puzzle game because everything can be solved by just moving your character's head the right way, and then moving forward. There's no real thinking required. Sure, there are some where you have to shine your light on something, to free something else, and then take that something somewhere, but it's not going to test you.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not meant to test you. Keeper is about the journey and the story, more than anything else. The premise of the game is that you are a lighthouse that has gained sentience after a bird crashes into you. How you gained sentience, who knows? How you retain that sentience after (spoilers) being demolished, and being turned into a ship, a Beyblade, and then a crab-ship, I still have no idea.</p>



<p>What I do know is that the theme of the game, being about light fighting off darkness, is a little obvious, even if Double Fine has made it clear that the player is to take away from it what they will. The open cinematic is so reminiscent of Gandalf shining light to push off the Nazgul to save Faramir; it can't be a coincidence. If there is meant to be some deeper meaning, it was utterly lost on me.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, because there are positives to take away from Keeper. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, with an art style I can't take my eyes off of. The scenery and settings, particularly some of the stranger ones when magic comes into play, are like walking through beautiful paintings. There are some little secrets to find, so slight exploration is rewarded to an extent, but the problem is that Keeper is at its best about halfway through.</p>


<figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>I'll explain, but then it's going to be a bit more negative. Keeper has a part which opens up a little; it's still linear, but that's not a problem. What is important is that you surround yourself with candyfloss, and this allows you to jump into some straightforward platforming. There's no difficulty here, but it <em>feels</em> fantastic. As you move through the game, the feel of your character adjusts based on the form you're in, but it never feels better than this platforming candyfloss form.</p>



<p>This ends up being the core problem of Keeper, at least for me. I could be completely wrong, but the game feels like a wide range of levels and designs were created, and the game was extended to accommodate them. You reach close to the top in the Lighthouse form, then you crash down. Then, in a boat form, you go so far before being demolished. Then you're quickly in a Beyblade form, facing what could be considered the only 'boss', before being knocked out. Finally, you're the crab for all of twenty minutes.</p>



<p>The problem is that it doesn't feel organic in its progression, and, at least for me, there are only so many times I can do the same thing without it feeling like padding for the sake of padding. The second I'm playing a game and I'm thinking "I'm bored now", there's something that has gone wrong, which is a shame because that boredom goes away and Keeper finds its stride again a little later.</p>


<figure>
<div>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Keeper is a strange game, to say the least, and one that isn't easy to review. As gorgeous as it is, and as fantastic as the animations and characterisations of the Keeper and its friendly bird are, it is still one that ultimately outstayed its welcome while I was playing it. The thirty-nine stages could have been condensed, and the game, taking up to eight hours, would have been more effective and impactful if it had been an hour or two shorter.</p>



<p>Would I recommend giving it a go? For the art style alone, I probably would, yes. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, and there were moments that I genuinely had a smile on my face. It was a shame that there were other moments when I literally sighed and said, "I've had enough now," although this may not be the same for everybody.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve been using HP laptops for years now, and one reason I haven’t looked elsewhere during upgrades is that I enjoy the balance these offer between performance, reliability, and ease of use. The EliteBook lineup is especially a great option for work professionals, students, and casual users looking for a no-nonsense machine that doesn’t give up on you when things get challenging.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/">On a normal day, you can expect to pay a premium for these, but right now, the HP EliteBook 6 G1i is available for $1,119 on Amazon</a>. That’s a massive 63% off, but it’s a limited-time offer. Snag it before the price goes back to an unapproachable $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Visuals, Comfortable Keyboard</h2>
<p>The overall design is quite minimal, and the device itself is easy to carry around. You’re getting a 16-inch FHD+ anti-glare display that makes both streaming and browsing easy on the eyes. Expect lifelike, vibrant visuals in all lighting conditions. And since it actively reduces blue light, you won’t be left with tired eyes and blurred vision after a long day of work. The full-size keyboard is also quite comfortable to work on, and is even spill-resistant. A few accidental splashes won’t really hurt.</p>
<p>This model runs on a 12-core Intel Core Ultra 7 255U processor that’s built to keep up with even those busiest, most chaotic days. Speeds hit up to 5.2 GHz with Turbo Boost, making it great for enterprise users. The processor is paired with a massive 32GB of DDR5 RAM for better multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that ensures fast boot times and offers plenty of space for all your data. Whether you’re looking to store tons of media files, your favorite movies, or resource-heavy applications, it’s all possible.</p>



<p>For video calls, there’s a 5MP IR camera that makes you look your best, and Poly Studio tuned speakers with AI noise reduction to reduce background distractions. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, alongside a whole bunch of useful ports like two Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 Ethernet, and two USB-A ports. The system runs on Windows 11 Pro, which means you will have instant access to a suite of productivity and security features built right in.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this HP EliteBook. We highly recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade their everyday machine without going over budget.</p>

              <p>Sony’s <em>Horizon</em> legal battle against Tencent could get very messy, very quickly if a court doesn’t grant it an injunction. Also, a former <em>Call of Duty</em> director is worried about the franchise’s future under Microsoft. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Have you been watching the latest season of <em>Slow Horses</em> on Apple TV? The British spy thriller is by far one of the best shows on streaming and I can’t believe I never see anyone talking about it. It’s what I wish <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> had been like. I hope Apple keeps giving Gary Oldman absurd bags of cash to fart and scowl in front of the camera.</p>

 <h2>Sony was in talks with Tencent about a potential <em>Last of Us</em> spin-off</h2> <p>That’s the latest revelation from <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">an ongoing court battle</a> between the two companies over IP theft, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-the-last-of-us-game-sony-horizon-rejected/"><em>The Game Post</em> reports</a>. Why didn’t it come to pass? Apparently Tencent was just using the possibility to lure Sony into meetings so it could continually pitch the PS5 maker on <em>Light of Motiram</em>, aka “Project Z,” the <em>Horizon</em>-inspired game&nbsp;that’s at the center of the lawsuit instead.</p>

 <p>“I recall [a] slide [that] featured a female character with costume design resembling <em>Horizon</em>’s mix of tribal clothing and metal armor, and a robot/animal hybrid resembling a <em>Horizon</em> robotic animal,” Olivier Courtemanche, head of mobile for PlayStation, said in court filings. “Now that I have reviewed the promotional materials released for <em>Light of Motiram</em>, I believe that these images contained assets from the <em>Light of Motiram</em> game. I was confused by the slide given that we had rejected a potential <em>Horizon</em> collaboration and thought we were there to discuss&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, among other opportunities.”</p>

 <h2>The <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> movie is planned for 2027</h2> <p>According to the <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/">latest lawsuit filings</a>, the movie has a script and is in search of a director, with hopes of filming next year. “We are in development for a film based on <em>Horizon</em> in partnership with Columbia Pictures,” PlayStation entertainment production head Asad Qizilbash said in a filing. “We already have a working script and are actively searching for a director, with the goal of shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027. The live-action film follows the recent collaborations between Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions on the 2022 film <em>Uncharted</em> and the 2023 film <em>Gran Turismo</em>.”</p>

 <h2>Sony wants a preliminary injunction to halt Tencent’s <em>Light of Motiram</em> development efforts</h2> <p>Okay, so why is Sony telling a court about the <em>Horizon</em> movie? Because it would seemingly come out the same year as <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which is also scheduled to launch in 2027. Sony <a href="https://gamesfray.com/breaking-sony-asks-judge-corley-for-preliminary-injunction-against-tencents-upcoming-light-of-motiram-in-november-or-december/">wants a judge</a> to stop the Chinese conglomerate from moving ahead with this alleged <em>Horizon</em> rip-off even before the court case is settled.</p>

 <p data-cy="paragraph">“The copying was so egregious that numerous journalists and <em>Horizon</em> fans called <em>Light of Motiram</em> ‘a major <em>Horizon</em> rip off,’ ‘an obvious knock off,’ a ‘copycat’ with a main character that ‘resembles Aloy to a tee,’ and ‘extremely similar to <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>‘,” Sony wrote in recent filings, <em><a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post</a></em> reports.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The great irony of this case? It’s being overseen by Judge Corley, the same judge who ruled in Microsoft’s favor back in 2023 during the infamous <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-call-duty-deal-ftc-1850581517">FTC trial over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, which Sony desperately sought to prevent.</p>

 <h2 data-cy="paragraph">A former<em> Call of Duty</em> director is worried about the franchise under Microsoft</h2> <p>Glen Schofield was previously creative director at Sledgehammer Games. He says<em> Call of Duty</em> was better when he was there and he’s not sure Microsoft will make it any better.</p> <p>“I worry about it immensely, I really do,” he <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-call-of-duty-director-says-hes-immensely-worried-about-the-future-of-the-series-under-xbox/">told <em>VGC</em></a> in a recent interview. “Because what’s happening <em>to Gears of War</em>, where’s <em>Halo</em>…you know what I mean?

                <p dir="ltr">Super Meat Boy is the poster child for tough-as-nails precision platforming. The 2010 2D platformer starring a slab of meat was a viral hit in part because the game knew how difficult it was, and emphasized your repeated deaths by showing you each of them simultaneously once you finally completed a level. I've been curious to see how that 2D precision would translate into the realm of a 3D platformer. Unfortunately, based on a brief gameplay demo, the answer is: not very well.</p><p dir="ltr">My demo covered the earliest stages of the game, from a handful of tutorials through a few longer levels covered with traps and hazards. And to its credit, Meat Boy 3D nails the fundamentals of what you would expect from a Super Meat Boy game. You're once again a squishy, squelchy slab of unidentified, bloody meat, running through hazard-filled stages to save your girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the evil Dr. Fetus. At the end of every stage, you reach Bandage Girl, only to have Dr. Fetus snatch her away to the next stage. Then you get to watch a replay simultaneously showing your every attempt, with many Meat Boys scrambling ahead and all but one of them meeting their grisly doom, summarizing your journey through the stage. The irreverent humor is all very recognizable, even including a little warp pipe gag to reference Meat Boy's Super Mario Bros. inspirations.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="458476899" data-promo-id="0"

directions. Like its predecessors, Super Meat Boy 3D is focused on pushing you to move through levels as fast as possible--the tutorials introduce the dash button early, and you can't really get enough momentum for most jumps without it--and you're mostly going in straight lines or diagonals. Presumably this is to keep these early stages easily readable and to avoid overwhelming the player with too much freedom of movement before they really get a feel for it.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's not enough. To start, these environments are remarkably busy, with overgrown brush, vines, and grass. Later levels ventured into dank sewers full of rust-colored pipes and scaffolding. The original Super Meat Boy could get away with its lightning-quick pace and unforgiving hazards because the stage designs themselves were minimalistic and easy to read at a glance. Super Meat Boy 3D's environments, by comparison, tend to blend together, making it too easy to run straight into a hazard before you recognize that it even is one. And while part of the Super Meat Boy experience is learning-by-dying, these deaths feel like they aren't your fault--especially since you might suffer the exact same death, repeatedly, from a trap that just isn't easily visible.</p><p dir="ltr">It doesn't help that the movement of Meat Boy itself feels floaty and imprecise. On this point I have mixed feelings, because when I go back to the original Super Meat Boy, the movement in that game is similarly light, with lots of capability to steer Meat Boy in mid-air to make tough jumps and tight landings. But with so much more freedom of movement, that same approach doesn't work as well here. This is one area where the 3D conversion may have hewed too closely to the original source material, rather than adapting to the demands of a 3D space. The major new addition to Meat Boy's move set is a wall run, a novel addition that would seem to fit right in with the rest of his moves, but I never quite got down how to properly chain it with regular jumps, so it too suffered from feeling too floaty and imprecise.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586496-ss_1482c7dcfee531835ca458d57d2d3778ef288a8f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586496" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586496-ss_1482c7dcfee531835ca458d57d2d3778ef288a8f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586496"></a><figcaption>Super Meat Boy 3D</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586496-ss_1482c7dcfee531835ca458d57d2d3778ef288a8f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The moments when Super Meat Boy 3D works best, strangely, are when it functionally is not behaving as if it's a 3D game at all. The camera generally behaves like a traditional 2D sidescroller, tracking Super Meat Boy's movements from side to side and sometimes downward into the 3D planes. Sometimes a section of a stage will have you run straight forward, leap up a wall, and then jump between spinning blades, and those moments essentially just recreate the original Super Meat Boy platforming within a 3D environment. Mechanically, it behaves like the 2D version, and that's for the better.</p><p dir="ltr">Super Meat Boy 3D is slated for release in 2026, so there's time for the developer to polish and fine-tune the gameplay. If this 3D game can be tweaked enough to feel as good as the classic 2D platformer, Team Meat may once again have something special on their hands. For now, though, it's just as messy as Meat Boy himself.</p>

		<p>A The Horizon TV show was revealed by Sony in an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/27/gran-turismo-god-of-war-and-horizon-tv-shows-announced-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor briefing </a>in April 2022 and later on it was revealed that the show would be heading to Netflix. However,&nbsp; Steve Blackman, the showrunner for The Umbrella Academy and the Horizon series, was accused of “toxic, bullying, manipulative, and retaliatory behaviour”, claims that he denied, and the Horizon series was cancelled.</p>
<p>In January this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">Sony announced that a movie based</a> on the franchise was in the works at Columbia, the studio that made the Uncharted and Gran Turismo movies</p>


<p>Thanks to documents released as part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">Sony’s ongoing battle with Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, we now know that a Horizon movie is moving forward and could be on the big screens by 2027.&nbsp; The document reveals that Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions has stated that they already have a script and are looking for a director, with filming taking place next year.</p>
<p>A Horizon television show always seemed implausible as almost everything would have to be CGI, including the many robot creatures, and that would be very expensive. A movie will have a bigger budget and can focus on a smaller part of the Horizon mythology.&nbsp; Personally, I would like a story set right at the start of the mythology as the human race races to save itself, but ultimately becomes food for the self-replicating robots they created.</p>
<p>Sony also has a Helldivers movie on the cards, but no details have been revealed for that project.&nbsp; A sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced in 2024 and in December of that year producer Charles Roven said that a script was in place.</p>

<p>The issue seems to be the rather busy Tom Holland who spent this year filming Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey and is currently zipping around in spandex filming Spider-Man: Brand New Day.&nbsp; After that, he’s got American Speed on schedule, will Uncharted film after that?</p>

			<p>NetEase has announced that the popular free-to-play team-based 6v6 third-person online action game Marvel Rivals is getting its first PvE mode on October 23. It will be inspired by Marvel Zombies, the four-episode adult animated television miniseries released on September 24 via Disney+.</p>



<p>The announcement came with a brief video where Marvel Games Executive Producer Danny Koo explained:</p>



<p><em>In this Marvel Zombies inspired mode, you get to play as Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Land Shark, and The Punisher, taking on endless waves of zombies. You'll have to survive the Horde, go toe-to-toe with zombie Namor and the Queen of the Dead as bosses and fight to save the world from getting totally zombified. We have also given each hero some unique abilities. Charge through the hordes as Jeff, slice and dice with Blade's bouncing Moon Blades, shock zombies with Thor in his persistent Awakened state. Or go berserk as Magik in her unlimited Darkchild form. Showcase your epic combat skills against the zombie swarms and tough bosses.</em></p>

<p>More details are yet to come, such as when this limited-time event will end.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-launches-next-week-daredevil-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is currently up to its Season 4.5 'Heart of the Dragon'</a>, which launched last week and delivered the long-requested cross-platform progression feature. Moreover, it introduced Daredevil as the 43rd playable character. In the game, Daredevil is a combo-oriented Duelist (the archetype for high-damage characters) with plenty of mobility. The character also has a team-up ability with The Punisher.</p>

			<p>Thanks to Sony and PlayStation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">lawsuit against Tencent over Horizon knock-off, Light of Motiram</a>, we have an update for the previously confirmed Horizon Zero Dawn movie that's in the works. First reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/">The Game Post</a>, the movie is set to start filming sometime in 2026, and is intended to be out in theatres the following year, in 2027.</p>



<p>The confirmation came as part of the sworn declaration from Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, the branch Sony opened specifically for its film and TV collaborations and adaptations. According to Qizilbash, there's already a script in place, and PlayStation Productions is currently looking for a director.</p>



<p>"<em>We are in development for a film based on Horizon in partnership with Columbia Pictures</em>. <em>We already have a working script and are actively searching for a director, with the goal of shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027. The live-action film follows the recent collaborations between Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions on the 2022 film Uncharted and the 2023 film Gran Turismo</em>," Qizilbash writes in his declaration, per The Game Post.</p>



<p>Initially, PlayStation's adaptation of Horizon was intended to be a TV series produced in collaboration with Netflix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstations-horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-adaptation-will-now-be-a-movie-adaptation-instead/">though those plans were scrapped this past April</a> in favour of making a movie instead. Since the film still doesn't have a director attached to it, we're still a ways out from hearing about any casting decisions or ideas around what the film will cover.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see who PlayStation Productions is able to find to direct, and then where the search for who will play Aloy ends up.</p>

              <p>We all have our own sets of small inconveniences that make us irrationally angry. Mine is spotty internet, especially when its my own home. Occasionally when I’m in the bathroom, my router will just decide all by itself to cut its range in half, and then I’m left there caught in loop or refreshing before I give up and resort to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like it’s the dark ages. Stop this from happening in your home. Upgrade to a Wi-Fi mesh network to achieve total coverage around every corner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4837/">Amazon has the TP-Link Deco S4 mesh Wi-Fi system on sale right now. You can save as much as $50 for a limited time.</a></p>

Each are available as either a lone model or as a two-pack or three-pack. The Wi-Fi 5 AC1900 three-pack is down 25% from $120 to just $90, saving you $30.

That knocks off $50.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4837/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Total Coverage in Your Home</h2>
<p>Choosing the Wi-Fi 6 over the Wi-Fi 5 routers, you’ll be able to set yourself up with a super fast dual-band mesh network — achieving up to 1,201 Mbps on the 5GHz line and 300 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz line. You can cover every’ inch of your home, reach across up to 5,600 square feet. Eliminate dead zones and endless buffering.</p>
<p>The mesh network of routers can support up to 120 devices at a time, keeping them all connected and running at top speed. You can have your smart TV, Alexa, toaster, laptops, Nintendo Switches, and every phone in the family on the Wi-Fi plus a ton of extra tech without any hogging up the speeds and slowing down the other devices.</p>



<p>TP-Link Deco routers are protected with TP-Link HomeShield. This premium security service can keep everything on your home network safe with basic network security scans, device identification, parental controls, and frequent reporting.</p>
<p>Get rid of the daily frustration of bad internet today while saving yourself some cash.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review.1327759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like the thought of becoming an actual vampire, there are some things I really like about Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, and some I really don't care for. Developer The Chinese Room has undeniably done a remarkable job breaking out of its typically slow-paced and linear realm to give us a streetlight-soaked, open world Seattle that's enjoyable to explore, with a side of positively exquisite writing and voice acting. But combat never rises much above the level of being merely pretty good, and a lack of payoff for both mechanical and story choices hold this nocturnal sojourn back from greatness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The slice of Seattle that serves as a hub for Bloodlines 2's searching, stalking, and politicking is impressive to behold, though don't expect GTA scale here. At around five by five blocks with most buildings climbable and rooftops fully navigable, there’s quite a bit more room to prowl than in Bloodlines 1's Santa Monica, with several distinct and memorable areas from the charming Pioneer Square to the lantern-lit Chinatown. Moving around it by clamoring, leaping, and gliding is some of the most fun I had.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also where your semi-customizable elder, Phyre, will hunt their prey, in the form of hapless humans who can be provoked, scared, or seduced depending on your hunting style. I appreciate that feeding is a major, unavoidable part of the nightly routine, but I think it could have been done better in a couple ways. For one, you only need to feed to recharge your combat powers. In the tabletop game, you get thirsty upon waking up every night, and in Bloodlines 1, your blood pool would steadily drop over time. I don't think this needs to be a hardcore survival game, but something like that would have helped sell that vampires need blood like we need food and water, adding a sense of desperation, because right now it’s just something you need to top up before going into battle.<br>For another, there just isn't enough variety in the NPC models and voices to keep me fooled across the 30-plus hours my first playthrough took. I probably fed on one specific woman wearing the same exact hat at least a couple dozen times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are required to maintain the Masquerade while at street level, meaning no using your powers or feeding in front of normies, which is appropriate. You can't have a Vampire: The Masquerade game without, well, the Masquerade. But I did find it was a bit too easy to shake off any suspicion if I messed up.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bloodlines 2 can feel like a generic vampire game rather than a <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The key component of Vampire: The Masquerade lore that is almost completely missing (outside of one cutscene that happens no matter what you do) is The Beast, the dark and ravenous voice inside each vampire that drives them to do terrible things and can provoke an uncontrollable state called Frenzy. The absolute best mechanic in the 5th Edition of the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop game, upon which Bloodines 2 is based, is an increasing hunger track that makes your character more likely to behave in a monstrous or unpredictable manner the longer they've gone without feeding. I get that people don't usually like losing control of their character. But this is so crucial to the vampire fantasy that its absence is an almost fatal flaw. It's the one choice that really consistently made me feel like I was playing some generic vampire game, not a <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the combat is challenging, pulse-pounding, and overall pretty decent. It can get a little disorienting, and I really wish there was more of a "hard" lock-on ability given it's all in third-person and both you and your opponents are constantly zipping around at high speeds. But there are some exciting nuances to master like the various kicks, parries, and telekinetic grabs. At least for a melee build, it could be really exhilarating once I got the hang of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stealth is satisfying and rewarding as well, though it's limited in certain segments like boss fights in a way that can come across as punishing you for deciding to focus on it. Some of the more esoteric fighting styles like Tremere Blood Sorcery are absolutely sick nasty amazing the first few times you pull them off – boiling someone's blood from the inside is every bit as bombastically brutal as you'd imagine – but can come to seem like more of a gimmick than a playstyle after a while. Overall, though, the frantic and action-packed sequences that combined my abilities to use the environment, my movement powers, and even my enemies against each other were some of the high points of Bloodlines 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where it falls down the most, unfortunately, is as an RPG. You are playing as an elder vampire, so it's not exactly a typical zero-to-hero story. But just to give a representative example, the damage your melee attacks do at the very beginning is exactly the same as it will be in the final boss fight. You awaken new powers called Disciplines, like being able to turn invisible or smooch an enemy to turn them to your side, but you'll get all of them for your chosen clan within the first eight hours or so, after which point anything else is mostly a sidegrade. You can upgrade your health track by finding hidden symbols painted in blood across Seattle, but overall there isn't much of a sense of power progression throughout most of the campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The action-packed sequences that combined my abilities were high points.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is further limited by the fact that you can only equip four Disciplines at a time, and only one from each category – so, for example, you can't mix and match two different clans' movement abilities to create your own hyper-mobile playstyle. I don't see the wisdom in these restrictions at all. I also don't really enjoy that each Discipline can only be used once in battle before having to feed again, since they each have their own separate pool of power points, instead of having them draw from a common pool of stored blood that I could spend however I like. Sometimes restrictions are good. I just don't think any of these ones are. I'm a dang vampire. Just let me do what I want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did really appreciate the options Phyre has for visual customization. Each clan has four different outfits to unlock from the punk rock streetwear of the Brujah to the sharp business attire of the Ventrue. NPCs will actually react differently to you based on what you're wearing, such as being easier to seduce if you show a little more skin. That is honestly amazing. But what we're missing is a weapon slot, and that is definitely not amazing. I get that Phyre is an elder and a living weapon herself. She can telekinetically use a gun as a sort of one-off combat consumable, or throw a fire extinguisher across the room. But melee is always a hand-to-hand affair. And again, this is just cramping my style from a character customization angle. Do I need weapons to kill these chumps? Nah. But a vampire with a trenchcoat and dual pistols or a sweet-ass katana is just too cool and iconic to not allow in your vampire RPG. It's part of character creation and self-expression in the tabletop game. What are we doing here?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story about solving a series of dramatic murders and navigating court politics is overall extremely well-written and voiced by a fantastic cast, from the sarcastic Nosferatu Tolly to the self-indulgent queen of seattle herself, Lou Graham. It's so good, in fact, that for the last few hours, I was ready to throw the windows open and start yelling into the night that everyone needed to experience this.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Open World RPGs</h3><p>The best open world RPGs to play in 2025</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But then it absolutely broke my cold, dead heart. <strong>I'll do my best to avoid spoilers here, but you can skip ahead to the verdict if you're really sensitive to that kind of thing</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, every interesting decision I made throughout the entire chronicle was unceremoniously chewed up and spit onto the pavement before being crushed under the uncaring bootheel of anticlimax. All of the machinations I had put into motion, the allies I had made, the chess pieces I had manipulated, all of the <em>awesome vampire elder shit </em>I had been vibrating about in the magnificently inspired lead up to the finale… were resolved in a 30-second epilogue voice-over that completely denied me the real showdown I had been dreaming of all this time. I was devastated. This might be worse than the original ending of Mass Effect 3. It's like they ripped out the last chapter of the book and burned it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the fact that you play maybe about a third of the story through the eyes of the Malkavian film noir detective Fabien, who somehow ended up in Phyre's head. And I love Fabien. I really do. He made me cry at one point. His segments are just as skillfully penned, and give you an interesting look into the history of Seattle. But his mind-altering Malkavian powers, like getting someone to recognize you as a different person or reading their surface thoughts? Cool idea, but every time you are allowed to use them, it is for a railroaded story beat. There is never a point at which they can be combined or deployed in a clever way that would make me feel like <em>I </em>solved the case, which is another huge wasted opportunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the night, this is a story that seems almost annoyed by the fact that it has to offer you any kind of choice at all.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review]]></content:encoded>

For Embark Studios, the test is being undertaken to help the studio prepare its servers for launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone who takes part in the test will get the Server Slammer backpack cosmetic reward when the full game launches on October 30. Progress from the test does not carry forward to the full launch.</p><p>Embark Studios was founded by a team of industry veterans, including former longtime EA and Battlefield executive Patrick Soderlund.

Players venture out into the land above ground to collect resources and fight. Take a look at the trailer above to get a closer look at Arc Raiders.</p><p>Following Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, the shooter space gets another jolt in November when Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches.</a></p>

She explains that doesn't mean shelving major productions and believes there is still plenty of value (both creatively and financially) in greenlighting new entires in truly blockbuster franchises like Call of Duty and God of War because the "payoff is potentially really large."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, she feels those companies with the deepest pockets need to be investing more in smaller titles. "I do also think there is an opportunity for those big players to also look to diversify into double-A and single-A, and then perhaps indie as well right? And what size, shape, or form does that take? I don't know [...] but I think we need to look beyond the knee-jerk reaction of the pandemic and post-pandemic couple of years and really think about who do we want to be? What kind of product do we want to put out? We need to plot out intentionally how we're going to get there," she continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-hires-former-apex-legends-head-of-production-to-lead-31st-union" target="_self" data-discover="true">2K hires former Apex Legends head of production to lead 31st Union</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry&quot;">"I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Referring to recent releases such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Split Fiction</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Morgan Juinio believes there is evidently an appetite and appreciation for titles that eschew big-budget conventions such as life-consuming playtimes and mammoth production cycles.

"What I believe is that we have to make great video games," she adds. "It doesn't matter what shape. I think gamers right now are a little bit desensitized to beautiful graphics and size and scale and scope. It's almost a given, right? If a game isn't fun, it doesn't matter hows pretty it is. If a game isn't engaging or delivering some hook, then it's not going to connect with players."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-metroid-dread-developer-mercurysteamworks-accused-of-retaliation-and-forced-crunch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Metroid Dread developer MercurySteamworks accused of retaliation and forced crunch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Morgan Juinio believes the industry will find a way through the current storm because anybody who chooses to spend their life making video games simply will not accept the current status quo. "I am an eternal glass-half-full type thinker and I think the doom-and-gloom may continue," says Morgan, who understands why the ongoing wave of mass layoffs and investments from questionable entities such as the Saudi-backed Public Investment Fund are raising alarm bells.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also, however, believes there is room for hope.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the very nature of who we are, as developers and creators, won't allow it to stay doom and gloom.

No. I think it's going to be something new. We don't know yet what it is, but I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> players are downright infatuated with one of the more bizarre Mega Evolutions tucked away in the later portion of the game. A Mega Evolution that is making strides in general memery and ridiculous-factor.</p>

<p>That Mega Evolution is of course Mega Starmie, which in Pokémon Legends: Z-A has been given a pair of pointy legs it uses to stroll around the place. It's frankly a silly design, one that many players can't help but scratch their heads at. You can see it for yourself below, but it's literally just Starmie with big purple legs.</p>
<div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>With these legs Mega Starmie has been running around in a peculiar fashion, and that's about it. They don't get any extra gems or a <em>third</em> spinning star on their back. Nope, just legs. It is both incredibly underwhelming and a masterclass in how doing less can sometimes mean doing more. These legs are better eye catchers than the other bells and whistles Pokémon Legends: Z-A has slapped on other Mega Evolutions.</p><p>The reaction to these legs has been coming in droves from members of the Pokémon community, who have wasted no time creating art of Starmie's two strong legs. Some believe Starmie's new form to be menacing, having them sprint directly at the viewer with malicious intent.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>Others, obviously, find Mega Starmie's legs awesome. Some see it as a display of strength, viewing Starmie's legs as bulky pylons on which Mega Starmie asserts its dominance.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>Others see them as appealing in an altogether different way. As shown below, with user Steve Ly on Twitter who interprets Starmie's new legs as sexy boots, and recreating Patrick Star's provocative dance from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCPDVVLUw-4">The Spongebob Squarepants movie's "I'm a Goofy Goober" song</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>Others, I believe with justice in their hearts, feel sorry for Mega Starmie and all the ridicule they have been exposed to. To them, Starmie going out there and expressing themselves was a moment of celebration. The online reaction, a moment of tragedy for the starfish.</p>

<p>Look, whether you are amused, inspired, aroused, or emotionally attached to Mega Starmie's new legs, there's no debate that Starmie has stolen the show in terms of Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolutions. All it took was two legs and a funny run. Perhaps in creating such discussion, Mega Starmie's new look has proven itself a masterpiece in virality, and ultimately a success when it comes to taking a beloved Pokémon to new heights. Literally, new heights.</p>
<p>It also turns out Mega Starmie might poop too, yet another nugget of joy from Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-pokemon-do-poop-legends-z-a-confirms-and-have-tummy-troubles-too">If you want to read more about that, you can of course do so on Eurogamer</a>.</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it has, for the first time, signed a deal with football’s governing body FIFA, and this will have an impact on international management in Football Manager 26 and beyond. This includes adding the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women’s World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup to the game at a later date as part of a international management content update due next year.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, <em>“Revealing this partnership with FIFA is an incredibly historic moment for the studio.Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important. To be able to do that with the support of FIFA with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we’re delighted our fans will be able to experience next year. And this is just the start of our relationship – stay tuned for more to come in 2026 and beyond.”</em></p>


<p>This partnership means in Football Manager 26 all of the teams taking part in the 2026 World Cup will have their official kits in the game. Further details are to follow at a later date about what else this partnership and the international management update will bring when it launches in 2026. Football Manager 26 is due to release on November 4th.</p>

<p>Switch 2 used String Shot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has finally arrived on Switch and Switch 2, but with all the marketing focused on the latter edition, you may well be wondering how TPC's latest fares on Nintendo's old hardware.</p>
<p>Well, the wonderful Felix Sanchez is here to demonstrate. In the above side-by-side comparison video, you can get a glimpse at how Legends: Z-A runs on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, showcasing standard gameplay, cutscenes and load times.</p>
<p>As you'll see, the Switch 2 implements many of the improvements that we'd expect. The 60fps boost is a welcome sight compared to the last gen's 30, resolution and texturing are vastly improved, and a lot of the load times have moved in the right direction — though not <em>all</em> of them, as the video shows.</p>
<p>That said, the Switch 1 side of things looks... surprisingly <em>fine</em>. It's certainly a lot choppier and slower than the Switch 2 edition (as you'd expect), but at least it looks reasonably stable. It's no <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a>, of course, but nobody was really anticipating that, were they?</p>

            <p>The Galaxies Showcase games show – which, if you missed the Spring edition, is a game reveal showcase with more of an indie/lower-budget focus – is back next Thursday, October 23rd.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Full disclosure: RPS, along with fellow Gamer Networkers Eurogamer and VG247, have been deemed 'Galaxies media partners', which I understand to basically mean you can watch the livestream on the homepage. Also full disclosure, nobody said I <em>couldn’t </em>spend this post being hyperfixated on confirmed Galaxies-featured game and wonderfully batshit train stuntfest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack</a>, my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">personal most-craved</a> unreleased creative work currently in existence. Denshattack! It’s got what kickflipping rail conductors crave. Galaxies will also show off some non-Denshattack games, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, old-timey cartoon FPS Mouse: PI For Hire, band management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockbeasts-is-about-managing-an-animal-band-in-a-bojack-style-world-but-itll-need-to-do-more-than-horse-around">Rockbeasts</a>, and boomer shooter sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, among dozens of others.</p> <figure>

<p>There’ll also be as-yet mysterious announcements and reveals from the likes of Devolver Digital, Turnbound devs 1TK, sim specialists Excalibur Games, and Code Coven, an academy for marginalised game dev talent. Kepler Interactive will also have a new look tabeltoppish RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-is-getting-a-sequel-starring-baldurs-gate-3s-narrator">Solasta II</a>, with Team17 adding a few games including the Twin Peaks-inspired survival horror Silver Pines. I hear from my sources that Denshattack, which looks rad, may be involved as well. Denshattack.</p>
<p>Galaxies goes live on <strong>October 23rd at 8pm GMT/ 9pm CEST / 12pm PST / 3pm EST</strong>. Watching it will be easy enough, as you can simply just visit RPS, where again, it’ll be beamed onto our homepage. Much like that Gamescom stream was back in August, except this time we’ll be expecting it, so Edwin won’t go to the tech department and get it removed in a panic. Alternatively, it’s going out on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GalaxiesShow">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/new/news/twitch.tv/galaxiesshow">Twitch</a>.</p>

              <p>I can’t think of a better pair of brands than Minecraft and LEGO. Minecraft is already comprised of individual blocks so it doesn’t take that much of a stretch of the imagination to adapt the world and it’s inhabitants into LEGO brick form. The two have collaborated, bringing us a whole slew of LEGO Minecraft sets including this one based on the Badlands biome which happens to be on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/"> It normally goes for $60, but the discount has it for 27% off for a limited time</a>. That shaves the price down by $17 so you only have to pay $44.</p>
<p>Minecraft has already been sitting comfortably towards the top of the list of the most popular video games of all time. Following the movie this year starring Jack Black, the name has been launched into the stratosphere. So if you’re an aunt or uncle, looking to find a gift this holiday season for a video game-obsessed niece or nephew, chances are they know what a Chicken Jockey is and they’d be more than delighted to receive a LEGO Minecraft set.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play and Creativity Set</h2>
<p>The buildable Minecraft set includes a number of minifigures including a Badlands Explorer, a Creeper, cave spiders, a husk, a baby rabbit, a donkey with saddlebags, 2 slimes and a bat. The bat can even hang upside down with its wings folded up. the people-shaped minifigures are kind of genius in their implementation here to achieve the Minecraft look. They use the standard LEGO torso and legs, but then swap out the head for a box. It’s perfect.</p>



<p>The 538-piece LEGO set has interactive elements. You can blast stones across your play area with the TNT to operate the explode function. The set is filled with tools like the coveted diamond pickaxe. You load load up your different tools into the donkey’s satchel too. Your Minecraft explorer has a bed to sleep in and a set of rails to ride in a minecart down. There are different colored bricks representing precious ores like copper, gold, redstone, and amethyst crystals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/">The LEGO Minecraft The Badlands Mineshaft set is only one part of a much larger collection.</a> You can also shop for LEGO versions of a pirate ship voyage, a cherry blossom garden, a wolf stronghold, a windmill farm, as well as the ender dragon and end ship. Right now, the Badlands Mineshaft set is on sale for its lowest price on Amazon yet. That’s just $43, down from $60.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marvel Rivals</i> is shedding its PvP-only identity this October with a PvE mode in which you and your friends&nbsp; are gonna have to use super powers to mop up a zombie-infested city. The event kicks off later this month as a collaboration with Marvel Animation following the four-episode <i>Marvel Zombies</i> miniseries on Disney+.</p> <p>Developer NetEase shared the news of its upcoming PvE zombies mode this morning <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847">over on X</a> with a post showing off some fun animation and a slice of the gameplay, as well as a few details of how it’ll work. Though you won’t have access to the full roster of heroes available in PvP, you can choose among Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Shark, and the Punisher to sweep through zombie hordes and take on Zombie Namoor and the Queen of the Dead, who serve as bosses. It all launches on October 23, 2025, just in time for Halloween.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first-ever PvE mode: Marvel Zombies is coming on Oct 23, 2025 UTC. </p> <p>This new mode throws you and your squad into a relentless fight for survival against endless waves of the undead. </p> <p>The city's burning, the infected are rising – and it's up to you to hold the line. <br>Get a… <a href="https://t.co/DodsnAzoRB">pic.twitter.com/DodsnAzoRB</a></p> <p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>These heroes will work a little differently from how they do in the base game, too. Thor, for example, is described in the teaser as having a “persistent awakened state” and Magik has access to an “unlimited Darkchild form.”</p>

 <h2><i>Marvel Rivals</i> could use a Hail Mary</h2> <p>The news follows a pretty significant dip in popularity for the superhero-themed hero shooter. As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/12/marvel-rivals-has-lost-85-of-its-players-in-10-months/">reported by <i>Forbes</i>’ Paul Tassi</a>, the once white-hot shooter has cooled, losing 85 percent of the player base it enjoyed earlier in the year. As Tassi notes, the player count is still quite healthy, with concurrents peaking at 98,000 in recent days. But clearly Marvel Studios could use a bit of a shot in the arm if it wants to reclaim its previous numbers, which saw things top out at 644,000 concurrents.</p> <p>Zombies and horde PvE modes are nothing we haven’t seen before in shooters. The upcoming <i>Black Ops 7</i> this November, for example, continues <i>CoD</i>’s long-running zombies mode alongside its standard multiplayer offerings. That said, <i>Rivals</i>’ PvE gameplay does look pretty fresh in motion. We’ll see if it’s enough to put some spring in <i>Rivals</i>’ step.</p>

              <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is having a big week with </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>out now for Switch and Switch 2, but before fans headed back to Kalos, they learned a whole lot about the future of the series after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>a second massive Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span>. The info dump included information about future games, including the Generation X games </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>. If you were wondering about the legitimacy of the whole thing, well, it looks like The Pokémon Company is targeting prominent leakers with DMCA takedowns.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978966734452248960"><span>Centro Leaks</span></a><span>, an X account that compiles </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>leaks when they sprout up in places like 4chan or Discord, claims that TPC COO Takato Utsunomiya has contacted X about multiple copyright infringements from the leaks, saying that these posts include images and videos that have been “reproduced and distributed to the public without [the company’s] permission.” Among the posts listed in the screenshotted email are the </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>logos, and a list of Pokémon supposedly returning in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>Teraleak happened last year</span></a><span>, and included not only information about upcoming projects but also several documents and pieces of concept art for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-budget-canceled-masuda-black-white-remake-2000635371"><span>older games, as well as some canceled ones</span></a><span> that never saw the light of day. Almost exactly a year later, this second wave of information spread, revealing new development footage and design docs for games like </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game set in the Galar region from </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, and an MMO-style game that would take place in multiple regions from previous games. Whether or not these leaks shift plans for any of the games Game Freak has coming down the pipeline remains to be seen, but by trying to take these down, The Pokémon Company may have confirmed their legitimacy. We’ve reached out to the company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p>

Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo added that each playable hero will have a few unique abilities to help even the odds, like Thor having a persistent Awakened state to shock nearby zombies, Magik's Darkchild form, and Jeff's ability to charge through enemies.</p><p>The new mode will roll out to Marvel Rivals on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, arriving roughly a month after the release of the gruesome Marvel Zombies streaming series on Disney+.</p><p>Marvel Rivals recently expanded its roster with a new playable character, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-update-adds-daredevil-and-cross-platform-progression/1100-6535147/">Daredevil</a>.
