            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced yet another&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>delay, and this time, there's no new release date on the horizon, so it's going to be a while before you can play the prison management sim.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Paradox forum</a>, the <i>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</i>dev team says it won't be able to make the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed">previously-announced September release date</a> owing to a need for "time to improve both the game's performance and its content". These two areas were, Paradox says, identified by "continuous internal reviews and beta test groups" as places where the team needed to up its game.</p>
<p>The studio says it's still confident that&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>will be "great", but that it wants to make sure the sequel "lives up to the franchise’s legacy" and that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-double-eleven-leaves">developer Kokku</a> has the time it needs to make the game as good as it can be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely-yard.jpg?itok=MntdLc7y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely-yard.jpg?itok=ELqnfCIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>isn't coming out anytime soon, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Paradox goes on to say that it can't commit to a new release date because it needs to "re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done" before it knows when it will be able to launch&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2</em>. That's also why you won't be hearing much about the game in the near future; the publisher says it'll be limiting its communication in order to knuckle down and work on the game.</p>
<p>If you've pre-ordered <i>Prison Architect 2</i>, then your pre-order will be refunded, and items that would have been offered as part of that pre-order will instead be included in the base game.</p>
<p>The publisher closes its announcement by admitting that this "is not the announcement [it] hoped to make", but that it's "necessary" and that the delay will "result in a better game for you".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Prison Architect 2</i>, it's the upcoming sequel to 2015's successful prison management sim&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect</em>, which was developed by Introversion Software (and then Double Eleven from 2019 onwards).</p>
<p>The second game will bring the management sim gameplay into 3D, allowing you to build prisons with multiple levels, and it'll also introduce a number of other gameplay tweaks and improvements. Of course, now that we don't have a release date, we sadly don't know when you'll be able to enjoy those improvements.</p>
<p><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>is set for launch sometime in the future on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4139-PPSA14957_00-PRISONARCHITECT2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/prison-architect-2/9NF6CP5B3J18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Will it be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled like&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em></a>? Only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-form-new-team-under-blizzard-for-smaller-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip">new report</a> by Jez Corden via Windows Central, Microsoft and Activision have created a new team within Blizzard designed to work on smaller games.</p>



<p>The team’s work will reportedly involve “AA games based on existing Blizzard franchises like Overwatch, Warcraft, StarCraft, and beyond.” </p>



<p>Fans recently noticed that veteran King employees are updating their LinkedIn profiles to mention Blizzard instead. </p>



<p>Now, Corden cites sources claiming that the new team under Blizzard will be “comprised mostly with employees from King.” It is currently unclear which other employees outside King could join the new team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Corden speculates on the team’s potential direction based on King’s previous mobile experience. The new Blizzard team could possibly support Xbox’s mobile plans. </p>



<p>Corden does point out that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently referenced a related plan for Xbox. However, at this time, the studios did not officially elaborate on the new team or its future projects. </p>



<p>There’s plenty of available IP that the new team could work with across platforms, such as the beloved Diablo series, or even Hearthstone. Although Blizzard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzcon-2024-canceled-by-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled BlizzCon</a> this year, a new dedicated team may please fans.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1819360783811117168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Corden added that “Microsoft wants its Xbox studios to collaborate more closely and support each other,” similar to Nintendo and Blizzard operations. </p>



<p>In February 2024, Activision and Blizzard titles began joining the Xbox Game Pass, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-iv-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginning with Diablo IV</a>. </p>

From balancing creative visions with technical constraints, to managing employee well-being, the obstacles are diverse and each significant to the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Studio Head responsible for running and growing Larian Studios in the UK, I have encountered many such situations that had to be dealt with in order to consistently achieve our goal which is delivering best-in-class RPGs. In this article, I’d like to describe a global studio presence framework that we have adapted and demonstrate how this strategic approach can provide solutions, drawing on insights from the industry. It’s partially thanks to this approach that we managed to achieve the release and ultimately win over 150 awards and nominations with Divinity: Original Sin, before going even further with Baldur's Gate 3, which launched to critical acclaim and received multiple Game Of The Year awards, including major trophies from the BAFTA Game Awards, Golden Joysticks, Game Developers Choice, DICE, and The Game Awards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These achievements required a distinct strategy and vision. But before we get into that, let's have a look at the challenges.</span></p><p>Source: Photo by Jeshoots on Pexels</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Challenges">The Challenges</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility"><span>1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The boundless power of creativity is what drives the industry. But adapting it to technical constraints and building a robust internal company infrastructure is one of the main challenges in games development. It often happens that game studios come up with the most exciting ideas as they push the boundaries of modern technical tools, but that’s of no use if the project isn’t released on time or at all. And then there’s the constant challenge to ensure that creative visions can be manifested within the limits of existing hardware and engines without compromising the original vision or the final gameplay experience.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow"><span>2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In recent years we’ve seen the games industry produce some exciting masterpieces. With every new iteration, studios strive to outdo themselves in terms of not only artistic skills, but technical ones too. The workflows are becoming more and more intricate to allow for constant iteration while pushing the bar of the industry higher and higher. It’s quite a challenging task to manage a scalable workflow that can handle large assets, numerous iterations, and multiple teams (often spread across different locations and time zones). To set yourself up for success you need to know the collaboration within your teams is as streamlined as can be, and that there’s clear communication and alignment on your goals. This is mainly achieved through meticulous production management and the choice of technological and development tools.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes"><span>3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pace at which new technical solutions come around in the gaming industry (things like VR, AR, and cloud gaming have been mainly adopted on a larger scale in the last few years) means that studios have to continuously learn and adapt. Integrating these and other solutions into your game development pipeline can require a lot of extra resources and can present additional risks, however it’s often necessary to keep up with the competition or breathe life into new exciting ideas.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Maintaining Employee Work/Life Balance"><span>4. Maintaining Employee Work/Life Balance</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s important to maintain focus on a healthy employee’s work/life balance as not doing it will almost certainly lead to team burnouts, affect developers mental health, ultimately reduce productivity in the long term, and even result in high staff turnover over time. These factors can compromise releasing the game altogether or maintaining the vision set at the beginning of the development cycle. Changing these things that have been around for decades for the better appears to be a significant challenge these days.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Ensuring Financial Viability"><span>5. Ensuring Financial Viability</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game development is volatile by nature due to being expensive and risky at the same time. Studios have to secure enough funding and longer-term support to even have a shot at making their dream game, which can be difficult without a proven track record of past successes. Additionally, you need to be able to predict market trends and gamer preferences - often years in advance - to aim for a successful release. This adds one more layer of difficulty to the mix.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction">6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With thousands of games released every year, the task of maintaining player engagement is becoming more and more challenging. It’s not enough for studios to deliver innovative and high-quality games anymore as they also need to manage post-launch support through content updates and bug fixes while keeping the community excited to retain and increase the playerbase. This requires constantly allocating resources towards it and can be somewhat as demanding as the initial development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Framework">The Framework</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea behind our framework and its implementation involves maintaining a presence in the form of game studios in specific countries for multiple strategic reasons. From acting as talent hubs to beneficial time zone overlaps, this approach might solve more issues than one would think. But here’s just a few reasons why we do it this way:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Talent Hub:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Each location is now a hub for talents in the region. People are generally much more inclined to work in a studio in their own country or a neighbouring one than move across the world, giving us a competitive advantage on finding and retaining the talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time Zone Overlap: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Having studios in multiple regions allows their time zones and work days to overlap. This is useful for a few reasons:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is always someone online within the team in their regular work hours, ready to offer advice, jump a call, or generally discuss something in their field of work..</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Healthier work/life balance as the company operates globally yet within reasonable working hours in each region.

In our case this looks something like this, however this is a work in progress that may change over time depending on multiple factors at play:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Quebec, Canada (GMT-6)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Audio, Environment Art, Gameplay Animation, Gameplay Code, Gameplay QA, Production, Scripting, Tech Animation, VFX</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guildford, UK (GMT +0)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Audio, Cinematic Animation, Production, Publishing, Scripting, Tools &amp; R&amp;D, UI/UX Design, Voice &amp; Performance, Writing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dublin, Ireland (GMT +0)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Cinematic Art, Cinematic Animation, Lighting, Localisation, Publishing, Recruitment, Scripting, VFX, Writing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warsaw, Poland (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Tech, Production</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghent, Belgium (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Gameplay Animation, Gameplay Code, Engine Code, Character Art, Concept Art, Design, Environment Art, Scripting, Tech Art, Tech Animation, World Building</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barcelona, Spain (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Console Code, Character Art, Design, Engine Code, Gameplay Code, Production, Scripting, Tech QA</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (GMT+7)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Automation QA, Cinematic Art, Cinematic Animation, Concept Art, Gameplay Animation, Gameplay QA, Scripting</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How it can help">How it can help</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility"><span>1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The wider your reach is, the more diverse tech expertise and resources you and your studio have access to. By having multiple studios across different regions you use a more distributed approach, inviting diversity in technological capabilities and creative inputs that can help in solving complex problems. For example, one studio might have a better grasp at cutting-edge rendering techniques, while another can easily amass writing talent. Together, these studios can both do what they are great at and combine forces, pushing both creative and technical boundaries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By having a prominent global presence, a studio has access to a wider pool of talent, which makes it much easier to get experts in specific areas. It allows you to assign major specialisations to different locations based on their strengths and team composition. A studio in a region known for its capable engineering universities can focus on technical development like engine code, while the other one known for artistic schools could specialise in 2D/3D Art - as a broad example.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow"><span>2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that the process continues and the workflow never stops - on a global scale - is a big benefit to production deadlines. The operations being continuous across time zones allows for a "follow-the-sun" model where tasks are passed along across the globe, effectively utilising the so-called 24-hour work cycle of a distributed company. This setup minimises downtimes and can even enhance how responsive the studios are to development needs, one studio being able to pick up a project where another one left off. It keeps things moving forward and also allows for more predictable scheduling while reducing the pressure on the team, bringing you to more efficient and scalable workflows. This approach ensures that workloads in a given studio are way more balanced.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes"><span>3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technological progress is constantly breathing down your neck, and yet you may see how different regions are adopting new tech at different speeds due to various reasons like legislation or global penetration of tech solutions. Having studios spread across the world can accelerate access to tech insights as this structure fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, which is very important for staying ahead in a quickly evolving industry such as video games. Cross-pollination of ideas is mandatory for staying at the forefront of advancements in tech these days.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Retaining Talent"><span>4. Retaining Talent</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the team distributed globally, the workload can be more evenly distributed even given time constraints and a sizable backlog of things to do. It allows you to maintain a healthy work/life balance in your teams as much as possible even towards the final stages of development whilst managing deadlines more efficiently. Transferring tasks across studios to balance the workload and to maintain regular working hours as much as possible and where possible can aid in promoting a much better culture at work as opposed to just single location teams. This in turn leads to a better retaining of talent as at the end of the day (or at the end of your whole development cycle) it facilitates improved employee satisfaction, reduces burnouts and generally keeps your studios a great place to work at, fostering loyalty and keeping things organised with a focus on well-being.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Ensuring Financial Viability"><span>5. Ensuring Financial Viability</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The global presence also allows for a certain degree of risk diversification. If one market or project (in case you do multiple projects with such a structure) does not perform as you expect it to, others might compensate. If there’s a certain crisis or something out of the ordinary in a given region, normally others provide a bit more stability and predictability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, being present in multiple regions can increase your brand recognition and open up various funding opportunities with local accelerators or government bodies, such as being nominated for regional grants and various incentives not available to studios operating in a single country. This approach may also help in tapping into local player bases better and more effectively, tailoring content to regional preferences, and potentially increasing your overall revenue stream.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction"><span>6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple studios around the world mean closer proximity to your players also spread across the world, enabling a better and more tailored market research and integration of diverse feedback into the development process. This produces culturally relevant and diverse content, increasing player satisfaction and engagement with your game. Post-launch support can be then handled in a more timezone-friendly manner too, because you can now give players faster responses and updates when it’s best to do so.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making the Dream Come True">Making the Dream Come True</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you can see, there are few things keeping your game studio becoming the best it can be. But international presence, while tough to master, can be a major step-up in your operations. Once you realise the importance of having a robust and adaptive framework and implement a similar structure into your operational approach, your workflow will become unmatched. I hope that this article serves as a starting guide to one of many ways of extracting the full potential of your studio.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following&nbsp;<span>Bungie's layoff&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a></span>, several insiders have provided updates on their projects, starting with Destiny 3. <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737?t=Dc_izmLcLnoQhituMYpJuw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, sources inside Bungie confirmed that Destiny 3 was actually never in development, despite earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> to the contrary. The studio experimented with a spin-off project codenamed Payback for a while, but it was eventually shelved before the latest round of layoffs.</p>
<p>Bungie will instead continue to support Destiny 2, but according to another insider, Jeff Grubb, it will do so in a different fashion. During Grubb's Game Mess Mornings, the insider also confirmed the departure of major figures like Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy:</p>
<p><em>This other project, called Payback, was being overseen by Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy. This new thing was going to be the new Destiny experience, the next big thing for Destiny, but specifically not Destiny 3. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy are no longer at Bungie; they were let go. Payback is on the shelf and the strategy now is, let's take Destiny 2 and we're going to make smaller experience packs, smaller, tinier, little things that are 6 months instead of the annual expansion packs they've done before. There'll be two smaller experience packs going forward.</em></p>
<p>This strategy change was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ehvju3/a_credible_destiny_2_leaker_reveals_new_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by another Destiny leaker, who said there will be 2 DLCs and two seasons per year with a seasonal narrative, a seasonal loop, and two rally events.</p>
<p>According to Jeff Grubb, Bungie will also be essentially run by PlayStation Studios Head Hermen Hulst, losing its previously recognized autonomy following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition</a> by Sony.</p>
<p><em>The process is beginning to&nbsp;basically remove their autonomy. They will no longer operate as an independent studio under Sony; they will be like any other PlayStation worldwide studio under Sony Interactive Entertainment, with Herman Hulst overseeing the studio like he does the rest of Sony studios.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Destiny 2 support, Bungie remains focused on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marathon</a> reboot as a competitive extraction shooter and a third franchise, which will be developed alongside PlayStation Studios.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fields-of-mistria-review-next-best-cozy-farming-sim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fields-of-mistria-review-the-next-best-cozy-farming-sim.943008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fields-of-mistria-review-next-best-cozy-farming-sim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a world of oversaturated farming sim games, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> stands out like a light at the end of a tunnel. With beautiful art, incredible writing, and near-perfect mechanics, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> feels like a classic in the making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning, the player is recruited to work on a farm in Mistria for free. All they have to do is help build the town back up, which was wrecked after an earthquake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gameplay mechanics are very similar to other farming sims – players farm, take care of animals, fish, mine, and build relationships. There’s also a bit of combat in <em>Fields of Mistria</em>, and increasing the town’s rank is necessary to progress part of the story.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teamwork-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=9aLU-R84 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teamwork-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=Xw-_9Z17 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At every step in the story, the townspeople are ready to jump in and help.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fields of Mistria</em> has a robust story to it. The land itself used to be full of magic, but it disappeared. Part of the player’s job is to rediscover magic, using the power of the dragons. Players can learn spells as they progress, setting it apart from your average farming sim.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Fields of Mistria</em> perfects the little things</h2>
<p>While the gameplay loops are nothing too new, everything feels fantastic. The animations for watering, tilling, and sowing seeds are crystal clear and cute, and this idea applies to everything in the game. The animations of everything from walking to swimming are well done and stand out. Even the sounds accompanying all of these are really good.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/coming-to-mistria-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=1lS4x53K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/coming-to-mistria-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=TEW6KV-O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From the start,&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>sets itself up with an interesting story.</figcaption></figure><p>This attention to detail permeates through every other aspect of gameplay, too. The prices and requirements for quests and progressing the story are well-balanced, which is something that can be tricky. <em>Fields of Mistria</em> doesn’t feel too hard or too easy, instead striking a good balance of being challenging without being frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mistria itself is very much alive</h2>
<p>Characters are another well-crafted part of <em>Fields of Mistria</em>. With a diverse cast of people in the town of Mistria, making them all stand out isn’t easy. However, they all do, and they all feel genuine at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large part of this is because of how they interact together and with the player. If two or more characters are standing together, then they’re going to be having a conversation you can listen to. The characters react to things the player does and will reference things other characters in the town have done, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They’re so interconnected, and there’s an abundance of dialogue that never feels wasted. Everything each character says has weight to it, and I never saw reused dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters never waste an opportunity to get together, either. One of my favorite parts of the game was getting together with everyone on Friday nights to celebrate the weekend. Every Friday, people would be paired up and doing something as a group, giving their relationships more meaning. While some characters were playing a tabletop RPG, others were drinking at the bar. Meanwhile, the trio of mischievous kids are up to no good around the corner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=PsZAalMn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=Jafyrmn4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The only bad thing about the tabletop RPG was that I couldn't join in the campaign.</figcaption></figure><p>Plus, these interactions change with the seasons. People start to do different things, like creating an art club or starting new campaigns in their TTRPG. They change their outfits, their hairstyles, and their habits to fit the world around them.</p>
<p>These little parts of <em>Fields of Mistria</em> went such a long way in building Mistria, and it’s something that no other farming simulator, cozy or not, has really pushed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The aesthetic of <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is the cherry on top</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rain-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=M_eUqZ3v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rain-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=qv1YGztD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even the rain in&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>looked and sounded great.<br>
&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fields of Mistria</em> is gorgeous, there’s no doubt about it. It may be too cutesy for some folks on the surface, but it’s got more depth than that after the first thirty minutes of playtime. This applies to the characters themselves too, from their portraits to their actual sprites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music in Mistria is another good point. It actually feels like you’re walking through an idyllic village in an RPG constantly, and it works well. Mistria has an undercurrent of magic and fantasy to it, and the music captures that well. The only problem I had with the music was that it would cut out randomly and then start again. This wasn’t a major problem, and an update right before the embargo seemed to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another problem that was seemingly fixed by the last-minute update was lagging problems. Occasionally, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> would slow down and also crashed once on me. Again, this problem never happened after the update, but it was present in the early hours of my experience.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Overall, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is one of the best farming sims in some time</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/calendar-days-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=gcCLyRsx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/calendar-days-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=l5EPMRkq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The beginning of every day also included event information that the calendar doesn't, a helpful tool for planning the day.</figcaption></figure><p>Cozy farming sims have blown up since the release of <em>Stardew Valley</em> back in 2016. While the game still has a very active player base, many people are always looking for the next big thing. <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is perfectly set to take that stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s easy to tell that developers wanted to perfect every little thing about the game, and it’s paid off. Everything about <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is taken to the next level, perfecting every aspect of the cozy farming sim genre. There's an endless amount of great things to say about&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>, but I'll let you discover some of it for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/until-dawn-video-game-adaptation-maia-mitchell-peter-stormare-1235964505/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> by The Hollywood Reporter, the Until Dawn movie adaptation has added new cast members including the return of Peter Stormare.</p>



<p>Stormare is a popular actor with over 200 credits, appearing in classic movies like Fargo. They also entered gaming with the Destiny series, playing Arach Jalaal. They played the iconic Dr. Hill in Supermassive Games’ original Until Dawn from 2015. </p>



<p>THR’s new report claims that “insiders say that in a callback to the game, Stormare is reprising his role of therapist Dr. Hill.” However, at this time, the studios did not officially confirm the roles of the new cast members.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In addition to Peter Stormare, other new cast members now reportedly include Maia Mitchell and Belmont Cameli. Fans may recognize Mitchell from The Fosters, and Cameli from the recent iteration of Saved by the Bell.</p>



<p>The Hollywood Reporter previously revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn’s movie adaptation</a> in January 2024. </p>



<p>David F. Sandberg, the director of Shazam, Lights Out, and Annabelle: Creation, is attached to direct Until Dawn. Screen Gems and PlayStation Productions partnered for the adaptation.</p>



<p>Stormare’s return in particular should build some buzz, and it may open the door for other original Until Dawn cast members to return in some way. </p>



<p>On the gaming side, Until Dawn’s anticipated new version from Ballistic Moon just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an ESRB rating</a> this week. The rebuilt version is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 in Fall 2024.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Nintendo said sales during the same quarter last year were "extremely high" due to those factors. For this year, however, "there were no such special factors in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and with Nintendo Switch now in its eighth year since launch, unit sales of both hardware and software decreased significantly year-on-year," Nintendo said.</p><p>Of the 2.1 million Switch consoles sold in the latest quarter, the majority (1.24 million) came from the OLED model, with the standard Switch (530,000 units) and Switch Lite (330,000 units) making up the rest.</p><p>Nintendo said it is forecasting to sell 13.5 million Switch consoles during its current fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2025. With 2.1 million sold already this fiscal year, that leaves 11.4 million to go to reach the target. If Nintendo can achieve that, then Switch sales would reach 154.4 million--just 600,000 shy of the PS2's estimated record of 155 million.</p><p>In terms of game sales, 30.64 million games were sold for Switch in the quarter, which was down by 41.3% compared to the 52.21 million sold during the same period last year. Again, though, it's important to note <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-sold-over-10-million-copies-in-first-three-days/1100-6514264/" data-ref-id="1100-6514264">how massive Tears of the Kingdom was</a>--Nintendo was always going to struggle to have a favorable year-over-year comparison.</p><p>Nintendo did have some new releases during the quarter, including Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (1.76 million units) and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD (1.19 million units), which Nintendo said had a "good start." As of June 30, more than 1.26 billion games have been sold for Switch.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo has a number of titles on the schedule, including Emio - The Smiling Man (August 20, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (September 26), Super Mario Party Jamboree (October 17), Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership (November 7), and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (January 16, 2025).</p><p>Fans are also eagerly awaiting the announcement and release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo calls its next console.

            <p>The upcoming movie adaptation of Supermassive's horror Until Dawn sees Peter Stormare reprise his role from the game, psychiatrist Dr Hill.</p>
<p>Whilst it remains unclear how, exactly, the movie will account for the game's myriad of deaths, survivals, and endings, Stormare's casting at least hints that Supermassive's trademark player "guide" will be making an appearance.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/until-dawn-video-game-adaptation-maia-mitchell-peter-stormare-1235964505/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Stormare will be joined by Maia Mitchell and Belmont Cameli, although what roles they'll play remains under wraps for now.</p>
<p>THR says Stormare is a veteran actor with "hundreds of credits to his name", including Fargo and Prison Break. You may also recognise him from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.</p>
<p>We learned that Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn was being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation earlier this year. It's described as a "R-rated love letter to the horror genre", suggesting it'll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Supermassive Games' narrative-focused single-player Dead by Daylight spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-studios-narrative-dead-by-daylight-spin-off-the-casting-of-frank-stone-out-in-september">The Casting of Frank Stone, launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 3rd September</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s been a lovely, sunny week, and that’s meant that I’ve actually been outdoors, collecting Vitamin D to see me through the dark days (as in, the normal UK weather when you live up North). I have, however, played a chunk of Overwatch 2, loads of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/f1-manager-24-review/">F1 Manager 24</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Cataclismo, and some more Elder Scrolls Online: The Gold Road, which is, unsurprisingly, something of a time sink.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, as per, and the very funny <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/thank-goodness-youre-here-review/">Thank Goodness You’re Here</a> for review. Oh sure, it it doesn’t sound like much of a game, it sounds like I’m going to chortle my way through it, so I’m sold!</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been dipping his toe (paw?) back into MTG Arena with the release of its cutest set, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/mtg-arena-bloomburrow-expansion-starters-guide/">Bloomburrow</a>. Beyond that, it’s the usual: Monster Hunter Now!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/deadlink-review/">Deadlink for review</a>, saying, “It’s a fun roguelike arena shooter with a banging soundtrack.” He’s also been heading back in time though, “I’ve also played more Enslaved Odyssey to the West. I’m nearly at the end of the main story and then I’ll start the DLC.”</p>


<p>Chanting “EDF! EDF!” in his sleep has been Ade, who said in his waking hours that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/earth-defense-force-6-review/">EDF 6</a> “is everything an Earth Defense Force fan could ever wish for.” He’s also been playing Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and seriously enjoying it. He says, “It’s the kind of creative and unique experimental game that I thought major publishers (other than Nintendo) just didn’t make any more. I’m so glad Capcom proved me wrong though, as Kunitsu-Gami is an absolute gem and proving to be one of my favourite games of the year so far.”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing some Zenless Zone Zero, some Frontier Hunter, and Shadow Tower Abyss on the PS2! From Software’s weirdest and coolest pre-Souls game. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Elden Ring, yet more Baldur’s Gate 3, and Mount and Blade Bannerlord, but the bigger challenge has been playing a game of telephone, trying to convince someone, anyone to come and install internet. Hopefully a chap will come along to sort that out today.</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> handed in his review for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/01/steamworld-heist-2-review/">SteamWorld Heist 2</a>, and had a whale of a time with crew of submariner Steambots, taking on the game’s distinctive side-scrolling turn-based action. He’s also been out and about playing a much anticipated game… but sadly can’t tell us anything about that until later this month.</p>
<p>But what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211410/humble-games-layoffs-indie-studios-uncertainty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humble Games “restructured” and reportedly laid off its 36-person team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204641/beloved-indie-game-publisher-humble-games-has-reportedly-laid-off-all-staff-without-warning">last week</a>. The publisher, which is part of the IGN-owned Humble Bundle, started helping developers release games <a href="https://developer.humblebundle.com/post/157036461841/humble-bundle-launches-multi-platform-publishing">in 2017</a> and published notable games like <em>Slay the Spire</em> and <em>Signalis</em>. The resulting fallout from the layoffs has left developers working with the publisher uncertain about many plans for future games, leaving their console ports in jeopardy.</p><p>Amir Fassihi, studio director of Dead Mage, the team behind the in-development <em>Wizard of Legend 2,</em> is worried that the restructuring could impact their project. “We do not want to make any changes,” Fassihi tells <em>The Verge</em>. “However, we’re unsure what changes will be forced on us because everyone in the publisher we collaborated with in the past 2.5 years is suddenly gone.” Now, Dead Mage has to “wait and hope that the new team will deliver the various publishing services that we expected from Humble Games.”</p><p>The “new team,” <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">according to a report from <em>Aftermath</em></a> and three of the developers I spoke with, is the Powell Group, <a href="https://powellgroupconsulting.com/services/">a video game consulting company</a>. The Powell Group and Humble Games didn’t reply to requests for comment. In a post <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772">last week</a>, Humble Games didn’t mention the Powell Group’s involvement, only saying that “supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority” and that “we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Coral Island.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Stairway Games</cite></p></div><p>Developers are mostly worried about console ports, which Humble Games seemed to have a major hand in for some of the projects it worked on.</p><p>“We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both porting and QA support was tied into our deal with Humble,” Squid Shock Studios, developer of the newly released <em>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</em>, <a href="https://x.com/SquidShock/status/1817973044826226968">said in a post on Monday</a>. (The game is available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch in addition to Steam.) “We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place.” The studio is also planning to <a href="https://x.com/SquidShock/status/1818295470034456578">launch a Patreon</a>.</p><p><em>Coral Island</em> developer Stairway Games <a href="https://x.com/coralislandgame/status/1816674043954925590">said last week</a> that the impact of the restructuring “remains uncertain for all things related to consoles.” The game is out on Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 5, and Steam, with a Switch port in the works. The team has a hotfix for its 1.1 update “nearing release” on Steam, but “we have no idea how to get this update out to other platform players as we don’t have the backend permission on console platforms to push updates out,” Stairway said. “We only have access to the Steam backend.” Stairway is offering Kickstarter backers who are still waiting for the Switch release <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game/posts/4158875">the option</a> to get a Steam key instead.</p><div><p>“Changing publishers would be an extremely uphill battle”</p></div><p>Even if developers wanted to make a change from Humble Games as a result of the restructuring, that might be difficult. “To the best of my understanding, Humble Games is fulfilling their contractual obligations to us, so changing publishers would be an extremely uphill battle,” says Matthew Taylor of <em>Rolling Hills</em> developer Catch &amp; Release.</p><p>Not every studio appears to have been significantly impacted, and things do seem to be improving for developers since the restructuring. Cody Greenhalge, technical director at <em>#Blud</em> developer Exit 73 Studios, tells <em>The Verge</em> that the Powell Group has “worked well with us and we are hopeful our game won’t have any long lasting effects from this ordeal.”</p><p>Taylor says that the Powell Group has set Catch &amp; Release up with a new release manager, producer, and back catalog specialist. “It’s still too early to know how efficiently all these new folks can work together and get onboarded quickly, but in the case of our game we only need someone to help us get new updates to Microsoft and manage discounts and events, so I think we’ll be OK,” Taylor says. “If we were working on a game still in development or having very recently released, I’d be way more stressed.”</p><p>Despite the uncertainties, Humble Games spokesperson Michael Brown said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24210726/humble-games-console-ports-layoffs">to <em>Polygon</em></a> that “nothing has changed and no developers have had to change their porting plans; every project is moving ahead.” Brown added that “when people see that the new team at Humble Games was brought in to improve operations and support levels for all the developers, all concerns will be laid to rest.”&nbsp;</p><p>Even if things are slowly improving, the situation has been messy, leaving developers unsure of how they’ll move forward with their games. “The layoff of the whole Humble team has been the strangest thing I have seen in my 20 years of experience working,” says Fassihi. “The fact that nothing was shared with us beforehand, and we had to read this in the news, makes it even worse.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the news of significant layoffs at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bungie">Bungie</a> earlier this week, there’s been a lot of further reporting on what this means for the company’s future and how they’ve ended up in this place. Senior staff have left, a new Destiny game has reportedly been cancelled, and many have called for CEO Pete Parsons to quit for mismanaging the company over the last few years.</p>
<p>The layoffs were announced on Wednesday by Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, with 220 of the company’s 1300 headcount losing their jobs, while a further 155 would be able to move across to the wider PlayStation business, and <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1818674500013097178">around 40 to form a new studio</a> and take on an incubation project. That’s roughly a third of the company’s workforce, and follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">100 employees losing their jobs last October</a>, leaving the new headcount at around 850 employees.</p>
<p>As part of this, it’s reported that key Bungie figures from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2’s</a> early revival have departed the company. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy have apparently left (per Jeff Grubb’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y&amp;ab_channel=JeffGrubb%27sGameMess" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Mess Decides podcast</a>) following the cancellation of their Destiny spin-off game, codenamed Payback. This had been reported as being Destiny 3, but as is often the case, further details are leaked once people are no longer employed, and <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier’s sources state it was not a direct</a> sequel, and actually cancelled some time ago.</p>


<p>The layoffs have been met with a lot of shock from outside viewers, given the very positive reception of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>. Bungie had delayed the expansion’s release in an effort to come back from failing to meet financial expectations with the previous year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/14/destiny-2-lightfall-review/">Lightfall</a>, and by all accounts, The Final Shape was the narrative finale that Destiny needed and deserved.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the">Stephen Totilo reports</a> that the deep job cuts were planned to happen regardless of the reception or success of The Final Shape. The need for job cuts was only made worse by The Final Shape having “sold less than Lightfall”, despite its positive reception. As Parsons stated in the job cuts announcement, “We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red.”</p>

<p>Since that announcement, a lot of anger has been directed at Parsons personally for his decision making, leadership and level of accountability. Parsons claimed that the leadership team “did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome,” but there have been various former employees calling for Parsons to quit, especially with anecdotes about him <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSamBartley/status/1818678522397049082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1818678522397049082%7Ctwgr%5E5c982966ceb610db0c23f156764e420a0aec9131%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F104075-bungie-ceo-faces-backlash-after-announcing-220-people.html">inviting them to view his personal car collection</a> – a collection that has been found on car bidding site <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/">Bring A Trailer</a>, and which shows a total value of $2.4 million, over <a href="https://twitter.com/D2cbro/status/1818700972660576660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1818700972660576660%7Ctwgr%5E5c982966ceb610db0c23f156764e420a0aec9131%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F104075-bungie-ceo-faces-backlash-after-announcing-220-people.html">$450,000 of which came since October 2023,</a> the time of the first wave of layoffs.</p>
<p>Anyone else remember <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/07/29/nintendo-president-takes-50-pay-cut/">the time that Nintendo’s President took a 50% pay cut?</a></p>
<p>There’s also analysis of how this ties back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/31/sony-buys-bungie-halo-destiny-2-ps5/">Sony’s 2022 acquisition of Bungie for $3.6 billion</a>. Speaking to Totilo, an anonymous former Bungie insider said, “I think Sony overpaid for Bungie. I think Bungie sold things they were just not able to deliver.” The company had seemingly overstated their earning potential, while courting Sony as a buyer.</p>
<p>And Parsons is again going to be in the spotlight for that, as part of the 2022 acquisition was that Bungie would remain autonomous. That autonomy reportedly came into threat last year as Bungie started to miss financial targets, which was seemingly a driving factor behind layoffs late last year, so the company leadership could try to retain control.</p>
<p>Bungie is remaining committed to supporting Destiny 2 going forward and the development of extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, but the company’s future still feels uncertain. Jeff Grubb is claiming that, in time, <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1818686383449346538">Sony will take over control of Bungie’s management</a>, similar to all other developers owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>

            <p>Jail shake-and-breaker management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2 </a>has been delayed indefinitely, a couple of months after publishers Paradox parted ways with original developers Double Eleven. Current developers Kokku will use the additional time "to improve both the game's performance and its content". Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a "robust" release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.</p><!--more-->
<p>Released into 1.0 in 2015, and developed by Introversion, the original Prison Architect is an old RPS favourite. Our own judge-at-large Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-review">sentenced</a> it to a Bestest Best, with time added for being "an excellent story-making game" and for being "the only management game that has made me feel sheepish". Introversion sold the property rights to Paradox in 2019, who subsequently put Double Eleven in charge of on-going development. </p>
<p>Announced in January this year, the sequel both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-is-official-bringing-paradoxs-jail-management-sim-to-3d">impressed and dismayed</a> Katharine (RPS in peace) with its newly 3D graphics. Once due for release in March, it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-has-been-pushed-from-its-already-delayed-release-date-next-month-all-the-way-back-to-autumn">repeatedly delayed</a>. Then, in May, Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-developers-part-ways-with-paradox-months-before-its-due-for-release">revealed</a> that they and Double Eleven had failed "to find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties moving forward and mutually agreed to part ways". This came after the game had passed certification on all platforms. And yet, it seems that there's still more work to be done.</p>
<p>"At this stage, we can't commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready," a Paradox rep <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/">explained in a forum post today</a>. "Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with."</p>
<p>The post includes a FAQ that goes into slightly more detail about what needs fine-tuning. "Prison Architect is a game with deep systems that all interact with each other, and this is also something we want to bring with us into the sequel, Prison Architect 2," it reads. "Having systems like this in a game also means that a small change in one area will also affect one or more other areas, which we then also need to apply fixes to. Improving the performance has proven to be a task that will take time."</p>
<p>Going by Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-is-coming-up-for-release-but-its-hard-to-rehabilitate-from-years-of-2d">hands-on preview</a> from May, Prison Architect 2's problems are at once more straightforward and more fundamental than a few misbehaving systems eating into the frame-rate. "Thematically and mechanically, Prison Architect is about control," he wrote. "It is about little people's lives being directed to a tragicomically draconian degree. But if this franchise is all about being the overbearing loon in charge of every minor detail, does a 3D camera complement that feeling of jealous control? For me, not hugely. If anything, the top-down 2D view of the original allowed you to quickly parse more information."</p>
<p>The Paradox post notes that the delay announcement "aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to reviewing and improving the quality of our released content." This may allude to CEO Fredrik Wester's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-ceo-admits-company-made-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-in-wake-of-life-by-yous-cancellation">admission last month</a> that the publishers have "made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change". Paradox's recent activities include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">shuttering Tectonic, developers of Life By You</a>, washing their hands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">Harebrained Schemes</a><a></a> following dismal sales of Lamplighters League, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">handing off the infamously troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 to The Chinese Room</a> after years of development under Hardsuit Labs. Prison Architect 2 has only been in the public eye for a few months - hopefully it won't end up in a similar purgatorial state.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo is adding Game Boy Advance title Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team to its Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack catalogue.
</p>
<p>
The role-playing game spin-off from the main Pokémon series joins Nintendo's subscription library next week, on 9th August.
</p>
<p>
This is the first Pokémon game from the Game Boy Advance era to land on Nintendo Switch Online, which has so far offered other spin-offs such as Pokémon Snap, originally on N64, and Pokémon Trading Card Game, originally on Game Boy.
</p>
<p>
If you've not played a Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, this long-running spin-off RPG series sees you playing as Pokémon and lets you speak to others.

</p></div>
<p>
Red Rescue Team was one of a duo of games, with Blue Rescue Team released at the same time for the Nintendo DS (which isn't currently part of the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue).
</p>
<p>
"Mystery Dungeon has hidden depths that make up for any drawbacks," we wrote in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-pokemondungeon-ds">review of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team</a> back in 2006. "As the game progresses, dungeons become more interesting places - and dangerous ones, filled with lava and traps and the like. Levelling up your teammates, managing your inventory, and clearing out dungeons becomes compelling pretty quickly - even though the sidequest structure allows you to play the game as slowly as you like."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-offering-extra-two-months-on-switch-online-membership-renewals">Nintendo is currently offering an additional two months of Nintendo Switch Online free</a> when you buy a 12-month  subscription via the eShop or My Nintendo Store.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-well-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-works-as-well-on-pc-as-it-does-on-playstation-5-setup-is-easy.942939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-well-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation VR2 headset is finally becoming compatible with PC next week, and it seems like the headset works on PC as well as it does on PlayStation 5, according to a new video shared online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMERGEN_/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamergen</a> on YouTube and summarized by ResetERA forums members <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-ot-vr-using-our-senses.688708/post-126590970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cilidra</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-ot-vr-using-our-senses.688708/post-126593391" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DjRare</a>, the Sony headset works very well on PC, with good tracking, image quality, and easy setup, even with the beta version of the app. The only complaints are the same for using the headset on PlayStation 5, namely the headset's cable and sweet spot. At the end of the day, the adapter bringing compatibility with PC is a great purchase for those who already own the headset and a VR-ready PC, thanks to its low cost. Those who don't own the headset, however, may find other compelling options, according to Gamergen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nous AVONS TESTE le PSVR 2 sur PC ! - UNBOXING Test Impressions GAMEPLAY Half Life Alyx Adaptateur" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4035mJVWe0?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's great to hear the PlayStation VR2 works well on PC. The introduction of compatibility with the most common VR gaming platform and its recent price drop may breathe new life into the headset, which isn't getting supported by Sony as much as it should have. You can learn more about the headset by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With a pricetag befitting of next-generation hardware, the PlayStation VR2 headset offers a virtual reality experience that's unique to the PlayStation 5 ecosystem. Only time will tell if the new technology is worth the investment but all of the design changes and new features make me excited for what's to come in the future for PlayStation VR2.</em></p>

			<p>The Earth Defense Force series has always embraced the inherit silliness of its alien-blasting premise – any action game that prioritises singing alongside gunplay, definitely doesn’t take itself too seriously. For EDF 6, that embrace has become an aggressive yet surprisingly tender cuddle, and it is, without doubt, the most bombastically bonkers and brilliant EDF yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earth Defense Force 6 - Launch Trailer PS5/PS4/PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVUhQ9lHkss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who have never played an EDF game before, the set-up is simple enough. You and your team of fellow players (four players online or two via local split-screen) must shoot your way through each level from a third-person perspective, clearing the mountains, cityscapes, and fields of their alien invaders. Foes are many and varied, from hordes of giant ants to armoured gun-toting anthropomorphic frogs and swarms of deadly flying drones. Levels are fairly small environments and can be played in no more than fifteen minutes, ensuring the pace of the game is fast, frenetic, and highly addictive, not least because the combat is completely over-the-top explosive madness. Let’s face it, blowing an alien soldier through the side of a building with an enormous rocket and then seeing the rubble to collapse on their prone form will always be a delight.</p>


<p>There are four different player characters to choose from: an all-purpose Ranger, a flying jet-pack equipped Wing-Diver, a support-calling Air Raider, and a heavily armed and armoured Fencer. There have been a few tweaks made to each class, though nothing earth-shaking. Rangers continue to be the best all-rounder, their ability to deploy more vehicles to drive is a welcome addition. Wing-Divers meanwhile have a far more generous energy meter from the offset, allowing the player to fly to the top of a tower and rain down laser beam hell on the enemy below. Air-Raiders now utilise drones to deploy most of their attacks, ensuring a huge amount of weapon and item variety for players prepared to take on the challenge of not using any proper guns. Finally, Fencers remain reliable in their four weapons totting combo, though with a notable improvement in manoeuvrability. In short, it’s the same set of characters that you know and love, just slightly better.</p>


<p>There are literally hundreds of weapons to choose from, giving almost impossible amounts of variety. Laser guns, grenades, bazookas, missile launchers, mech suits, EDF 6 has it all. &nbsp;Of course, this being an EDF game, far too many of them are utter pants and will only ever be used once before being discarded for a trusty shotgun. The trial-and-error approach is all part of the fun, as is bringing completely the wrong weapon for a level and being unable to kill any aliens – levels with unexpected flying creatures, I’m looking at you. Still, does it make me sound weird to say that I like all that stuff? That all this clunkiness adds to the very particular charm of an EDF game?</p>
<p>In fact, a huge part of the charm of Earth Defense Force is its slightly shonky quality. Whilst EDF 6 certainly makes the most of its generational leap – the armies of enemies you face are vast and screen-filling in their numbers and the draw-distance goes for miles – it also retains the ramshackle look that so appeals to the franchise’s ardent fanbase. Take the graphical detail as an example, though the visuals are far more polished, a few frames of animation are still missing from each player character and enemy model, keeping the B-movie-inspired aesthetic from previous games.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that a whole host of improvements haven’t been made elsewhere, because they have. Vehicles, the bane of a player’s existence in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/10/earth-defense-force-5-review/">EDF 5</a>, have been drastically improved. It may not sound like much to those who aren’t devoted members of the force, but bikes, tanks, and helicopters are now actually controllable. In the last game, daring to clamber atop a motorbike would be met with shame-faced hilarity as you immediately skidded out of control and embedded yourself in a skyscraper. Meanwhile, helicopters would crash as soon as you even thought about steering them. In EDF 6 all these problems have been fixed, and I delighted in zooming around on my bike like an extra from Akira, shredding giant spiders with my twin machine guns before pirouetting away to make my escape in a cloud of dust. It’s glorious!</p>
<p>Player control has been sorted out too, with your avatar happily, and automatically, clambering over any obstacles they encounter, rendering those many moments your hulking soldier was trapped behind a particularly prominent piece of pavement a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Talking of the past, the time-travel-based Terminator 2-like plot is surprisingly decent and cram-packed with plenty of twists and turns. Sure, it is utter nonsense, but it is oddly compelling nonsense. However, it’s likely to be more meaningful to those who have played through EDF 5, for which EDF 6 is a direct continuation.</p>
<p>This direct sequel approach has given developer Sandlot a decent excuse to revisit levels and reuse art assets from the last game. Swathes of levels are lifted directly from EDF 5, though this time there are time-traveling aliens altering the time-space continuum to contend with. A level that you had previously played to death is suddenly turned on its head when enormous grenade-totting androids turn up. It has led to what is the biggest EDF yet,&nbsp;and true EDFers already know that 100% completion will involve playing through each level multiple times with every character anyway.</p>

            <p>This week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs</a> at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> studio Bungie were planned out months ago, former employees have told journalist Stephen Totilo at <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the">Game File</a> (paywalled). According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-buying-destiny-devs-bungie-for-36-billion">bought Bungie in 2022</a> for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On Wednesday, it emerged that Bungie were laying off 220 people - about 17% of their total workforce - across multiple departments including design, art, narrative, and sound. Additionally, they announced the transfer of a further 155 roles to SIE, with the aim to form a new PlayStation studio working on an “untitled incubation project.”</p>
<p>CEO Pete Parsons <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">attributed</a> the upheaval to dire financial straits at the studio, mentioning “a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry,” and “our quality miss with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Lightfall”. Although Totilo’s sources point out that the well-received Final Shape actually sold worse than the panned Lightfall, the recent layoffs seemingly have little to do with the Final Shape’s commercial performance either way, and “couldn't be avoided” even if The Final Shape had "blockbuster performance”.</p>
<p>The layoffs sound to be a continuation of the cuts made last October, which saw around 100 staff laid off, including veteran composer Michael Salvatori. The report also suggests that Bungie’s financial troubles existed long before the Sony acquisition, with one former employee saying the "alternate history is insolvency" if the studio weren’t acquired, adding "Destiny is an incredibly expensive game to make.”</p>
<p>As for the future of Destiny 2 itself, Moises Taveras at Kotaku <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-content-packs-no-expansions-bungie-layoffs-1851611360">paints a picture</a> of a much-diminished on-going timeline for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>, which is unsurprising given how much critical talent is no longer with the studio.  “There appears to be no certainty that Destiny will even be around in a few years,” writes Taveras, “or that it’s a priority to the studio outside of being a cash cow riddled with microtransactions.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Prison Architect 2 has been indefinitely delayed so publisher Paradox can improve its performance and content.
</p>
<p>
The game was expected to release on 3rd September, but has now been delayed for the third time this year.
</p>
<p>
The news was shared in a statement from Paradox, explaining the team "need more time to improve both the game's performance and its content" as internal reviews and beta test groups highlight these require more work.

"At this stage, we can't commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work that is needed to be done before the game is release-ready," reads the statement.
</p>
<p>
"Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with.
</p>
<p>
"This decision aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to review and improve the quality of our released content. We are confident that delaying Prison Architect 2 is the best path forward for the game, allowing us more time to deliver a high-quality experience that honours the legacy of Prison Architect."

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">Paradox parted ways with developer Double Eleven</a> after nine years working on the management series as it "could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties".

</p>
<p>
The game was revealed in January this year, promising a "greater degree of player freedom, impactful choices, and inmate simulation". Now, this indefinite delay puts the future of the game into question.
</p>
<p>
Still, as the statement points out, the delay to Prison Architect 2 aligns with Paradox's commitment to improve its output. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">CEO Fredrol Wester admitted the company had "made the wrong calls in several projects"</a> following the cancellation of its The Sims competitor Life By You.

</p>
<p>
The publisher appears to be in troubled times, with this Prison Architect 2 delay adding to other disappointments, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">poor performance of Cities: Skylines 2</a> at launch and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">refunded DLC</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure of The Lamplighters' League</a>.

            <p>
Bungie is no longer working on Payback, a new project set in the Destiny universe once overseen by franchise bosses Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy.
</p>
<p>
That's according to reporting by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">Gamespot</a>'s Tamoor Hussain, Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y">Jeff Grubb</a> and Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier</a>, who all state that Smith and Noseworthy are also now no longer at Bungie.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-3-discussion-swirls-following-accurate-expansion-leak">Details of Payback leaked online back in April</a>, when it was described as "Destiny 3". There were questions at the time over whether the project was still in development. Now, Schreier has confirmed that Payback was more of a spin-off, and was cancelled "a while ago". 
</p>
<p>
According to the previously-leaked details on Payback, the game would have shaken up the Destiny franchise by moving away from a class-based character system. Its name was allegedly a reference to "Bungie getting payback against themselves by creating something they hope everyone will love".
</p>
<p>
Smith and Noseworthy's departures appear linked to the cancellation of Payback, ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">latest round of layoffs which hit Bungie this week</a>, when 220 jobs were lost. Gamespot sources said executive restructuring meant the pair had "no path forward at Bungie".
</p>
<p>
Both Smith and Noseworthy were Bungie veterans, with the former at the company since 2007. The pair worked closely together on building the Destiny franchise, perhaps memorably on the excellent Taken King expansion. Their departures now further confuse the picture of what Bungie plans to do with Destiny next, following the launch of climactic expansion The Final Shape earlier this year.
</p>
<p>Reporting last night by GameFile claimed that Bungie leadership reportedly "overstated" its own financial prospects to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Sony, which bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6bn</a>, leading to the need for this year's brutal layoffs. </p>
<p>Staff have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">roundly criticised Bungie boss Pete Parsons for the job losses</a>, while affected employees have been speaking out - including <a href="https://x.com/TheRealLexuzi/status/1818699387809529898">one woman made redundant on the eve of her maternity leave</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Intel is cutting 15,000 jobs as part of a swathe of "significant actions to reduce costs" and save $10m in 2025.</p>
<p>CEO Pat Gelsinger said those 15,000 jobs represent 15 percent of its global workforce and come after the computing megacorp reported no profits from the last financial quarter.</p>
<p>Other cost-cutting exercises to make "Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company" include reducing operating costs, simplifying its portfolio, eliminating complexity, reducing capital, suspending its dividend, and maintaining growth investments.</p>

<p>In a statement, Gelsinger pointed out that four years ago – at the height of the pandemic – Intel's annual revenue was $24bn higher than it is today, despite its workforce swelling by 10 percent across the same period.</p>
<p>"This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history," Gelsinger said.</p>
<p>"These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritise a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come."</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to save money, the company will also enhance its retirement and voluntary exit procedures in a bid to reduce its headcount.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Destiny developer Bungie laid off another 220 staff</a>, representing roughly 17 percent of the studio's workforce. Another 155+ staff are being moved to roles within Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>In October last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">studio laid off 100 staff</a> from its then 1200-strong workforce.

            <p>
Nintendo's sales for Switch hardware and software have seen big declines as the console nears the end of its life.
</p>
<p>
In its latest earnings report, Nintendo stated a 46.3 percent decline year-on-year of console sales, while software has declined 41.3 percent year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
However, this is largely due to the huge success Nintendo had in 2023. The release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie "energised" game sales, while the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> boosted both software and hardware sales.

<p>

"There were no such special factors in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and with Nintendo Switch now in its eighth year since launch, unit sales of both hardware and software decreased significantly year-on year," reads the report.
</p>
<p>
There has still been some success this quarter, however, with both Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD reaching over a million sales: 1.76m units and 1.19m units respectively. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-showtime-review">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a>, meanwhile, has sold over 1.3m units since its release in March.

			<p>Fans have decided to develop the Bloodborne remaster that Sony doesn't seem interested in making ahead of the game, becoming playable on PC via emulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fromsoftserve</a>, a well-known Souls series modder, revealed a few days ago that they are working on a Bloodborne visual overhaul mod that will bring upscaled textures, dynamic shadows, better reflections, and more. In the video below, the modder explains why they are developing this mod while showing how they are going about improving Central Yarnham.</p>
<p><iframe title="I'm making a Bloodborne visual overhaul mod and here's why" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aI3lXJuRXt4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it may be a little early to develop a visual overhaul mod for a game that cannot be emulated properly, the day Bloodborne will become playable on PC is getting closer and closer. As reported on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1818920762310275520/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pirat_Nation</a>, the shadPS4 emulator, which has been making some <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-red-dead-redemption-playable/">amazing progress lately</a>, is now capable of getting in-game in Dark Souls Remastered, which is powered by the same engine that powers Bloodborne. It may still be months or even years away, but it's looking more and more likely that the popular PlayStation 4 exclusive will eventually become playable on PC, with some of its most glaring technical issues fixed as well.</p>
<p>As of now, the only way to play Bloodborne is on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Those with a jailbroken console can also install the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-patch-released/">unofficial 60 FPS patch</a> that was released online a while back.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced that the popular GBA title Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team will arrive for Switch on August 9. Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion members will have access to this title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team is a game in which players wake up in the world of Pokemon as Pokemon themselves. They must figure out why they have been turned into this creature while befriending other Pokemon and beating ever-changing dungeons. Additionally, all Pokemon aren’t your friends, so watch out for some strong ones while you search for the dungeon’s treasures.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-better-visuals-on-nintendo-switch">Better Visuals on Nintendo Switch</h2>



<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team is an enhanced reimagination of the GBA title and of Nintendo DS’ Blue Rescue Team. The game has received a visual upgrade for the Nintendo Switch, allowing you to experience the title with more fidelity on TV, tabletop, or handheld modes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-features-for-nintendo-switch">New Gameplay Features for Nintendo Switch</h2>



<p>Moreover, the Nintendo Switch version introduces new gameplay features that enhance the gaming experience for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team. For instance, Auto Mode allows players to progress through their journey more efficiently, with their team moving automatically with just a press of the ‘L’ button. This feature is handy when exploring dungeons, as it automatically shuts off when enemies are near, allowing for strategic gameplay. Another new feature, Unleashing Best Moves, will enable players to unleash their Pokemon’s best moves by pressing the ‘A’ button.</p>



<h2 id="h-other-new-features">Other New Features</h2>



<p>Furthermore, the Switch version introduces a new feature that allows players to make more Pokemon friends and get help when they faint. In the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team, players could have a maximum of 3 members in their party. However, with the Switch version, players can add the Pokemon they encounter in a dungeon to their team, increasing the max cap to 8 team members. If a player faints, other players can rescue them, or they can rescue themselves using one of their rescue teams.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-mega-multiplayer-festival-offers-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Multiplayer Sale</a> is now live. Also, the court sentenced the man who threatened Nintendo<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/man-threatening-nintendo-receives-one-year-prison-sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> to one year in prison</a>.

            <p>
Nailgun-toting FEAR-meets-GZDoom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a> is now Steam Deck Verified, allowing you to either impress or appal fellow train commuters with your knack for pixel splatter. That's not all: developers Altered Orbit Studios have outlined planned features for the next round of updates. They include backpacks that considerately replenish your weapons, fresh story material, a tune-up for the enemy AI in the game's second chapter, and a "Randomizer" system that scrambles spawns and pick-ups while introducing weapon rarities, for beaucoup replay value.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"Getting the Steam Deck to behave according to Valve's quality expectations on GZDoom took a good amount of hard work, but we managed to get it done in the end," the devs write in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791469846912&amp;emgid=4374768959778727710">a Steam blog</a>. Selaco won't get an official early access roadmap, the post adds, because Altered Orbit regard such things as detrimental. "Roadmaps tend to have a negative effect on development/work. Experimentation with new ideas takes time, while roadmaps are schedule-focused and don't allow for such things. When something is in the works, we will let you know through these posts!"
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, there's plenty to share right now about future additions. The next significant Selaco update will include backpack reloading, which discreetly tops up any guns you haven't equipped for a while, providing there are bullets to spare. This is an optional convenience for the player prone to absent-mindedly brandishing an empty handcannon at the worst possible moment - you can turn it off in the settings.
</p>
<p>
The update will also rebalance the guns, with automatic weapons in particular due a polish. "The current version on Steam has an oversight where there is a solid chance to roll low damage numbers consecutively, making some automatic weapons feel weaker than they are meant to be," the devs note. They're also going to remove and replace the system whereby enemies were less easy to stagger on higher difficulties, as this has simply made some weapons less useful. Beyond that, expect new visual and audio effects and map interactables, performance boosts and quality-of-life adjustments such as "a DMR that respects your hold/toggle setting".
</p>
<p>
Further afield, Altered Orbit are planning "a major voice-over pass to flesh out Dawn as a character, the world of Selaco and the general plot" for end of the year. They're working on AI improvements, including "better Patrol modes, a goal system, [and a] cover system". They're also looking at letting players adjust the difficulty mid-campaign, together with the ability to customise mutators (these being campaign modifers such as enemies having faster projectile speed).
</p>
<p>
Safe rooms will eventually become "more interesting and useful" with free one-time health caches and an armor shop. And then there's Randomizer, slated to drop alongside the major voice-over pass at end of 2024, which "randomizes enemy spawns, introduces a Rarity System where some weapons and enemies are more powerful than usual, repositions ammo pickups and offers tons of customization to tweak the game to your liking."
</p>
<p>
The enemy AI improvements and various other features should arrive as part of the game's Chapter 2, which is "coming along nicely". I've yet to play Selaco but this certainly sounds like an early access project that's hitting its stride. In our launch day <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/selaco-early-access-review">Selaco review</a> from June, resident RPS triggerman Ed Thorn hailed it as "a wonderful balance between tactical and frenetic, with intricate maps and immersive sim tomfoolery that'll delight and potentially frustrate".
