            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-era-100-bluetooth-and-wifi-speaker-drops-to-record-low-price-amazon-offloads-last-units-before-christmas-2000653537</link>
            <guid>1384162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are a lot of Bluetooth speakers to choose from, from cheap ones to expensive ones. But Sonos always comes out on top in the mid- to high-end range, where sound quality matters more than just getting loud. The<strong> Era 100 is Sonos’s small smart speaker</strong> for rooms where full-sized speakers are too big <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">and it’s now $169 on Amazon, down from its original price of $199</a>. This is the lowest price ever just before Christmas which makes it a great gift for music lovers who value good sound quality over flashy features.</p>
<p>The Era 100 has <strong>WiFi streaming, Bluetooth connectivity, and Trueplay room correction</strong> all in one small package that can fit on a kitchen counter or nightstand. It also has stereo separation that most single-unit speakers can’t match which makes it the perfect way to get started with Sonos or a useful addition to an existing multi-room setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Architecture with two tweeters</h2>
<p>Sonos designed the Era 100 with t<strong>wo tweeters that point outward to create real left and right channel separation in one box</strong> which makes music sound wider and more open than regular mono speakers. The two tweeters in this design let you hear instruments spread out across a soundstage instead of all coming from one point in space. The new Sonos speakers have a processor that is 47% faster than the old ones and lets them process audio more accurately, even at high volumes, so they don’t distort like other speakers do when they are pushed too hard. The<strong> midwoofer is 25% bigger and handles bass frequencies with authority</strong>, and gives you a low-end punch that you can feel in your chest without needing a separate subwoofer for most types of music.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning technology turns the Era 100 from a good speaker into one that works best in your room by <strong>using your iPhone’s microphone to figure out how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces</strong>: You walk around the room waving your phone, which lets the speaker map the room’s acoustic features and change its output as needed. Trueplay makes sure that the sound quality is always the same, no matter where the speaker is. For example, a speaker in a corner sounds very different from one on a bookshelf or kitchen counter.</p>
<p>WiFi streaming is what makes the Era 100 connect: You can access music services like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many more directly through the Sonos app. This network-based method gives you better sound quality than Bluetooth compression and lets you play different content in each room or group speakers together. The speaker also works with AirPlay 2, which makes it easy to connect to Apple devices.</p>



<p>The <strong>small size is just under 7 inches tall and 5 inches wide</strong> and makes it easy to put almost anywhere without taking up too much space. The matte black or white finish on the Era 100 makes it look good on both modern minimalist shelves and traditional wood furniture. The top panel has touch controls for play, pause, volume, and skip, so you can interact with it even when your phone isn’t right there.</p>
<p>At this price, the Era 100 is now competitive with mid-range Bluetooth speakers that don’t have WiFi streaming, room correction, or multi-room capabilities.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonos Offloads Beam Soundbar at Record Low, Now Cheaper Than Basic Alternative and Perfect Christmas Gift]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-beam-soundbar-at-record-low-now-cheaper-than-basic-alternative-and-perfect-christmas-gift-2000653510</link>
            <guid>1384141</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flat-screen TVs are getting thinner and better looking all the time, but this design change means that the sound quality suffers because manufacturers can’t fit good speakers into panels that are only a few millimeters thick. A good soundbar fills this gap by giving your beautiful 4K or OLED display the sound it needs and make movie nights and music listening truly immersive.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">soundbar is now on sale on Amazon for $369, down from its list price of $499</a>. This is the lowest price ever which makes it a great <strong>Christmas gift for yourself or anyone whose TV audio sounds flat and lifeless</strong>. This small soundbar works just as well under wall-mounted TVs or on entertainment centers and brings Dolby Atmos spatial audio and multi-room music streaming to living rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos</h2>
<p>The Beam Gen 2 processes <strong>Dolby Atmos audio tracks to make height channels that make sound seem to come from above and around you</strong> and adds a vertical dimension to the usual left-right stereo field. This technology for spatial audio makes it sound like helicopters are flying over you, rain is falling from the ceiling, and background noises put you in the scene instead of just in front of it. Psychoacoustic processing and carefully angled drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling make it sound like you have dedicated height speakers without actually installing them.</p>



<p>The Beam’s center channel focuses on voice frequencies to make sure you hear every word without turning up the volume, which is one of the most common complaints about TV audio. With this dedicated dialogue processing, you won’t miss important plot points when people are whispering or need subtitles to understand speech with an accent. When you watch news or dramas with a lot of dialogue, the <em>Speech Enhancement</em> feature in the Sonos app boosts voice frequencies even more. It gives you customizable clarity that works with different types of content.</p>
<p>Trueplay tuning technology <strong>uses your iPhone’s microphone to figure out how sound bounces off the walls</strong> and other surfaces in your room and then automatically changes the Beam’s output to make up for any problems with the sound. Rooms with hard floors and bare walls that make harsh reflections get tuned differently than rooms with carpet and soft furniture that absorbs sound. This calibration process only takes about two minutes, but it makes the sound much better than using generic soundbar settings that assume the same room acoustics.</p>



<p>To set it up, all you need are two cables: <strong>one HDMI eARC cable that goes from your TV to the device and one power cord that goes to an outlet</strong>. The soundbar automatically finds your TV and works with your current remote, so you don’t have to switch between controllers or set up universal remotes. With Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Sonos Voice Control, you can change the volume, skip songs, or switch inputs without using a remote. With Apple AirPlay 2 support, you can stream music wirelessly from iPhones, iPads, and Macs.</p>
<p>The Beam Gen 2 is now competitive with mid-range soundbars that don’t have Dolby Atmos or multi-room capabilities because the price dropped from $499 to $369. Anyone who wants to improve their TV’s sound quality beyond the mediocre built-in speakers will get a lot of value from it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wardrum is what would happen if you mixed Fire Emblem with Parappa the Rapper]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/wardrum-is-what-would-happen-if-you-mixed-fire-emblem-with-parappa-the-rapper/</link>
            <guid>1384123</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I love a good elevator pitch, and Wardrum, the latest from Team17 Digital and Mopeful Games, has an absolute doozy. “Fire Emblem meets Parappa the Rapper” sounds absolutely brilliant, but only if you can wrap your head around a world that mixes those two utterly different games together. What could it possible mean? Well, Wardrum is a Tactical Rhythm Roguelite – though, that alone would make it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/lost-eidolons-veil-of-the-witch-review/">Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch</a> – that’s taken a note out of games like Parappa the Rapper, or perhaps the Mario and Luigi games, so you have to perform your actions in time with the music to maximise your damage, or secure your defence. Whatever it turns out to be like, the idea of it alone already has me sold. </p>
<p><iframe title="Wardrum | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUDV13huGew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The beat-heavy trailer gives you an impression of what kind of beats and tunes you’ll be banging along to, and there’s already some Patapon-like tones in there that have me even more excited. Wardrum is set in a harsh and unforgiving fantasy landscape, and you have to plan and execute your tactical moves in time with the primal pounding of a tribal wardrum for maximum impact. </p>
<p>Off-beat magic has infected the lands, neighbouring settlements have fallen and it’s up to you and a band of five warriors to keep the beat. You’ll have to venture out into the harsh fantasy world and stop the source of this off-beat threat once and for all. </p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of games marry turn-based combat with timed elements, not least one of this year’s biggest hits, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Given how successful that game has been, maybe the general public will be more open than ever to a cool, well-executed tactical game with rhythm-action elements. </p>


<p>Your ongoing quest will take place across six distinctive biomes with randomised map paths, navigating through battles, sanctuaries and other events to go toe to toe against dangerous bosses. Alongside the big guys, there’s a great lineup of 35 menacing enemies that require careful tactical planning to overcome.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of Fire Emblem, Wardrum looks like it’ll give you a very different take on tactical action, and it’s one that I’m already looking forward to trying out. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell i7 1TB Laptop Rated 5/5 Stars Drops 73% Off on Amazon, Crashes to All-Time Low With $200 Bonus Pack]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-i7-1tb-laptop-rated-5-5-stars-drops-73-off-on-amazon-crashes-to-all-time-low-with-200-bonus-pack-2000653526</link>
            <guid>1384120</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart shoppers know that paying full price on official brand websites often means leaving hundreds of dollars on the table that could stay in your pocket. A capable laptop doesn’t require a $2,000 investment when strategic shopping reveals the same specs at drastically lower prices through different retailers.</p>
<p>This Dell Inspiron 15″ touchscreen <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6406/">laptop sells for $759 on Amazon right now, marked down from its typical $2,799 price tag</a>, while Dell’s official site shows no such promotion. This is <strong>a record low that slashes over $2,000 off</strong> a machine featuring a 13th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD that handles everything from office work to content creation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6406/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>13th-Gen Intel Core i7 Has Processing Power That Lasts for Years</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Core i7-1355U processor has 10 cores</strong> which are split between performance and efficiency cores which lets it handle demanding applications while still having a good battery life. This hybrid architecture gives performance cores to heavy tasks like video rendering or compilation and efficiency cores to light workloads and background processes. The processor can boost up to 5.0 GHz, which gives it the power it needs to run professional software like Adobe Premiere, AutoCAD, or Excel spreadsheets with thousands of rows.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen</strong> is useful in a way that some touch-enabled laptops aren’t. When editing photos, adding notes to documents, or scrolling through long web pages, it feels natural to directly interact with interface elements. The WVA panel doesn’t glare, so you can still see it in bright offices or near windows where shiny screens turn into mirrors. Windows 11’s touch support is better than in previous versions and it has better palm rejection and gesture controls that are more responsive, which makes people more productive instead of annoying them with accidental inputs.</p>



<p>The <strong>85% screen-to-body ratio</strong> makes the bezels around the display as small as possible, giving the laptop a modern look and maximizing the amount of screen space within its physical footprint. The wide range of ports, <strong>which includes both legacy USB-A ports and modern USB-C ports</strong>, fixes one of the most annoying trends in modern laptops. For photographers and videographers who need to transfer footage from their cameras, <strong>the SD card reader</strong> is a must-have and <strong>HDMI 1.4</strong> makes it easy to connect to external monitors without needing dongles.</p>
<p>The Windows 11 Pro edition has business features that the Home edition does not, such as BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, and Hyper-V virtualization. This makes this laptop good for workplaces that need extra security. With the Pro license, you also have more control over Windows updates. With Copilot AI integration, Microsoft’s generative AI assistant is built right into the operating system and can help you write, generate code, and provide contextual help without having to switch to other apps or websites.</p>
<p>This i7-powered laptop is now in the same price range as budget Chromebooks and entry-level Windows machines with much worse specs, thanks to a savings of more than $2,000. At this price point, many laptops still come with older i5 processors, 8GB of RAM, and smaller SSDs and this Dell configuration stands out from the rest.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs are a niche category where lesser-known brands dominate by assembling components into compact machines that prioritize space-saving over brand recognition. Apple’s Mac mini faces virtually no real competition in this segment, and combines<strong> iconic industrial design with performance and connectivity that generic mini PCs struggle to match</strong>.</p>
<p>The latest Mac mini with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage currently sells for $479 on Amazon, reduced from its $599 list price</a>, and hits a record low that eclipses the competition just before Christmas. This newest generation shrinks the already-compact form factor down to five by five inches while packing a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU that outperforms most desktop computers twice its size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s fourth-generation custom silicon and it <strong>has a 10-core CPU that is split into performance and efficiency cores</strong> which handle demanding tasks and background processes in a smart way. This architecture gives the Mac mini performance that is on par with Intel and AMD desktop processors, but it uses much less power.</p>
<p>This means that the Mac mini can run quietly without the loud fan noise that comes with most desktop towers. The <strong>10-core GPU can handle graphics-heavy tasks</strong> like editing photos in Lightroom, editing 4K videos in Final Cut Pro and even playing moderate games through Apple Arcade or native Mac games. Unified memory architecture gives the CPU and GPU 16GB of memory to share and gets rid of the slowdowns that happen when separate graphics cards have to move data back and forth between system RAM.</p>



<p>The new chassis is only five by five inches which is about the same size as a big coffee mug on a desk. It can do the same things that a full-size desktop tower can do. This smaller size makes the Mac mini perfect for minimalist desk setups, small apartments where space is at a premium, or workstations with multiple monitors where tower PCs would take up too much space. The aluminum construction passively dissipates heat while keeping the high quality that Apple products are known for.</p>
<p>Port configuration finally fixes one of the Mac mini’s long-standing problems by adding <strong>USB-C ports on the front and a headphone jack</strong> that makes it easier to reach around than in previous generations. The front ports make it much easier to connect USB drives, charging cables, or headphones on a daily basis. The back panel still has<strong> Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI output, and Gigabit Ethernet for permanent connections</strong>. Thunderbolt 4 can connect up to three 6K displays or one 8K display and gives creative professionals and productivity users the ability to use more than one monitor at a time.</p>



<p>With Apple Intelligence integration, AI-powered features are built right into the operating system: These features include help with writing, summarizing emails, and organizing photos intelligently without sending data to other servers. This <strong>processing on the device keeps your information private</strong> while also giving you features like smart replies, automatic transcription, and suggestions based on what you’re doing that help you get more done.</p>
<p>Right now, <strong>the M4 Mac mini is now cheaper than many prebuilt Windows desktops</strong> that don’t come with a monitor and have worse processors.</p>

            <guid>1384102</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>As is tradition, Geoff Keighley kicked off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-BDeU3R5ic&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>last week’s Game Awards</u></a> with a speech. Defying the show’s established norms, he took things in a personal direction, informing the audience that in 2025 his house burned down in the LA fires, and his father passed away. He found solace, however, in games: “Games have this incredible ability to hold us when we’re hurting, to lift us up when we feel small, to give us somewhere to go when the real world feels unsteady,” he said. “That’s why we’re all connected in this moment: We’re here to celebrate the artists, technicians, and storytellers who help this medium soar to new heights.” But outside the show’s gilded walls, many felt ignored rather than celebrated.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Game Developer</u></a> broke the news that the Game Awards’ Future Class – a program meant to honor and facilitate annual cohorts of industry professionals who “represent the bright, bold, and inclusive future of video games” – has effectively been put on ice. This followed a prolonged period of silence from the organization after Future Class members began demanding more from Keighley and those running it: travel, resources, funding, and networking opportunities more in line with the way the program had been presented over the years, as well as public statements acknowledging ills those in the world of games and beyond could no longer afford to ignore, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/keighley-summer-game-fest-layoffs/"><u>layoffs</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/one-week-and-2600-signatures-later-game-awards-havent-acknowledged-future-class-palestine-letter/"><u>the genocide in Palestine</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Thursday, anger around the Future Class’ dissolution – as well as the callousness with which many companies handed shimmering trophies at The Game Awards continue to cast aside thousands of workers – coalesced into a protest organized by <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">United Videogame Workers</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk/"><u>the union anyone, even laid-off workers, can join</u></a> announced by Communications Workers of America (CWA) at GDC earlier this year. </p><blockquote>"The moment we actually tried to ask for something better – or for them to put their money where their mouth is – they just quietly killed the program.”</blockquote><p>The theme of the protest was “The Industry Is Dead,” and many of the 50 or so developers who showed up took that to heart. A handful dressed in grim reaper outfits, while others carried signs shaped like tombstones. One read “RIP Future Class, Died Of Performative Allyship.” The UVW chair who made it, freelance writer and narrative designer Anna C Webster, was a former Future Class member.</p><p>“You’d think that we as the Future Class would at least know what the future of our program looks like,” she told Aftermath. “But they basically did not communicate that at all until we got together and said ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ To say that we’re disappointed is probably an understatement. It’s very disappointing that someone with the platform Geoff has is not using it for good. The moment we actually tried to ask for something better – or for them to put their money where their mouth is – they just quietly killed the program.”</p><p>Younès Rabii, a former Future Class member who organized an open letter urging Keighley and co to acknowledge Israel’s inhuman treatment of Palestinians, expressed a similar sentiment.&nbsp;</p><p>"The way that Future Class members were treated by The Game Awards, it feels like we outlived our usefulness of diverse faces smiling for the camera,” Rabii, who did not attend this year’s Game Awards, told Aftermath. “Once we tried to ask the structure to put money where its mouth was, the facade crumbled. I vividly remember that during the only meeting we had after the 2023 show, when I asked Geoff Keighley why he ignored our open letter, he angrily replied ‘This is my show, and nobody gets to tell me how I should use my platform.’ What else is there to say?"</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5gdejlhcswjbzraadoltdpps/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7qp7qq7ck2f" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiain5szjiftjjaxnk3gah3rgzceafnniziltvxuo73xrxpshxo5fq"><p lang="en">around 40 game developers affiliated with @videogameworkers.bsky.social have gathered outside the peacock theater, where the game awards will take place in a few hours, for a “the industry is dead” demonstration</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5gdejlhcswjbzraadoltdpps?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Nathan Grayson (@nathangrayson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5gdejlhcswjbzraadoltdpps/post/3m7qp7qq7ck2f?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-11T23:13:36.959Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>Despite the outcry that followed the initial headlines last month, Webster said that she and other Future Class members haven’t heard a peep from Keighley or program organizers since: “Nope. Nothing.”</p><p>The protest outside The Game Awards focused on far more than just the Future Class, with pro-union and anti-CEO chants filling the air. “Our industry is dead, lay off CEOs instead,” protesters shouted at various points. “No more layoffs, no more lies, no more playing with our lives.” A pamphlet handed out by UVW members summed up the grim truth of the day: “In 2025 alone, upwards of 3,500 video game workers have lost their jobs, healthcare, and security. That number skyrockets to more than 40,000 workers when you include all tech and game workers laid off in the past three years.” </p><p>Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio, a writer and designer who also serves as UVW's local secretary, pointed to recent reporting that suggests a Game Awards trailer spot <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">can cost between $450,000 and over $1 million</a>.</p><p>"There's a lot of pomp and circumstance around it," she told Aftermath, "so we wanted to make sure that we were here representing game workers – the people who make these games – raking in millions for these executives."</p><p>This was not an entirely hassle-free process. Security attempted to prevent protesters from claiming a spot outside the theater. "We had to produce our own statutes regarding this particular terrace, which is part of LA Live," said Webster. "We also have legal council, and we had them prep the information we'd need to say 'Hey, we're allowed to be here.' Eventually, they let us in, but they were trying to turn us away."</p><p>There is a history of protests outside The Game Awards, with SAG-AFTRA leading two in <a href="https://aftermath.site/at-this-years-game-awards-nobody-won/"><u>2023</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024/"><u>2024</u></a> as part of the since-concluded voice actor strike. Members of SAG, though not representing the guild at large, were among those who attended Thursday’s protest. Sherveen Uduwana, a freelance game developer and treasurer with UVW, said others’ past efforts served as inspiration for this year’s protest.</p><p>"This is an escalation. People have shown up in previous years to push these issues forward,” Uduwana told Aftermath. “We want to make it clear to the bosses that this is not a problem they can just wait out. We're gonna be prepared to speak to these issues: mass layoffs, taking away healthcare, generative AI. And make sure we win on those issues and workers have protections."</p><p>Midway through the protest, a procession of developers gave speeches into a megaphone.</p><p>"We are the ones who poured our blood, sweat, tears, sanity, and health into these games,” shouted one who paid tribute to a friend who’d just passed, who he said loved video games and hated corporate exploitation. “The ones who made the games are outside. [Bosses and executives] are inside patting themselves on the back. ... And what was our reward? Many of us were cast aside as soon as the products were created because we weren't needed anymore. And those who were lucky enough to stay [now] find themselves debugging ChatGPT code."</p><p>Some present had direct personal experience with the video game industry’s current layoff-centric strategy. Earlier this year, Timothy Staton-Davis, who attended the protest dressed in a grim reaper cloak and holding a plastic scythe, was part of a small round of layoffs at Brass Lion Entertainment, which is currently working on <em>Wu-Tang: Rise Of The Deceiver</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“There were a few of us they had to let go of because of monetary issues,” Staton-Davis told Aftermath. “It’s their first game. They’re trying to pull through. They’ve been negatively affected by the current industry situation in a lot of ways because of mismanagement of money. It’s not the studio’s fault, but from our partners and all that kind of stuff.”</p><p>“My first studio gig was at Monolith,” he continued. “Now <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down/"><u>they’re gone</u></a>. Unfairly so. All these studios I’ve been connected to have been negatively affected in some way, shape, or form by people not doing the right things with their money and taking advantage of folks.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Colton "Anarche99" Childrey / UVW-CWA</span></figcaption></figure><p>Others were there to show solidarity.</p><p>“I’ve had so many friends affected [by layoffs],” said a developer doing organizing work with UVW named Audrey, who declined to provide their last name or place of employment, but who noted that they’ve yet to be laid off despite four years working in games. “I’m out here for the industry. I’m afraid that if I lost my job, I’m not gonna be able to find another one. The amount of power that gives our employers is just insane. I’ve had to work three crunches so far. The last one sent me to the hospital. I was in some of the most excruciating pain of my life. I thought my appendix had burst. Turns out, it was just stress.”</p><p>There are silver linings, though. Webster views UVW as a more authentic attempt at paving the way for a better games industry than Future Class ever was.</p><p>“We are disappointed in Geoff,” she said. “We are building the future of the games industry with or without his branding, and if he wants to join us, he can anytime.”</p><p>“UVW as an organization, a lot of the stuff that benefits Future Class members – whether it’s visibility or financial support or community – we have resources to also do all those things,” added Uduwana. “We’re looking to actually be able to make that kind of tangible change that The Game Awards and Geoff have shirked the responsibility of.”</p><p>“They decided that’s too hard,” said Webster, “so we’ve gotta do it ourselves.”</p><p>Webster and Uduwana also noted that as of now, UVW boasts 560 members.</p><blockquote>"I’m afraid that if I lost my job, I’m not gonna be able to find another one. The amount of power that gives our employers is just insane."</blockquote><p>"The main thing [UVW] has done for me so far is build connections – and not in a controlled forum, where we can actually be honest and have real conversations about the industry," said Aubrey. "Especially as a queer person, companies will have affinity groups and stuff like that, but HR is always there. If you say something too out there, you never know. You can't be too honest in those spaces."</p><p>Emma Kidwell, one of the Future Class members who ultimately forced an answer about the program’s fate out of The Game Awards, likes what she’s seen so far of UVW.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think UVW-CWA and the solidarity they've shown the [Future Class] alumni has been really great," Kidwell told Aftermath. "They're doing good, important work and using their platform to make the industry a better place."</p><p>In addition to supporting UVW, Staton-Davis is taking matters into his own hands. This year he opened a worker-owned studio called <a href="https://melanatedgamekitchen.itch.io/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Melanated Game Kitchen</u></a>.</p><p>“I’m also trying to contribute to the work of a more sustainable, equitable industry by starting a co-op studio myself,” he said. “We focus on fun gameplay, obviously, but narratives as well that tell cultural stories. It’s BIPOC-led, and we’re trying to bring that to the forefront. We don’t see enough of those stories in the industry, so we want to do more of that – and collaborate with everyone else who’s also trying to do that same thing.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley/"><div><p>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results [Update] - Aftermath</p><p>This year The Game Awards introduced a new distinction: “Game Changer,” which went to Amir Satvat for his efforts to help laid-off workers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Rockstar's firing of 34 workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">(31 at its Rockstar North studio in Scotland, 3 in Canada at Rockstar Toronto)</a> has been the big topic of conversation around the studio at a time when it realistically should be more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">why Grand Theft Auto VI was delayed</a>. While Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">alleges that the fired workers were distributing and discussing confidential information</a>, the fired workers, the IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain) and other Rockstar employees <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-workers-union-fires-back-again-at-rockstar-gta-6-maker-attempt-to-downplay-controversial-firings">deny these allegations</a>, claiming the fired workers were simply discussing work policies.</p>



<p>Since the dismissal of the 34 workers was made public last month, there have been demonstrations at Rockstar and Take-Two offices across the world, most <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">notably at Rockstar North in Edinburgh</a> and at Take-Two offices in Paris, London, and New York. On Friday, December 12, that stretched to Canada, where a small group of protestors, comprising representatives from the Communications Workers of America Canada (CWA Canada), local game developers, academics, and labour organizers, braved the cold to protest and make their presence known at Rockstar Toronto.</p>



<p>And make themselves known they did, as the small group of seven, not including myself and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/author/jonathan-ore-1.3300194">CBC's Jonathan Ore</a>, who were the only two press representatives there, "<em>Definitely caused a bit of a stir at the office</em>." That's how Declan Peach, a local game developer and former IWGB organizer who now works and lives in Toronto, described the demonstration to me on the train ride back into the city from Oakville.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Declan Peach at the Oakville GO transit station ahead of the demonstration.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>The fact that they closed the blackout blinds, I think, suggests that it was effective,</em>" added Felan Parker, professor of media studies at the University of Toronto, whose research and teaching mostly relate to the video game industry, and who was also in attendance to show solidarity with the fired workers.</p>



<p>I followed and spoke to the group of protestors at the Oakville GO transit station in Oakville, a town within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), at midday on Friday, as they made the short walk from the station to Rockstar Toronto, putting up posters along the way, going to the studio with the intention of delivering some literature outlining their solidarity for those fired workers.</p>



<p>The CWA Canada representatives, Katherine Lapointe and Nasr Ahmed, had <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/events/solidarity-picket-for-fired-rockstar-workers?source=direct_link&amp;">set up this demonstration as a show of solidarity</a>. Following the protest, Ahmed spoke to Ore and me together about why he and Lapointe were there and the message they wanted this action to send.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Nasr Ahmed glueing a poster to a pole along the path from the Oakville GO transit station towards Rockstar Toronto.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>When CWA Canada and CWA's direct-join video game workers union, <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/">United Video Game Workers</a>, had heard about what had happened at Rockstar, we wanted to throw our full weight, our full solidarity behind these workers. But to also show the workers on the inside that they cannot simply discipline workers for talking about working conditions without a response from the broader community."</em></p>



<p>Of the 34 fired workers, only three are based here in Canada; the other 31 are all based in the UK, and all of them are part of the unionization effort growing at Rockstar. Ahmed told us that the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto were not actively engaging in efforts to unionize their studio, but that they were fired because they were "<em>caught up</em> <em>in this</em>" with the other 31, "<em>simply for being in the UK-based organizing Discord</em>."</p>



<p>Even if the three fired workers from Rockstar Toronto weren't actively engaging in getting their studio unionized, their involvement in that server suggests that they at least want to be in proximity to organizing efforts. Although they would not be involved in any of the UK efforts, it would make sense for them to be part of the UK-based Discord server to gain knowledge as to how they may want to lead their own organizing efforts, if that was indeed the reason they were involved in the server in the first place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-3-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Declan Peach holding a CWA Canada flag.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>And that was the case, according to one of the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto, who spoke to Wccftech under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. They confirmed their involvement in the Discord server<em> </em>they described as being run "<em>by and for employees</em>," and confirmed that the founding members were all members of the IWGB. "<em>We were there mostly to talk about working conditions. Sometimes we would socialize, but the only reason we would ever be there was to discuss working conditions among the studio. I will also mention that we had a very thorough vetting process."</em> </p>



<p>(A note on the server, I asked the source about reports that there were employees who remained in the server after leaving Rockstar. The source told me that if there were people still in the server after having left the company, they had "<em>no idea</em>" of their presence, adding, "<em>everyone I've ever spoken to [in that server] was a current employee</em>.")</p>



<p>As far as the source knew, there had been no previous efforts at Rockstar Toronto to unionize. They joined the UK-based server to discuss working conditions and, one day, hopefully, see a union form at Rockstar Toronto and at every Rockstar studio.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-6-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors outside of Rockstar Toronto</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While they did not lay direct claims of union-busting by Rockstar as others have, the source admitted that "<em>The only common link between anyone who was fired is being a member of this community, and this community had the explicit</em> <em>purpose of trying to unionize all of the studios, at some point. The focus was on the UK, but the goal was to unionize all of the studios, so it has to be connected to that in some way, just because that's the only common link</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It is definitely connected with that server in some way,"</em> the source added.<em> We've never discussed any product details there; all we ever discussed was our working conditions [in that server]</em>. <em>So it has to be connected to that in some way, because that is the only common link</em>."</p>



<p>Whether they intended to organize an immediate effort at Rockstar Toronto or not, they should not be fired for simply being close to unionization efforts, and Ahmed, like the IWGB, rejects the allegations of gross misconduct from Rockstar management entirely.</p>



<p>"<em> The official story from management is that they were, quote unquote, leaking sensitive information</em>," Ahmed said. "<em> But we know that this is patently false.</em> <em> They [Rockstar] have not provided any proof for these claims,</em>  <em>either for the Canadian workers or the UK workers. At the end of the day, discussing workers' rights and discussing working conditions is not against the law as far as I know, in either Canada or in the UK, which is exactly what these workers were doing.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-7-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Ahmed and Lapointe admitted that part of why they chose December 12 for the demonstration was because they had been tipped off that employees would be having a team lunch that day, and could likely see the protestors from the windows.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When I asked the fired worker from Rockstar Toronto about the details of their dismissal, they described a similar situation to what we've previously heard about how the firings took place in the UK.</p>



<p>"<em>I was fired on October 30, 2025. The process was about the same as what you've heard from all the other UK people. They brought us into a room, we were told by an HR person there that we had broken the non-disclosure agreement and broken social media policy. Anyone in the UK or in Canada who chose to, not necessarily push back, but anyone who chose to question and press for evidence was refused, they [Rockstar] said that they couldn't give anyone any evidence, and then they didn't let anyone collect their things, they just gave them their essentials and shipped them home in an Uber</em>."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-12-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: A poster put up by the protestors, strategically placed along the path from the Oakville GO station to Rockstar Toronto.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To the source's recollection, Rockstar also declined to say why it could not provide evidence of the alleged misconduct. When I asked them directly as to whether Rockstar's claims of discussing and distributing confidential information had any truth to them, the source said, "<em>If there is, I am not aware of it; moreover, I would like them to show what there is, because when I read that, I was just confused as to what they were referring to."</em></p>



<p>When we arrived at the very unassuming building where Rockstar Toronto commands the third floor, two security guards, one of whom identified themselves as part of Rockstar's security and not part of the building's operational security team, allowed us inside the building, but prevented us from taking the elevator upstairs. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-10-Edit.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: A Rockstar security guard (green jacket) and someone who identified themselves as the facilities manager (red plaid shirt), preventing members of the protesting party from heading to the third floor to deliver the letters they brought.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>This is a haphazard attempt by Rockstar management to try and curb this," </em>Ahmed said about Friday's events<em>. "But we know that they're not going to be able to curb this because this wave of organizing is not just a wave, it's a tidal wave. It's hitting the sector fast, and it's hitting them hard, and, you know, I'm really disappointed that Rockstar is not welcoming efforts to organize with open arms,</em> <em>like some other companies have been so far</em>."</p>



<p>One of the protesting party members, Erin Carr, executive director of the <a href="https://www.solidarityplace.ca/">Solidarity Place Worker Education Centre</a> in Hamilton, who was there on his day off to support the fired workers and his longtime friend Ahmed, was one of the only two members of the protest who made it up to the third floor to try and deliver the letters.</p>



<p>"<em>They were sort of nice enough,</em>" Carr told us about the reception they got once they both made it to the third floor. "<em>[They were] asking us to go downstairs, and we said we would like to be able to drop off the letters outlining the workers' very valid concerns</em>."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-5-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Rockstar Toronto is located on the third floor of the building.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Carr made it clear that the confrontation did not escalate in any way and described the scene as "<em>just conversation</em>" between him, the other protesting member and someone from Rockstar who Carr assumed was a manager.</p>



<p>"<em>Once we made it up to the lobby and the, I'm assuming, manager, confronted us, you could see that the blinds were coming down. I mean, you couldn't see much through the doors, but clearly they didn't want the rest of the workers [to] know that we were outside supporting this cause</em>," he said. "<em>We were pretty firm</em> <em>in our position that, you know, if you're going to be sending someone out to take those letters, we would like to know who that person is, what their position is,</em> <em>etc, etc,</em> <em>and unfortunately, we can't take your word that that's actually going to happen. So we stood firm</em>." </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-9-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: The stack of letters intended for Rockstar Toronto employees left at the bottom of the Christmas tree that decorated the office building's lobby.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>No one from Rockstar Toronto was sent to retrieve the letters, and no one else from the party made it to the third floor. With the building's holiday decorations already up, the party opted to leave the stack of letters under the Christmas tree standing next to the elevator. What happened to the letters afterwards is currently unclear.</p>



<p>The group then stood outside the building and across the street, and chanted "<em>Say sorry! Be nice! Stand up for workers' rights!</em>" for a short time before heading home. Overall, it wasn't a particularly grand demonstration, but it did accomplish one of the goals Ahmed said were part of the day's effort.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-Chanting-Video.mov"></video><figcaption><em>Protestors outside of Rockstar Toronto chant "Say sorry, be nice, stand up for workers' rights!"</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>I think there's multiple goals with this demonstration. Number one, and maybe most importantly, is showing solidarity with those workers that were impacted in the UK, where it was a very blatant form of union-busting, where those</em> <em>30-plus workers were directly engaged in trying to form a union.</em>"</p>



<p><em>"As far as my understanding goes, there is an active case in the UK trying to take Rockstar to court, and right now, there are solidarity efforts outside Rockstar locations all across the world. As far as I know, it's been happening in Edinburgh, in London, in Paris, and most recently in New York. And we wanted to show them that this anger that they [Rockstar] have caused</em> <em>is global, and that includes here in the Greater Toronto Area as well."</em></p>



<p>"<em>But secondary, amongst this, we want to show those workers on the inside of that building that Rockstar is not able to do whatever they want without a response from the broader gaming community. So I can't say that this will necessarily be the last action, but it's certainly the first</em>."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-8-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors in the lobby of the office building where Rockstar Toronto is located.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>And they definitely showed that they are there, and that they are willing to show up and support these workers. Like their 31 colleagues at Rockstar North, the three workers fired at Rockstar Toronto would like to be reinstated, Ahmed confirmed. "<em>Let's be clear,</em> <em>these are workers who love what they do. When workers engage in union organizing, it's not to burn down the studio, it's to make the studio better</em>," he said.</p>



<p>"<em>It's to make the games that they create, that they put their heart and souls into, better in the long run. Oftentimes, management does not have the betterment of the games in mind. When they go and do their day-to-day practices, it's usually for shareholder value. These workers, on the other hand, that's not their main goal.</em> <em>Their main goal is to put out the best product possible. And for those reasons, these workers would love to have their jobs back</em>."</p>



<p>The anonymous source confirmed that they had knowledge of the demonstration ahead of it taking place, and while they don't know how the studio reacted to it internally on the day, they said they appreciated the show of support, particularly because they and their fired colleagues could not be out there themselves. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-4-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: The office building where Rockstar Toronto employees work on the third floor.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>Honestly, it made me happy to see that there was support for us, that there was a lot of people who cared about our situation enough to try and advocate for us. It made me feel nice that there were people advocating for us when none of us could have been there to advocate for ourselves, and it felt empowering to see the community all rally behind us."</em></p>



<p>Which was honestly one of the biggest takeaways from the protest. Again, it wasn't a big demonstration; the protestors did not stand outside chanting for hours, nor were they a particularly large group. But they were all there because they felt it was important to be there, to stand up in advocacy for those who can't do it themselves, because they felt it was the right thing to do, and, especially for everyone present that day who works in video games, they all know how vulnerable they are if they don't advocate for their rights.</p>



<p>"<em>There needs to be some addressing of the issue of the power disparity between a huge workforce of people who are super desperate to get a job in their passion," </em>said Jim Munroe, co-creator of Toronto Games Week, who was there to support the fired workers.<em> "Games is a passion-based industry, and if you don't have any guardrails or any ways of dealing with this power differential between the people who are in charge of hiring and firing and the people who are doing the work, you get a lot of abuses that just happen naturally.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-13-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors stand in front of the sign indicating where Rockstar Toronto is located in the building.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>So there needs to be some way to address it. Unions are one way, and I think it's a good thing to start</em> <em>seeing in this time, especially when the precarity of tech workers at large is really being made apparent by the enormous amount of layoffs, as the bosses are kind of drooling at the idea of replacing people with server farms running AI</em>."</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that when I asked Munroe, Parker, and Peach as we took the GO train back into the city, if they were there supporting workers they directly knew at Rockstar Toronto, they admitted that they didn't know anyone currently working at the studio. Fighting to protect the rights of people you don't even know is one of the strongest shows of community support, and exactly what this kind of effort is about.</p>



<p>"<em>I've known people who have worked, gotten burnt out, and left that particular</em> <em>studio,</em>" Munroe added, though he admitted he did not know anyone currently working at Rockstar Toronto. "<em>I mean, there's an enormous amount of churn of people, not just at Rockstar, but in the triple-A</em> <em>game studio</em> <em>world in general. It's not surprising, but in general, I do identify with the people who work really hard to get into a position where they get to do their dream job, getting there and feeling like 'Oh, there are lots of amazing things about it, but there's also weird dynamics in the workplace that can really make them feel repressed and unlikely to want to speak out, because their livelihood is depending on it now</em>."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-14.png"></a><figcaption><em>Protests have been happening in front of Rockstar buildings across the globe since the 34 workers were fired. Image credit: IWGB</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ahmed also made the case that labour issues in the video game industry is something all Canadians should be rallying behind, which is why a letter campaign has been underway to try and make local politicians aware of what's happening, similar to how local UK politicians have spoken up. Ahmed told us there has been no response as of yet, but that they have over 300 signatures after only starting the campaign days before the demonstration this past Friday.</p>



<p>"<em>At the end of the day, these are companies that are taking millions of dollars in taxpayer money in incentives, right? These are highly subsidized studios that are setting up shop not only in Ontario but all across the country, because multiple provincial have set up environments for these companies to grow and be subsidized to set up shops here. At the end of the day, if you're going to be taking Canadian taxpayer dollars, you have to respect Canadian jobs, and right now, Rockstar is showing that they are not respecting Canadian jobs, and that is our message to these politicians, whether they are Conservative, Liberal, or New Democrat</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>If politicians want to be sure that their constituents are protected as these companies are being bought and sold at this dizzying pace, then they need to have a voice at work. They need to have a seat at that table while these big international moves are being made</em>."</p>

<p>As for what's next for the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto, our source indicated that they were considering legal action, but due to the differences between UK employment law and employment law in Ontario, they were opting to "<em>wait and see</em>" how the situation continues to unfold before filing anything similar to what has happened in the UK. But of course, they'd rather not have to do any of that.</p>



<p>"<em>We just want our jobs back, man,</em>" the source told me with an exasperated breath. "<em>We poured our souls into this game, we loved our team, we loved our work. We poured our souls into this game, and we discussed our working conditions amongst ourselves because we believe in the potential of what Rockstar is. They've shown a willingness to change in the past, and because of that, I believe that they have the potential to be a leader in the games industry, in terms of what is good for workers. They've shown they can change in the past; they can change again." </em></p>



<p>"<em>We've poured our heart and soul into this project, and we just want to get back to work and keep going at it because we were good at what we did. Every single one of us was talented;</em> <em>we wouldn't have gotten into Rockstar if we weren't talented, if they didn't see our potential, if they didn't see how talented and how good we are at what we do, we wouldn't have gotten in in the first place. We just want to get back to work on the game. We poured our heart and soul into</em> <em>it, and to be let go just for discussing our working conditions amongst ourselves and wanting the company to be better, it's heartbreaking</em>."</p>



<p>Wccftech reached out to Rockstar for a comment on the protest, but did not receive a reply in time for publication.</p>

            <p>
I do not know if a black hole is something we should feed. Ostensibly they are things (anti-things? I'm not a black holeologist) that I would like to be far away from, given what I've heard. And yet here I am, having tinkered around with the demo for A Game About Feeding A Black Hole, which is a game about feeding a black hole, left with the feeling that this is not only a thing I can do, but find tranquility in.
</p>
<p>
The thing about A Game About Feeding A Black Hole is that it is more or less what it says on the tin. It is also a game about inaction and reaction. You have a tiny circle which every second or so, to start with, does a bit of damage. So, you break down the handful of asteroids you see around you, their remnants being swept up in the nothingness that is the black hole, trying to increase its size as the clock counts down.

<p>
This then gives you money, money which you can spend on a skill tree, a skill tree that can grow your circle, or strengthen it, or increase the length of the timer, or increase the mass of certain asteroids, or make some of them shoot out forks of lightning, or turn some of them radioactive, all of which works in tandem with one another. As your skills increase, so does your ability to destroy asteroids and feed the black hole, growing it in size incrementally. This is one of the reactions, as well as how a lightning bolt might hit another asteroid helping to destroy it, even more effectively on the radioactive rocks.
</p><p>
The inaction is the fact that all you really do is move your mouse around. After a while, in the demo, the game does half of the work for you, but oh that sweet satisfaction of seeing a plethora of numbers and destroyed bits of space boulders flying into deep, dark, nothingness. This is a game to spend perhaps 15 minutes on, the kind of thing you might do on a cigarette break during your shift at the busiest brunch spot in town, a way to get away and calm yourself down.
</p>
<p>
A Game About Feeding A Black Hole is also a game that came out today, December 15th, so for the price of a fancy pastry, you could instead, well… you know. It's available to pick up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3694480/A_Game_About_Feeding_A_Black_Hole/">here</a>.

  </picture><p>The game focused on risk management and negotiation. Up to five players took on the role of criminals executing a series of heists. The Kickstarter campaign launched about four months ago and was fully funded with more than 8,700 followers. However, in the latest update post on the campaign, Leder Games' founder, Patrick Leder, stated the following:</p><blockquote><p>“Take’s designer, Ted, has decided to move on from the studio and onto his next grand adventure. He will be bringing Take with him. Due to this, we are cancelling this crowdfunding campaign. We wish him the very best!</p><p>“As for the future of Take, that is squarely in the designer’s hands. We enjoyed our play tests in the studio, and will certainly celebrate if/when Ted takes that next step toward production.</p><p>“We are grateful for the enthusiasm you’ve all shown for Take. Nearly 8,700 followers is nothing to sneeze at! We look forward to returning to Kickstarter in the future with another amazing project. Stay tuned!”</p></blockquote><p>What this means for the <em>Take</em> board game is unclear. If you backed the original Kickstarter, you will need to contact Leder Games about a refund. But, there is a chance that the board game may return elsewhere, just not as it was sold under Leder Games.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-strix-g16-laptop-with-rtx-5070-1tb-ssd-and-ryzen-9-hits-new-low-amazon-cuts-all-profit-margin-2000653501</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Serious gamers demand hardware that won’t bottleneck their competitive edge or compromise visual fidelity when maxed-out settings matter most. The <strong>Asus ROG Strix G16</strong> (2025 edition) targets this exact audience with bleeding-edge components that few laptops currently offer, including the brand-new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU powered by Blackwell architecture.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6404/">is offering this powerhouse for $1,699 right now, marked down from its $2,099 list price</a>, hitting a record low just before Christmas arrives. This represents one of the rare gaming laptops shipping with the <strong>RTX 5070</strong> and gives early adopters access to DLSS 4 technology and next-generation ray tracing performance that won’t become mainstream for months. The combination of <strong>AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9955HX processor, 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, 1TB SSD and a 240Hz display</strong> creates a no-compromise gaming machine built for competitive esports and demanding AAA titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6404/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Changes the Game for Mobile Gaming</h2>
<p>The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 is a big step forward in technology and its Blackwell architecture makes ray tracing and AI-powered frame generation through DLSS 4 much better. DLSS 4’s multi-frame generation can make games run three times faster by making up to three AI frames for every traditionally rendered frame and it can effectively triple frame rates in games that support it. Max-Q technologies improve power efficiency without lowering performance which means that the RTX 5070 can deliver desktop-class gaming in a portable form factor that doesn’t use up battery life right away.</p>



<p>The AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor has a Zen 5 architecture with a lot of cores and boost clocks that go over 5GHz and gives the CPU the power it needs to keep GPU bottlenecks from happening in competitive games. This processor can handle background tasks like streaming, Discord, and playing music without slowing down games which makes it perfect for content creators who game or streamers who need encoding power. The DDR5-5600 memory runs faster than the DDR4 memory from the previous generation and lowers latency and raises bandwidth for games that use a lot of memory and for multitasking.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD loads things so quickly that you only have to wait a few seconds between matches or loading screens. This drive has enough space for your operating system and important apps, as well as modern games like Starfield or Baldur’s Gate 3 that require more than 100GB to install. PCIe Gen 4 speeds can reach up to 7,000MB/s for sequential reads and makes asset streaming smooth and almost completely stops texture pop-in, which is a problem with slower storage solutions.</p>



<p>The ROG Nebula Display has a 2560×1600 resolution and a 16:10 aspect ratio which means it has more vertical screen space than standard 16:9 panels, but it still has the same pixel density needed for clear images. The<strong> 240Hz refresh rate and 3ms response time</strong> get rid of motion blur and ghosting in fast-paced shooting or racing games where every millisecond counts. The new ACR film technology makes contrast ratios better and glare less, so the display can be used in brighter places without reflections washing out darker scenes.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Cooling system from ROG <strong>uses tri-fan technology, a full-width heatsink, and well-placed vents</strong> to get rid of heat without making noise like a jet engine. The advanced thermal design keeps the CPU and GPU from getting too hot during long gaming sessions, which would slow down performance if it weren’t for it. Cooler parts also make hardware last longer because high temperatures over time cause parts to wear out faster.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 laptop is now at a price point where it competes with last-generation RTX 4070 machines that can’t match the Blackwell architecture’s performance improvements. Most gaming laptops with similar specs cost between $2,200 and $2,600, so this Asus deal is very good for cutting-edge hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie has released a new ViDoc for their upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, confirming a new release window for the game, changes that have been made <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">since the delay</a>, and setting a price.</p>
<p>Marathon will now launch in March 2026 for PS5 and PC, and it comes with a $39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99 price tag.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon - Bungie ViDoc: Vision of Marathon | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4J91kh56jiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the game’s delay earlier this year, Bungie has been playtesting in private and gathering more feedback, making the following changes to the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity chat is now featured in the game</li>
<li>Rook is a new solo scavenger character type</li>
<li>Solo Runner queue</li>
<li>Updates to visual fidelity across the board</li>
</ul>
<p>These are really key changes, given the success and popularity of Arc Raiders. Proximity chat that enables collaboration with other players ad hoc has greatly shaped the gaming community within that extraction shooter, and having a solo queue has enabled distinct playstyles.&nbsp;The Rook character shell is specifically designed to enable you to join matches in progress, coming in with less gear but more potential to quickly scavenge and get out.</p>

<p>Also important is the change to the visuals, which will allow for dead runner bodies to remain in the world, adding a darker layer to the sci-fi visuals.</p>
<p>All of this is good (and so too is a price point that matched Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders), but we’ll have to wait and see if this helps the game come out from under the long shadow cast by its aborted announcement earlier this year. The game’s public testing and the reaction to this went so badly that Sony and Bungie had to pull back to avoid another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>-like disaster. Bungie has also been under pressure with Destiny 2, the company enduring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">rounds of layoffs</a> last year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, and some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/15/bungie-finally-admit-they-messed-up-destiny-2-and-are-going-to-make-changes/">underwhelming reactions to the Edge of Fate</a> expansion this year, which they’ve finally admitted was a misstep and will work to rectify.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Less than two years after it debuted, Amazon’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2s-first-real-trailer-is-here-and-its-bonkers-2000644032"><em>Fallout</em> TV show</a> is back with season 2, and even earlier than originally promised. New episodes will now kick off a whole 24 hours earlier than previously planned. The company used the Las Vegas sphere to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSShMHRkmpY/">reveal the reverse-delay</a>.</p> <p>Originally set to launch on December 17, 2025, <em>Fallout</em> season 2 will now begin streaming on December 16 at 9:00 p.m. ET instead. New episodes will be released weekly, with the latest batch wrapping up on February 4, 2026. Walton Goggins’ Ghoul, Ella Purnell’s vault dweller, and Brotherhood of Steel squire Aaron Moten will return as the show moves the focus to New Vegas, the subject of the critically acclaimed video game spin-off by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>   <p>Season 2 adds Macaulay Culkin in an unknown role and Justin Theroux as Mr. House, the guy in charge of New Vegas. It’s unclear exactly how Lucy and the Ghoul’s roundtrip through the desert will unfold, but the show has already <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-season-2-tv-show-new-vegas-location-deathclaw/">teased Deathclaws</a> and other big monsters making brief cameos. Will we see some Super Mutants too?</p> <p>The show seems likely to wade even more deeply into wasteland conspiracies and factional disputes, but none of it will be resolved in the eight upcoming episodes. Amazon has already renewed <em>Fallout</em> for season 3, and probably will make as many more as showrunner Jonathan Nolan is able to give them. Remember, <em>Fallout</em> isn’t on Netflix or HBO. You’ll need a Prime subscription to watch. Or the password to your friend’s account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Truth be told, I haven't played all that many games this year, who has the time! There was one I couldn't miss out on, however, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, the first properly new entry in the series for many years, and one with some pedigree behind it, Higurashi and Umineko writer Ryukishi07. I ended up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">reviewing it</a> for this here site, and liked it very much then, and perhaps more now. There were some great lessons to be learned, and in a recent interview, Ryukishi07 put some of those lessons into succinct, quite lovely words.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/silent-hill-f-writer-knows-you-dont-really-want-to-see-a-happily-ever-after-and-the-games-horrific-portrayal-of-young-womanhood-makes-it-my-goty/">GamesRadar</a>, the writer spoke of how each of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's characters, not just protagonist Hinako, but her parents, her friends, and the mysterious Fox Mask "may have had their own hell. Please do not forget that, or the fact that Hinako was oblivious to those hells, as she was too consumed by her own personal hell to notice." He continued to note how your own personal hell is "a world of solitude that no one else can perceive, but please do not fall into the trap of assuming that others around you have no hell of their own."
</p>
<p>
It's later on in the interview where Ryukishi07 says what I find most heartwarming, a strange feeling to have with something like Silent Hill. He discusses how he wants people to believe that whatever form of hell a person might be experiencing, it will come to an end one day. And according to him, "the key to the way out of your personal hell lies in the hands of your family, friends, or your local hotlines. You have endured through your personal hell so much. You have already persevered enough, so please, be proud of yourself, and rely on the help of others."
</p>
<p>
The hotlines part is possibly a touch hokey, but the overall spirit of the message is one I appreciate deeply. It is a message that is well woven into the game itself, and is borderline Kingdom Heartsian in its nature, a series that is perhaps diametrically opposed to Silent Hill in almost every regard. The feeling of comradery between Hinako and Shu is one of the best elements of the game, and it's reassuring to see the powerful narrative of the two relying on one another wasn't just a fluke.
</p><p>
I'd really recommend the full reader over at GamesRadar, as long as you're alright with some spoilers. I had little faith in Silent Hill f, and was proven wrong, so to see the love with which Ryukishi07 speaks of his creation is just nice to see.

</p>

On Steam, the game reached a peak over the weekend of 56,993 players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to SteamDB</a>.

They're up 76% on Steam, 21% on PS5, and 3% on Xbox (where it's available on Game Pass). Alinea's estimate is that this amounts to over 200,000 more copies sold in just a few days.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/15/bafkreig3wwiueo7cpgfejnsw5o3sdym5rqer4tcx7j6wddi4kdn7hyvsey-1765831179743.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But returning players are also coming back. Mat Piscatella, senior director at Circana, said that "the percent of US active PS, XBX and US Steam players engaging with the game more than tripled by Dec 13th when compared to Dec 10th. US Steam showed the largest lift," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7zxuzbclk2f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a Bluesky post</a>. Piscatella affirmed that this was the highest total of players engaged on Steam since June 1, with Xbox in the US seeing its highest total since June 27, and PlayStation in the US since June 10th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an incredible spike no matter how you look at it, reflecting both those playing for the first time as well as returning players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-dlc-is-out-now-the-game-awards">giving the free DLC</a> a shot. It's likely that its run of awards had something to do with this, especially since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">one of those awards was Game of the Year</a>.

Zeal is back as well, as are powerful auras, a defining feature of the class from Diablo 2. There are four main ways to build the Paladin in Diablo 4, each represented by the class's unique Oaths mechanic.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The Zealot Oath focuses on unrelenting offense based around the iconic Zeal ability from Diablo 2, encouraging players to stack attack speed and crit chance.</li><li dir="ltr">For those looking to stand their ground and become a fortress unto themselves, the Juggernaut Oath allows for a tank playstyle that focuses on shield-based abilities and overwhelming defense.</li><li dir="ltr">The flashiest of the bunch, the Judicator Oath revolves around huge area-of-effect holy damage, applying Judgement to enemies and detonating those marks to huge effect.</li><li dir="ltr">Last but not least, the Disciple Oath sees players temporarily transform into an angelic Arbiter, granting special buffs and dealing damage to nearby enemies. Those who choose this oath will seek to stay in Arbiter form for as long as possible to take advantage of its various buffs and enhanced mobility.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">I'm sure there will be creative builds that combine a number of different skills and philosophies that don't strictly fit into one of the four playstyles above, but that's a general overview of the class. Like I said before, I wished the Paladin had a little more Diablo 2-flavor. Many of its abilities, particularly its various shield-based abilities like Shield Charge, Blessed Shield, Shield Bash, as well as skills like Condemn and Consecration, are all straight from Crusader.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, Diablo 4's Paladin feels like two classes in one. For those who wish to relive the days of Diablo 2, the Zealot Oath and abilities like Fanaticism Aura and Zeal feel like the most direct throughline between the two games. The Judicator playstyle also brings in some Diablo 2 flavor with Blessed Hammers and its Holy Light aura (which can be converted into fire damage with a new Unique item, essentially turning it into Diablo 2's Holy Fire aura).</p><p dir="ltr">The other two Oath playstyles, however, are more Crusader-coded. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as Crusader itself shares a significant amount of Paladin DNA. In Diablo 4, the shield-focused Juggernaut Oath, as well as some of the class' more over-the-top holy abilities, feel the most like Crusader.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnvWkUIA8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IfnvWkUIA8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Disciple skills are in some ways the odd-ones-out. While some Disciple skills are taken directly from Diablo 3, like Condemn and Falling Star (very similar to the Crusader's Falling Sword), the class' Arbiter transformation is functionally fairly different from its closest Crusader comparison, Akarat's Champion. Of the four playstyles, the Disciple Oath is the one that feels the most original to this particular version of sword-and-board-wielding holy knight, even if it does feature a number of abilities directly inspired by Crusader.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of which playstyle you go with, you can rest assured that Diablo 4's Paladin does kick some serious ass. Its synergies are easy to understand and take advantage of, and that more straightforward nature (especially compared to the more complicated previous new class, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">Spiritborn</a>) makes Paladin a great class for those diving into Diablo 4 for the first time or returning after a long hiatus. Every ability looks and feels powerful, and Blizzard has done a fantastic job delivering on that holy-knight-in-shining-armor fantasy that was so desperately missing from Diablo 4 up until this point.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's second expansion, Lord of Hatred, releases April 28. We recently sat down with Blizzard to learn more about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-brings-back-everyones-favorite-hot-mom-amazons-and-lorath/1100-6536976/" data-ref-id="1100-6536976">how Lord of Hatred will bring back fan-favorite characters</a> like Lorath and everyone's favorite "hot mom"(aka Lilith), as well as what players can expect from the expansion's new region of Skovos. Lord of Hatred will be the first time a Diablo game has ever received two expansions, and Blizzard looks to be celebrating with a second, still-to-be-revealed class. Alongside new classes, the expansion will rework skill trees for all of the game's classes, introduce a loot filter, overhaul its endgame, and bring back the franchise's iconic Horadric Cube.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony’s annual PlayStation sale has been going on for nearly a month now, offering discounts on everything from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PlayStation 5 Digital Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJT5DJ16?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PlayStation Portal</a> to Sony’s standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FY6Y9WZT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">DualSense controller</a>. However, the end of the sale is quickly approaching, with Sony’s website showing that some deals are set to expire as soon as Friday, December 19th, while others have a little more runway through December 28th. That means you don’t have much longer to sneak in a last-minute gift for yourself or someone you love.</p><div><div><h2>Featured Products</h2></div><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><p>Now through December 25th, the <strong>PS5 Digital Edition</strong> is on sale for $399 ($100 off) — its lowest price of the year — at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Digital-Console-Slim%2F17852302051" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l5nbBL/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-consoles%2Fplaystation5-digital-edition-console-825-gb" rel="sponsored">Sony’s PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. While this version is the least expensive console in Sony’s lineup, it lacks a disc drive, so games have to be downloaded. With modern titles often topping 50GB, a fast, consistent internet connection is a must. That said, you can pick up an <a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l5nbBL/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdisc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles" rel="sponsored">external disc drive</a> designed to work with the system for $79.99 if you later decide you’d rather go the physical media route.</p><p>The standard <strong>PlayStation 5 slim</strong> is also on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Disc-Console-Slim%2F17816601985" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fplaystation-5-slim-console-playstation-5%2FJXHQ3CCTYR" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> through December 25th, matching its lowest price of the year at $449 ($100 off). It’s similar to the Digital Edition and supports all of the same games, but it features a built-in disc drive, allowing you to play your stack of older PlayStation titles, the latest PS5 games, and Blu-rays right out of the box. If you prefer physical media, the PS5 is the way to go, as it’s ultimately more affordable than the combined price of a PS5 Digital Edition and Sony’s external drive.</p><p>If you want a little more oomph, you can also save on the more powerful <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> through December 25th, which is currently matching its all-time low of around $649 ($101 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE%2F11839818124" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l5nbBL/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-consoles%2Fplaystation5-pro-console" rel="sponsored">PlayStation Direct</a>. The PS5 Pro features a bigger GPU, faster memory, improved ray tracing, Wi-Fi 7 support, and AI-based upscaling. The upgraded internals let you play “PS5 Pro Enhanced” titles at higher resolutions or frame rates than on a standard PS5; however, there are no PS5 Pro-exclusive games. While we did notice some slight graphical improvements when playing games on the more powerful console, the differences were only apparent when sitting closer than 10 feet away from the TV.</p><p>The <strong>PlayStation Portal</strong> is currently down to its all-time low of $178.99 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJT5DJ16?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-Portal-Remote-Player-for-PS5-Console%2F5060699568" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-playstation-portal-remote-player-midnight-black%2FJXHQ3C2H3K%2Fsku%2F6614840" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> through December 25th. When the handheld remote player originally launched in 2023, its sole function was to remotely stream games from the PS5 via Wi-Fi. The Portal has improved since then, with Sony introducing a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814078/playstation-portal-ps5-cloud-streaming">cloud streaming feature</a> that allows PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to stream select PS5 games, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a>, directly from the cloud instead of from their console over Wi-Fi. Portal users can also stream select titles from their own library without needing to connect to their PS5 console at all, making the 8-inch device a little more versatile than it was at launch.</p><p>Now through December 19th, you can snag Sony’s <strong>DualSense Wireless Controller</strong> in select colors starting at $54 (about $21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FY6Y9WZT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Cosmic-Red%2F18264102609" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-playstation-5-dualsense-wireless-controller-midnight-black%2FJXHQ37T9XC" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The PS5 gamepad helps enhance the gaming experience with haptic vibrations and rear triggers with variable tension. The wireless controller also features a built-in speaker, gyroscope, accelerometer, and a touchpad, and it’s compatible with both macOS and Windows if you like to game on other platforms. Whereas the PS5 and Portal may not arrive in time for Christmas, Amazon says the DualSense will be ready to unwrap on the big day.</p><p>Finally, the <strong>Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</strong> have returned to around $169 ($31 off), their best price to date, at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSQSX7FB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-PULSE-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds-with-Charging-Case-for-PS5-White%2F5113283042" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-pulse-explore-wireless-gaming-earbuds-for-ps5-white%2FJXHQ3CCYGQ%2Fsku%2F6566053" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The wireless earbuds are tailor-made for Sony’s consoles, allowing you to take advantage of lossless, ultra-low-latency audio when using the PlayStation Link protocol. In our testing, the <a href="https://bloomaudio.com/blogs/articles/whats-the-difference-between-dynamic-and-planar-magnetic-drivers">planar magnetic drivers</a> delivered an audio experience that offered great clarity and separation, making it easy to distinguish small details and individual sound effects. When you’re done gaming with them, you can even pair the Pulse Explore to your phone and other Bluetooth devices, making it easy to use them as plain ol’ earbuds.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/844698/sony-ps5-playstation-portal-dualsense-controller-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Last month saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk">the release of Project Misriah</a>, an ambitious modding project that tried to re-create the feel of <em>Halo 3</em> inside Valve’s <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. That project has now been taken down from the Steam Workshop, though, after drawing a <span id="_b3hAae3XHNOj0PEPoYS8uA4_97">Digital Millennium Copyright Act </span>complaint from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Modder Froddoyo <a href="https://x.com/Froddoyo/status/1990243094311424022">introduced Project Misriah on November 16</a> as “a workshop collection of <em>Halo</em> ported maps and assets that aims to bring a <em>Halo 3</em> multiplayer-like experience to <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>.” Far from just being inspired by <em>Halo 3</em>, the mod directly copied multiple sound effects, character models, maps, and even movement mechanics from Bungie and Microsoft’s popular series.</p>
<p>In the weeks since, Project Misriah has drawn a lot of praise from both <em>Halo</em> fans and those impressed by what modders could pull off with the Source 2 engine. But last Wednesday, modder Froddoyo <a href="https://x.com/Froddoyo/status/1998833996395053070">shared a DMCA request from Microsoft</a> citing the “unauthorized use of <em>Halo</em> game content in a [Steam] workshop not associated with <em>Halo</em> games.”</p>

<p>In a social media post sharing that DMCA text, Froddoyo ruefully said that players should “make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft” for the project’s fate. But in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk&amp;lc=UgyYC9fQkPIh-iWt6454AaABAg">a comment on Project Misriah’s YouTube trailer</a>, Froddoyo noted that, following the takedown, the project “will not be worked on or uploaded in the future. But hey, it was fun while it lasted. Thank you to all of the players and supporters of [the] project. We will use the knowledge and skills obtained from this to cook up something else!”</p>

                <p>After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a "satisfying" conclusion and an "epic, final showdown" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&amp;A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of "Jedi mind tricks," and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> It's always been our intention. This is an "Age of Hatred" or Mephisto-Lilith-themed saga. Even before the base game came out--once we had finished our work on it, but before the actual release date--we were already planning out the next chapters of the story and it was always going to be about the story about Mephisto, his plans for Sanctuary, and ultimately all culminating to a final confrontation with him.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>When it comes to story, there's always things that change and it's trying to figure out what can we keep, what gets lost, and what is the streamline--especially when it comes to telling this really fun, big story. With Vessel of Hatred, we wanted to really dig into Mephisto and his motivation and keep that with Neyrelle. Now we get a chance to end it. I think it's sticking to our themes about family; that's a really big theme that we have with Mephisto and Lilith, and her children and Inarius. I think that it's finally all coming together. And that was always the plan--to have this big story that feels well-thought-out, and characters that you love and you want to fight for and want to fight against.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: And is this the final showdown?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> Yeah, this is a final showdown. We're going to see Mephisto in his full prime evil demonic glory. It's like what Eleni was talking about a little earlier: When you look at the bigger picture, you're seeing these phases of Mephisto, right? In the base game, he's very on the edges. He's not reborn yet and he's taking on the wolf form. In Vessel, he's a little more powerful because now he's in this Soulstone and he's able to do more. And so in Lord of Hatred, it's like there are no more chains on him. And although he's assuming--at first, at least--this form of Akarat, this prophet figure, he likes to manipulate people and do those sorts of things. He's using a new tool now to do that, but ultimately, the story culminates in us facing him, taking off his mask, and really just having this big epic showdown with him.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>It'll be very satisfying, I think, for the players with a lot of the story. There will be satisfaction along with horrors, and I think that's the best thing for Diablo. You've got some crazy, horrific things, and then you get this nice finale.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the Paladin and how they differ from previous games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> There've been Paladins in Diablo before as well as the Crusader, who's similar to a Paladin in many ways because they're using the light as their source of magic. The Diablo 4 Paladin is a little bit different in terms of the lore and story. Rather than coming from the Zakarum church or being part of this big religion or institution, they're of a smaller order who are independent. And they're just out in the world trying to do good. They've learned from the past that being part of these big institutions inevitably leads to corruption, so they've purposefully, intentionally gone out and said, "We're not going to get involved in that kind of stuff. We're just going to find the light within us and use that to do good out in the world." And so they have these oaths that they live by so that they don't follow the corruption and that sort of thing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Eleni Rivera: </strong>The fun part is that we get to reinvent the Paladin. While they recognize the past, they know about the Zakarum, they know about other Paladins that have existed… They get to redefine who they are, what they are, and what The Order is. <em>That's</em> who they are. They even choose a new name when they join The Order, and their name is directly connected to what they find the most important within it. It's so cool. You get a chance to see this new form of who they are.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>And what's interesting about them too is they--due to their close connection with the light--are also aware of angels and the heavens. They know that angels are beings of light. And so they don't worship angels or anything like that, but they see them as these embodiments of light and embodiments of values that are associated with the light, like valor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623175-4621567-diablo4paladinplayablenow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623175" data-ratio="0.56254467476769" data-width="1399" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623175-4621567-diablo4paladinplayablenow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623175"></a><figcaption>A Paladin gazes from beneath their blood-soaked helmet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623175-4621567-diablo4paladinplayablenow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the region that's coming with the expansion? Are there any real-life locations that inspired it, or parts of history?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Skovos is really cool, really unique, and interesting to Sanctuary. We mentioned earlier that Skovos is where Lilith, Inarius, and these other rebel angels and demons created Sanctuary, and then they hung out in Skovos. It wasn't necessarily called Skovos back then, but they lived there at the dawn of the world. This is where they created humans, or rather where they created the first humans: the Firstborn. When you think about this saga as a story of family, as Eleni said, or maybe as one about what humanity's fate is, it makes sense to bring this culmination with Mephisto to where humanity itself began. There's tons of Firstborn ruins and, sometimes, not even ruins--it's the modern-day people, the Askari. They've maintained this architecture, they live within it, and they see the Firstborn as part of their heritage in a way, even though it's distant.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot of different environments throughout these different islands. Each one of them has a unique theme and flavor. We explore a lot of the culture of this place, so you have the Amazons and you have this oracle order, this Order of Seers. We get to see how they work together and how they rule over this island nation to help it function and survive all this terrible stuff that's happening in other parts of Sanctuary.</p><p dir="ltr">But the big interesting point of conflict is that now the bad stuff that was happening in Sanctuary--the stuff that we saw in base game and Vessel of Hatred--now it's coming to Skovos. Mephisto, in the body of Akarat, has gathered a bunch of followers, he's brought them all to Skovos, and he's disrupting the order and the piece of this place. Anything you want to add to that, Eleni?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>I feel like you covered a lot of it, but it's really beautiful. It's stunning and it's a place that you haven't seen before, so I think that's really exciting. And there's just a lot to look at. There's water that you get to look at, and I know that's very small, but it's just… the environment team did a <em>really</em> good job. And in general, there's a lot of deep lore that we got a chance to explore there. I think that'll be really exciting for players who really love lore and players who are also just diving into Diablo for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: And compared to Vessel, how large is Lord of Hatred? How many hours of story can we expect?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera:</strong> I would say it's comparable to Vessel of Hatred. The map is pretty big. Like Matt said, there's a lot of lore stuff you get to explore in Skovos, so it's got quite a bit of content that the players get to dive into.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>PC Gamer: How do you approach creating a villain like Mephisto in a way that feels like a threat to the player, given that our player characters have just killed tons of demons that were already very powerful?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>It's narrative. It's understanding what a player's weakness is, right? And it's building that up and connecting the player to people like Neyrelle and Lorath. You have these stakes that get bigger and bigger because you care about them more. So when it comes to someone who's <em>so</em> powerful, or someone who can defeat all these demons, what really is the thing that will get them to crack? It's the people that they love, the people that they want to fight for, and Sanctuary. And when it comes to creating a really big villain, it's building off that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> When we first introduced [Mephisto] in the base game, part of the reason we introduced him that way is because he's not the antagonist in the story yet. We're hunting Lilith and he's helping us, and so it's creating this feeling of, "Yeah, I don't know if I should trust him or I shouldn't trust him, but he's sort of useful to me, so at what point will the usefulness wear out or will he turn the tables on me?" Because it's going to happen eventually, right? I think we wanted to introduce him that way just so that it would feel a little different than suddenly there's a prime evil sitting in front of you and you just want to fight him.</p><p dir="ltr">I mean Eleni said it perfectly: It's how his effect on the characters we care about--and on the world at large--raises the stakes. And again, we're continuing this thread of him always being a bit of a devil on our shoulder. We're not always working with the best characters--sometimes our allies are a little shifty, too. He exploits that reality. He makes us doubt, maybe sometimes our actions, and the people around us.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: How do you make side quests feel like an organic part of the story when there's literally Satan running around?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>One thing that we've done is there are a number of side quests where it's a continuation of a character story that you meet in the main campaign. There are quests that follow an important character that you're around for some amount of time, and now you get to see what has happened to them after all these big events have unfolded. Yeah, Mephisto is running around and the stakes are so high, but what's going on with these other characters? It's about showing the aftermath of those big events, or showing the repercussions of the devil running loose.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>Yeah. I mean, the main story is so specific to our main characters, but the side quests are what breathe life into Sanctuary. They show us what everybody else is doing while the world is crumbling, and seeing intimate stories--seeing what other characters who maybe we know but they're not in the main quest--I think that gives us a chance as writers to dive deeper, and gives players get the chance to understand what these people are doing while there is this chaos. Life keeps on life-ing even when you've got Mephisto running amok. And I think that's the cool part about writing side quests.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: It seems like this idea of generational trauma is really at the core of this saga. Is that something that was intentional to this story? Are there some other ideas and themes that you were really hoping to get across and explore?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Yes. One of the themes that's present throughout is this idea of the passing of the torch, or like you said, it's sort of a generational… Maybe trauma is part of it, but also how you pass on legacy, and whether you can even pass it on at all. And in passing on a legacy, what kind of burden are you putting on the new people?</p><p dir="ltr">For Lilith wanting to protect Sanctuary, or for the Horadrim wanting to do their thing, these are not easy jobs, right? They require a lot of sacrifice. Sometimes the goal is noble, but passing it on can be hard because you know that you're dooming these people to a tough life. That's definitely a theme that we played with in base game and Vessel, and also we explore in Lord of Hatred as well.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also this prophecy in the base game, and I think it shows up in Vessel of Hatred too, that Rathma had. He had these visions and saw the Great Serpent, and this is still a part of the story. As Eleni said, fate is a big theme and so is this prophecy, how it's unfolding, what it actually means, and whether it must happen or can be avoided. This thing will unfold and be fulfilled, but maybe not in the way the characters necessarily suspect. There will be a lot of sacrifices and choices made by characters that there are no coming back from. [Lord of Hatred] is going to be a big, exciting culmination of everything that started in the base game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>PC Gamer: Could you talk a little bit more about Lilith coming back to the story and what her role is? I know there are quite a few players that really, really enjoyed her in the first game.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>We all love Lilith, right? She's cool, she's hot, she's our mom. I think it's really exciting we get a chance to see her in a new way. There's a lot of intimacy that we get to have with Lilith, and I think that we've always wanted to--or at least I've always wanted to--partner up with her. But Lilith will always be a demon at the end of the day. She has her own motivations and she's always going to have her own idea of what she wants in the world. So she has to decide whether or not she wants to ally with us for this bigger problem.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>The only thing I'd add is, again, it's about bringing these different threads to a close. In the base game, we were fed Lilith's blood petals--fed her blood. She's been a part of us this whole time. And though we defeated her in Hell, something of her has lived on in us. There's a presence inside of us that is slumbering basically. And now that we're going after Mephisto and the stakes are high and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, her presence within us really becomes a key to figuring out how to stop Mephisto. Like she said in the base game, "There would be no victory without me." That sort of idea, it's true--we will need her to fix this and to save Sanctuary from Mephisto.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623176-4144537-review_diablo4_site.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623176-4144537-review_diablo4_site.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623176"></a><figcaption>Lilith poses in front of a deep-red background.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623176-4144537-review_diablo4_site.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: What inspired the decision to bring back Lilith so soon? Were you a bit worried about bringing her back or was it just something that seemed like, "Oh no, we have to do this?"</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Like when I mentioned earlier, before the base game actually released and we were planning out future stories, we always did want to bring her back. Then it became a question of when. It was about finding the right opportunity to do it and make it feel the most impactful to the story.</p><p dir="ltr">During [Vessel of Hatred's] development, we were toying around with the idea. We actually made some of these scenes where you heard her speaking. There was a scene where you saw her reflection or something like that too, but we cut those things out of Vessel because we were just trying to figure out, "Okay, where's the place where we should highlight that so that it feels like something really juicy and impactful and not just a little thing that happens and then there's no payoff for it yet?" You know what I mean?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>I feel like one of the biggest things is deciding how much payoff we want. We talk a lot about how this expansion is going to be super satisfying and everything will feel like it's tied together. Vessel of Hatred was the story of Neyrelle, it was <em>a</em> story of Mephisto, and it was about seeing what he could do without the power of being in Sanctuary. Now that he's out, it's seeing what he's going to do with this free will back in Sanctuary but masked as this major religious figure.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>One fun thing we're doing in Lord of Hatred that we didn't really do before is, with Lilith, you have different dialogue options for how you want to respond to her about certain things. We know that people have different feelings for her--whether she was right, whether she was wrong or whether they would've wanted to join her or not--and so we wanted to explore that through some of the dialogue you can have with her. Now, you get to see different ways she'll respond to you as well based on your decisions.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>I feel like Lilith is so nuanced and so complex. You get a mix of seduction and horror all at the same time and it's so cool and fun. And now we get a chance to really see her in a different way. When we last saw her we were fighting against her, but now there's a bigger issue. There's more at stake here, so it's her deciding what's important to her.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: You brought up that you now have options for how you want to interact with Lilith, and I thought that was really interesting because, right now, choice-driven, branching CRPGs are becoming more of the standard in the industry. Is that something that you've ever thought about exploring with Diablo? Having more choice throughout the story, exploring maybe different endings, different stories, and branching paths? Is that even possible in the structure of the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> I think it's cool and I enjoy that kind of stuff too. For Lord of Hatred, it's more in line with the base game and Vessel of Hatred. We don't do that kind of branching stuff. The choices I mentioned earlier, there's a number of places in the campaign where you have these different options of what to say, or how someone might respond to you, but it's more about giving the moment some interesting flavor. It's about allowing you to imagine your own story in this--who you are, your choices, or your opinion about something. It's giving you an opportunity to say it out loud, basically, even though it doesn't necessarily create a branched quest or storyline based on that. It's just about that opportunity of expression for your character or for some of the other characters too.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>That's why we do it sometimes in side quests. It's not like you have two different paths, but I do think we get to explore a little bit of that. There was a side quest from, I think in Vessel of Hatred, that you get to have an alternate ending based on what you choose.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: Romance options? That's all I got.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Blizzard PR representative: </strong>Are you asking, "Can we hook up with Lilith?"</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: It's what everybody's thinking.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera:</strong> In terms of romance, we get to see a little bit of Lorath's past, which is something that we haven't really gotten a chance to see with other characters. He has interactions with Queen Adriana that we get to see. We also get to see a lot more of Lorath, how he was painted in the past, and who he was versus who he's become now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>PC Gamer: Is Lorath back? Are we going to hear more Ralph Ineson?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Yeah, Lorath is one of the main characters in the expansion. He's going to be with you almost all the time throughout the campaign, except the times you split up and you're off doing different things, right? But yeah, he's there, he's continuing his story. There's a lot about Lorath and the Horadrim in Lord of Hatred. And again, it goes back to the themes of legacy and the fate of the Horadrim.</p><p dir="ltr">We've been in VO sessions with Ralph recording all of his lines, and it's always great to hear his voice again. The moment you hear it, you're like, "Oh yeah, it's Lorath." That's been really fun and I'm super excited about Lorath's story in Lord of Hatred. I think it has a lot of great moments. He's a lot of fun to write as a character and, again, Ralph's voice is just amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">Another thing is Lorath has a history in Skovos, and that's something we'll explore in the campaign but, years and years ago, he came to Skovos with some other Horadrim and went on an adventure there. He met this Amazon named Adriana and they formed a bond, so he has some history with her. And now Adriana is the Amazon queen of Skovos. So with him coming back, there's a connection he has to this place that we're going to explore.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: I'm curious about how you guys are going to make players care about Akarat. The importance of the final cut scene of Vessel of Hatred might have been lost on people unless they're in deep on Diablo, but he's obviously a different type of puppet than a wolf. I'm curious about how you think about bringing Akarat as a character into the fold--and all the baggage that comes with him--and trying to explain why that matters while also showing this new version of the Lord of Hatred who is now walking around as a deity.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>When it comes to Akarat, he's just going to appear as a normal man. I think what is going to really cut deep is the amount of people who are now rushing to get to Skovos; seeing the influence that he has because he's such a big figure in the world and he's been doing miracles in Sanctuary. The idea of all these people worshiping this person that you know as a player is Mephisto, I think that is where that terror starts to come.</p><p dir="ltr">He also has his Jedi mind tricks, right? Mephisto is very good at getting in your head. You think you see one thing, but really he's showing you something else and that's the power. We get a chance to show how Mephisto really plays with your emotions and I think that's the best part about him.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Just to add to that, a couple interesting things about Mephisto in this form--and ways to create interest for folks playing through it--is at first he's defying expectations, right? Yeah, he's a prime evil in this body, but he's not doing anything <em>bad</em>, which is interesting because that's how Mephisto was in the base game as well. Oftentimes, he's just telling you the truth. Maybe he's trying to get his own way by saying it, but he isn't always lying about things. Right now, he's just out there helping people and doing miracles. So it becomes this question, or this mystery, of what is he doing it all for? Why is he putting on this act? What's his end game for it all?</p><p dir="ltr">The other thing--and this ties into our themes--is that I think that Mephisto believes that humans don't really have any control over their fate. They're just cattle that more advanced entities or intelligent entities like him can lead around. What he's doing here is almost to prove a point to us, The Wanderer, and also to Lilith; you can create these things, these humans, and you can hope that they have some kind of free will or agency, but ultimately I'm going to show you that they don't. That's something else we play with, again, to just deepen his character a bit and make it more interesting.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: You have described Diablo IV as The Hatred Saga, and with this being the final confrontation with the Lord of Hatred, one would assume that that means that's the end of the aforementioned saga. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about Diablo IV's future. I'm assuming that there's going to be more Diablo IV after this.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> You're right in terms of us just looking at it as The Hatred Saga, and really that's been our focus--just bringing this story to a close in a really big and impactful way. But there are other stories to tell on Sanctuary, of course, though I can't really go into detail about any other stuff.</p><p><strong>Rivera:</strong> I think the best part is Diablo's live service. It gives us the opportunity to dive into whatever we want. Like Season 11, right? We get a chance to bring Hadriel back and we're getting a chance to talk to this angel that we only met briefly in Diablo II. We get to expand Hadriel's lore, which is really cool. We get a chance to always, possibly, tell new stories. But right now, we're just focusing on getting this expansion out and seeing what happens.</p><p><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>

The new area will feature seven new locations, six new characters, and several hours of new content, GSC Game World said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KCLiw3e-b8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4KCLiw3e-b8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">GSC Game World said players will want to pay "close attention" to the Red Forest region on the map, and from there use their intuition and rationality to see how deep this particular irradiated rabbit hole goes. Other points of interest in the Red Forest GSC Game World said will be worth players' time are the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 already sports over 30 weapons, but players will get one more to play with come the update in the form of the GP37V2 rifle, a weapon tailored for "tactically proficient players." The weapon isn't full auto, but can be fired in bursts or in single shots and comes pre-equipped with a suppressor and low-magnification scope.</p><p dir="ltr">"The cost of failure is higher, but in the hands of a skilled operator, the GP37V2 can reward you with its precision and power," GSC Game World said.</p><p dir="ltr">Other additions in the update include a new hub in the Burnt Forest area where players will find NPCs and be able to stash items. Existing locations will now be re-inhabited with other Stalkers as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, GameSpot traveled to GSC Game World's new office in Prague to talk to the Ukrainian development team about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-stalker-2s-developers-persevered-as-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-began/1100-6529870/" data-ref-id="1100-6529870">Stalker 2's harrowing development admist Russia's invasion</a> of their country and how an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-fire-threw-another-wrench-in-stalker-2s-development/1100-6529871/" data-ref-id="1100-6529871">office fire threw another wrench into its plans</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-launch-stalker-2-crosses-major-sales-milestone/1100-6527971/" data-ref-id="1100-6527971">Stalker 2 sold 1 million copies</a> shortly after launch in November 2024 despite also launching as a day-one Game Pass title, and went on to become on of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's 10 best games of 2024</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-series-most-fearful-character-leon-kennedy-series-strongest/</link>
            <guid>1383964</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">At The Game Awards last week</a>, Capcom finally confirmed what we already knew, thanks to a myriad of leaks: that Leon Kennedy would not only be in Resident Evil Requiem but also be<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/"> the second protagonist alongside the previously introduced Grace Ashcroft</a>, and that we would get to play as him.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">all the rumours</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">speculation</a>, and then the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">massive leak ahead of the official reveal</a>, it was good to finally see Leon in Requiem's trailer at The Game Awards, which felt like a sort of vindication for the internet after Capcom tried to deny he was involved.</p>



<p>Now that the secret is officially out, Capcom is already talking about Leon's appearance in Resident Evil Requiem and what he brings to the table alongside Grace Ashcroft. Of course, he's a fan-favourite character, but according to the game's director, Koji Nakinishi, Leon brings more than just his iconic status to Requiem, which is a striking contrast between him and Grace, and how differently players feel when controlling each of them.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60614">Famitsu</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/leon-kennedy-is-the-strongest-person-in-the-history-of-resident-evil-says-requiem-director-1648453/">Gamereactor</a>), Nakinishi called Grace the "<em>most fearful</em>" character in Resident Evil history, while Leon is "<em>the strongest</em>" in Resident Evil, according to Nakinishi. "<em>Grace is the most fearful person in the history of Resident Evil, and Leon is the strongest,</em>" Nakinishi said. "<em>I think one of the highlights will be seeing how these two contrasting characters interact</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We've crafted it to bring out the best in the contrasting characters of Leon and Grace</em>," Nakinishi continued. "<em>It's a gameplay experience unlike anything in the Resident Evil series before, so I hope you'll give it a try</em>."</p>



<p>A good horror game is able to strike a balance between how powerful the player feels and how vulnerable they feel in a given situation. Several games in the Resident Evil series are undoubtedly terrifying, but some of them, including entries featuring Leon, lose control of that balance before you hit credits, and you lose the fear-factor once you know you can bulldoze through any zombie or mangled creature the game puts in front of you.</p>



<p>It seems that with Resident Evil Requiem, Capcom is taking a very direct approach by having you play as both Grace and Leon for different scenarios. It'll be interesting to see how it executes that balance, and if the pendulum swings the other way at unexpected points, like finding yourself powerless while playing as Leon, and vice versa while playing as Grace.</p>



<p>Whatever Resident Evil Requiem has in store for players, we'll be able to find out when it arrives on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026</p>

            <p>
Right, shall we try again? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>! A game that was technically meant to be out by now, but is very obviously not out right now, is now a game that has a release month (no date, Bungie don't appear to be ready to share that one yet). That month is March, 2026, which I'm assuming has been chosen so that PlayStation manage to release one of their many promised but mostly cancelled live service games before the tax year wraps up.
</p>
<p>
This detail was confirmed in a new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">blog post</a> and mini documentary of sorts that Bungie have shared, the blog post also confirming a price point finally (sort of). They're apparently "targeting" $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 as a price point, with more regional pricing to come closer to launch. Obviously inexpensive compared to most big name games these days, but perhaps a barrier too high for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> mired in deeply mixed responses.

<p>
Anyway, I won't run through everything, but let me detail some of the new bits shown off in the documentary. Complaints about being forced to play with others have been heard, as the game will feature a solo queue. Proximity chat has also been confirmed, a feature I'm sure will afford many a slur to be said simply for playing with a toy.
</p><p>
A brief insight into factions were shown off, where you might be tasked with looting a bunch of guns, or blowing up a ton of stuff. These factions all have upgrade trees that grant you various boons, a point I am already yawning at. There's this thing called The Codex that stores all the bits of lore, including things like audio logs and the like. Which, as a point, surely bits like that will be such a run killer? I wonder how that'll work into terms of the actual gameplay. It'll all just fall flat if you're just sitting on a menu listening to the story the game isn't actually telling.
</p>
<p>
The most crushing element of all of this is just how beautiful Marathon continues to look. Inside it is a world I'm desperate to explore, and yet I know in my heart that the game's PvP elements, we all can sense will be a hotbed of toxicity, will put me off the thing entirely. Admittedly I am not the core audience, I don't play many shooters anyway, but hotdog do I like some bold sci-fi.
</p>
<p>
What I can't stop thinking about since watching the mini doc is the very last line from one of the game's devs: "It's a mad dash to finish, but that's when you got to put in the elbow grease and the extra sweat and blood that it takes to get this done." Blood has been spilled, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">figuratively</a>, to get this thing made, and all I can hope is that for some of those that remain, getting it out is worth it.

The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWCUmTTVjMY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CWCUmTTVjMY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, until the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/segachannel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Game History Foundation</a> embarked on a quest to see the channel's unique history, and its content, preserved. Alongside former Sega Channel VP of programming Michael Shorrock and a passionate Sega fan who had acquired a collection of Sega Channel backup tapes, VGHF sought to tell the full story of the Sega Channel.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is 144 new ROMs that have been preserved, a new VGHF digital library collection that includes Shorrock's personal notes and presentations shedding light on the service (and an unannounced successor service called Express Games), and a documentary, Don't Just Watch TV: The Secrets of Sega Channel, which can be viewed on YouTube.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of its efforts, VGHF acquired a collection of ROMs that included some rare prototypes and games, including a never-before-seen Sega Genesis web browser and previously undumped game variants of Sega Channel-exclusive games, like Garfield: Caught in the Act - The Lost Levels and The Flintstones. According to VGHF, both games originated as abandoned projects that were then repurposed into exclusive Sega Channel content.</p><p dir="ltr">Also included in the files are previously unpreserved Sega Channel versions of games like Super Street Fighter II, which saw content removed in order to fit within Sega Channel's file-size limit. Other games on the service that were linear in nature were essentially split down the middle to fit within the file-size limit, with users needing a password to access the second half of the game. These split versions, as well as various "test drive" versions of games like Earthworm Jim and The Lost World: Jurassic Park that allowed Sega Channel players to play before their official release, have also been preserved.</p><p dir="ltr">"With a few exceptions, this recovery project has accounted for almost all outstanding Sega Channel games," the VGHF states in its findings. "We believe this also means there are now digital backup copies of every unique Sega Genesis game released in the United States."</p><p dir="ltr">The project to preserve Sega Channel is just one of VGHF's success stories this year, with the foundation previously announcing the launch of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-history-foundation-massive-digital-library-is-now-open-to-the-public/1100-6529151/" data-ref-id="1100-6529151">free-to-access digital resource library</a> for historians, researchers, and fans that includes more than 30,000 files from across 50 years of video game history. In August, the VGHF announced it had acquired the rights to publish a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vghf-adds-complete-digital-archive-of-classic-video-game-magazine/1100-6533722/" data-ref-id="1100-6533722">digital archive for the entirity of Computer Entertainer</a>, one of the first video game magazines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For months after <a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions/"><em><u>Tiny Bookshop</u></em></a> was released on Nintendo Switch in August, the indie game remained on the platform's bestseller list, hovering around the likes of <em>Hades 2</em> and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. But in late November, <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> dropped off the list—and off the Nintendo Switch eShop entirely—due to a discrepancy between its digital age and content rating and the rating tied to its upcoming physical version. <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> originally had an "E" rating—for everyone—but was upgraded to a "T for teens" rating.</p><p>The reason for the ratings upgrade? One word: "Arsehole," said Neoludic Games.</p><p><em>Tiny Bookshop</em> remained off the Nintendo Switch store in all regions for nearly two weeks, cutting into sales on what Neoludic Games says is its most prolific platform. "The impact was immediate and severe," Neoludic co-CEO and creative director David Zapfe-Wildemann told Aftermath.</p><p>"We noticed [the game wasn’t on the store] when people started reaching out via DM asking what was going on," he said. "Because there is a small delay between the Switch backend and the public web version, we didn't understand what was happening at first."</p><p>Neoludic Games wasn't notified that <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> was removed from the eShop until <em>after</em> it was taken down. "The process was completely opaque," Skystone Games (which published <em>Tiny Bookshop)</em> publishing head Dmitry Muratov said.</p><p><em>Tiny Bookshop</em> is a management simulator set in a mobile bookshop by a beach. Acting as the bookseller, players design the little shop and then sell books to customers; the puzzles are in finding the right real-world and fictional books to recommend. Neoludic Games describes <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> as "cozy," and it certainly is. The quaint bookshop is the epitome of the word, and the low-stakes gameplay makes the game very chilled out.</p><p>Muratov called the ratings process that caused the eShop removal a "black box" that the studio and publisher got caught up in. Most games have a rating, but games that are sold physically have a more "official" rating than those that are only sold digitally. The digital ratings system is handled through an automated system with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), which works with the different ratings agencies, like the ESRB. Developers fill out a survey through the IARC system to self-evaluate their game, which spits out an automated rating based on the answers. Developers then provide a certification of that rating to storefronts to be able to sell digitally.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Neoludic Games/Skystone Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>Zapfe-Wildemann said the digital certification through the IARC required very little detail and had "a lack of clear guidelines." Other developers who spoke to Aftermath about the IARC said the system can feel subjective—something that's especially relevant following the ratings debacle regarding Santa Ragione's <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/"><em><u>Horses</u></em></a>. <em>Horses</em> has been in the spotlight over the past several weeks after it was <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>removed from the Epic Games Store</u></a> for its rating; using the IARC process, Santa Ragione received a Mature rating. Epic Games filed its own IARC questionnaire and found the game to be ranked as Adults Only, therefore not publishable on its storefront. (Several developers and industry experts told Aftermath that they'd never heard of a platform filing for its own IARC rating.)&nbsp;</p><p>The IARC rating allows for games to display, for instance, an ESRB on a digital storefront. Crucially, it's a free-to-use tool that allows developers to get their games rated without much friction—and keeps rating bodies from being overwhelmed by having to have humans go through the hundreds of games released each month. IARC spits out a rating that's adaptable for the different regions a game is released in. One video game industry expert told Aftermath that rating bodies, like ESRB and PEGI, do run checks on IARC ratings to ensure accuracy, be it popular games or ones that get complaints.</p><p>Physical editions require a more detailed rating to be sold in stores, however, which made the ESRB and other countries' ratings processes necessary for <em>Tiny Bookshop</em>. That process is more robust and requires developers to submit footage, builds, and marketing materials, the expert said. The result is a formal rating from a thorough assessment of a game by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>"We started working together with a UK-based publisher for a physical release of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em>," Zapfe-Wildemann said. "That process mandated getting a detailed review by each target region's rating agency. In that re-review, the ESRB flagged the word 'Arsehole' in one of the 300+ book descriptions as severe enough to warrant a 'T' rating."</p><p>Neoludic Games only learned of the upgraded rating <em>after</em> Nintendo delisted the game and the process was completed. "It would have been five minutes of work to replace the word had we been informed, or had we had a way to track which swear word is considered severe in the IARC system," Zapfe-Wildemann said.</p><p>"A single word in more than 100,000 words of localization was caught and scrutinized without a chance for us to fix it pre-release," Muratov said. "It’s frustrating when you see massive AAA games with much more mature themes, while a cozy bookshop game gets pulled over a single instance of text."</p><p>The upgraded T rating triggered a "mandatory update to the digital store," Zapfe-Wildemann said, which resulted in the "immediate delisting" of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em>. On Oct. 17, which is the last date the best-sellers page was recorded by the Wayback Machine, <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> was in the ninth row of the U.S. bestsellers. (In September, it was listed 12th on the page, and in August, it was the second game. In the first month alone, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2133760/view/542241191160185439?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Neoludic Games sold more than 300,000 copies of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em></u></a>. By December, that number surpassed 500,000.) Being removed from the Nintendo Switch eShop dropped <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> from the list, Neoludic Games said. Now, after being re-added in early December, it's much further down the page in the U.S. region. Neoludic Games estimated that it lost 10,000 sales due to the removal from the eShop and its subsequent absence from the bestsellers list.</p><p>"On Switch, the bestseller list is one of the most critical discoverability tools the platform has," Zapfe-Wildemann said. "Our release momentum was still carrying us in the charts of some regions when the incident happened. It is incredibly difficult to re-enter those charts once that momentum is broken."</p><p>Muratov said that getting back into the bestsellers list is "very hard or impossible," but that the studio managed to get back into the top 30 recently. "That couldn't have happened without an amazing worldwide community rallying behind us," he said.</p>
