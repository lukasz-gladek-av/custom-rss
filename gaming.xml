            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now that <em>Balatro</em> is out on mobile, I wanted to see what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">all the fuss</a> was about. And while it’s a great game, its tutorial doesn’t do the best job of setting you up for the kind of success necessary to hook you. In my first few hours, though I was completing the objectives laid out, it felt like I was stumbling my way to success instead of achieving it through strategy. Onboarding was a bit too abrupt, focused on the barebones of how to play instead of blending that with tips on how to play <em>effectively. </em>With that in mind, here’s some useful info and tips on how to get started.</p><p><h4><strong>I was told there would be no math</strong></h4></p><p>In <em>Balatro</em>, the main gameplay loop is amassing enough poker chips to beat a set chip total called a blind. To do that, you must create the ideal poker hand that maximizes the number of chips you can earn. I think what I initially had so much trouble with was understanding how scoring worked. Numbers were flying at me, and I didn’t know what they meant or where they came from. Knowing how scoring works is <em>critical </em>to maximizing your chip-earning potential.</p><p>Each hand you play is assigned a simple math equation: </p><p><em>Total chips earned = chip value of cards x multiplier score</em>.</p><div><figcaption><em>These are the math equations assigned to every hand. Using special cards, you can modify these base equations to increase your score.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>The math equation is different for every type of poker hand, and the more powerful a hand is, the bigger the equation. You don’t have to remember hand hierarchies or their equation values — simply hitting the “Run Info” button will pull up a reference list. Now, here’s the important part: this math equation changes based on the cards you play and any modifiers you’ve earned. For example, the base equation for two pair is 20 chips x 2 multiplier score. If I play two queens and two 3s, I can figure out my score by adding the total chip value of my cards (10+10+3+3=26) to the equation’s chip value (20) and then multiplying that number by 2, equalling 92 chips.</p><div><figcaption><em>Scoring works by adding up all the chip values and all the multiplier values and then multiplying the two numbers together.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>I’m loath to admit how long it took me to understand what was going on, but once I figured it out, everything clicked. I finally <em>got</em> what it was that makes this game hard to put down. Some of these blinds require amassing thousands of chips, so the main point — and honestly the biggest fun factor — of <em>Balatro</em> is beefing up those equations and your cards as much as possible. Which brings me to the next tip.</p><p><h4><strong>Cash rules everything around me</strong></h4></p><p>I wish the game took more time to explain that, early on, money is <em>everything</em>. For each blind, you have a number of chances or hands to earn enough chips, and if you don’t like the cards in your hand, you have a number of opportunities to discard cards in hopes of getting better ones. You earn the most money by beating blinds in the least amount of hands and with the fewest discards as possible. There are other ways to earn money, too, with special cards and perks you can get. Once you unlock it, use the special deck that starts you off with an extra $10 instead of the regular $4. Look for the perk (called a “tag”) that gives you $25 for beating “boss blinds” — or harder blinds that introduce some kind of negative effect like lowering equation values while requiring you to earn abnormally high amounts of chips. Bank as much as you can, as early as you can in order to...</p><p><h4><strong>Shop till you drop</strong></h4></p><p>The amazing thing about <em>Balatro</em> is that it’s managed to effectively reproduce the thrill of opening loot boxes without needing to spend a single dime on microtransactions. At the end of every blind, you get to visit the shop where you buy cards that add to or modify your deck, vouchers that impart powerful perks like the ability to increase your hand size, or jokers that have all kinds of score-modifying abilities. Go for the jokers that increase bonuses every round based on meeting certain criteria so your scoring potential can grow exponentially. My most successful run featured a joker that added a +1 to my multiplier every time I didn’t play a face card. By the end of that run, I was scoring upwards of 10,000 chips from the weakest hands played with the cheapest cards. If you see jokers that don’t work with your strategy, don’t forget that you can spend money to reroll the shop for new ones.</p><div><figcaption><em>In the shop, you can buy cards that modify other cards or increase the value of specific hands.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>Unlike most other roguelikes that let you keep some abilities or items when you die, when you fail a run at <em>Balatro</em>, all your special cards, vouchers, perks, and cash go away. You can’t take cash with you, so spend it.</p><p>Lastly, if you want to make sure you have a good time with <em>Balatro</em>...</p><div><figcaption><em>Even </em>Balatro<em>’s developer knows this game is a problem.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p><h4><strong>Install an app blocker (seriously)</strong></h4></p><p>Runs in <em>Balatro</em> are short and seamless, making it trivial to get into a groove even after having to start over after a failed attempt. And if you’re an adult with responsibilities, that’s going to be a problem — especially on mobile. Three hours in real time feels like only 20 minutes, making <em>Balatro</em> the closest human beings have gotten to legitimate time travel. After wrapping up my first day with the game sometime around 5AM without feeling the slightest bit tired, I added it to my app blocker, setting it to cut off access every day at midnight. Those <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255304/bye-forever-because-balatro-is-out-now-on-mobile">jokes about <em>Balatro</em></a> <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/141549/balatro-mobile-impressions">being a productivity problem</a> aren’t that far off the mark, so if you want to try to get some sleep or work done, put guardrails in place so you can.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/let-the-last-of-us-tv-show-be-different-from-the-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>Warning: This piece contains full spoilers for The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series"><u>The Last of Us</u></a> is part of an ongoing craze of faithful video game adaptations with roots traceable <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-silent-hill-paved-the-way-for-the-video-game-adaptation-craze"><u>all the way back</u></a> to the original Silent Hill film. However, adapting a game like The Last of Us Part II is a bit different from adapting its predecessor, not just because it has a more complicated, fractured narrative, but also because it’s a (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review"><u>phenomenal</u></a>) game with much more dramatic meat to explore, both in terms of sheer length and in the thornier dimensions it mines from its characters. To make a show that stands up to its inspiration, it most likely will have to make some major deviations from the source material. While diehard fans may cry foul, it might be the only way this adaptation can feel as vital as the game does.</p><p>It’s something co-showrunner Neil Druckmann, who is also creative director of The Last of Us games, agrees on. Talking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/last-of-us-season-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-strictly-business-1236155347/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> about the adaptation process, he noted that a common mistake is “staying so close to the source material that is built and designed and written for this other medium that has strengths and weaknesses, and trying to translate it as is, with no changes to this other medium that has different strengths and weaknesses.” Looking at the newly released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-debut-trailer-shows-joel-and-ellie-5-years-after-the-events-of-season-1"><u>first trailer</u></a> for Season 2, we can already see the first signs of how Druckmann and his creative partner Craig Mazin may have altered the original story to suit the television medium.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Max (@StreamOnMax) <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1839319097273889280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2><strong>Different Mediums, Different Priorities</strong></h2><p>With so many artistic mediums bleeding into each other these days, it can sometimes be hard to remember that video games and television are two very different things. Every medium for telling stories has pros and cons that are virtually inseparable from the form. The narrative techniques that make perfect sense in interactive fiction in regards to scene geography, atmosphere, environmental design, and use of player expression often don’t translate to something with a set runtime and no input from the viewer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The narrative techniques that make perfect sense in interactive fiction often don’t translate to something with a set runtime and no input from the viewer.</p></div><p>That’s not to say you can’t try. The first season of The Last of Us meticulously rebuilt many moments from the game’s cutscenes, sometimes literally frame by frame. But what purpose does that really serve? The story worked excellently the first time around, the game is available in its best ever form with The Last of Us Part I Remastered, and the cutscenes are readily available on YouTube. If people want a truly faithful version of the story, it’s already out there and has been for years. If anything, taking this cutscene cloning approach, rather than allowing the show’s direction and cinematography to present the story’s most critical moments in a wholly new way, only highlights the ways the original games frequently veered away from the strengths of interactive narrative. And it’s developer Naughty Dog’s adoption of non-interactive storytelling technique that makes such scenes so easy to plop directly into a TV show.</p><p>I say this as a massive fan of both games: they kind of already were HBO shows. They do use the possibilities of interactive storytelling to their advantage, but in terms of basic construction and scene direction, even during playable segments, there’s liberal use of the techniques and stylistic conventions of prestige television. This is why it isn’t just ironic that the games were eventually adapted as an HBO show; it was so easy <em>to </em>adapt them because the games did a lot of the work already. This is not to discount any of the contributions from the show’s directors, writers or performers, but the blueprint for a successful television show was already baked straight into the game. So if the next season wants to be its best self, it would do well to find a new way to present the story many of us already know.</p><h2><strong>Expand and Explore</strong></h2><p>Even with its fealty to the original game, the first season of The Last of Us often benefited from the deviations it did make. Hiring Latino actor Pedro Pascal gave a strong new take for main protagonist Joel by adding a softer dad-like quality to him compared to Troy Baker’s gruffer edge, adding new characters like Melanie Lynskey’s Kathleen expanded the post-apocalyptic world explored in the original game, and devoting an entire episode to the unseen story of Bill (Nick Offerman) and his lover Frank (Murray Bartlett) led to what many considered to be the season’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-3-review"><u>best entry.</u></a> Unlike a video game, which usually necessitates some kind of consistency to the player perspective through the controllable character, television affords the opportunity to shift focus more readily, and the show made great use of that in key areas.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Last of Us Season 2 Cast: Who's New and Coming Back to the HBO Show?</h3></div></output><p>The second season should use that technique to greater effect. One of the main structural conceits of Part II is playing through the same three days from both Ellie and Abby’s perspectives. Their separate paths don’t really cross over until the end of the three days, both of them going through intensely personal journeys of revenge and rebirth respectively, meaning that each lead character is essentially gone from the narrative for somewhere around ten solid hours apiece. This makes sense in a video game because jumping back and forth between protagonists each level would be jarring for a player, never allowing them to truly settle into the peaks and valleys of power and equipment a survival action game is supposed to foster. But do we really want to watch four or five episodes in a row without Ellie or Abby showing up?</p><p>Intercutting between their journeys and finding ways to draw thematic parallels between Ellie and Abby even when they’re not in the same physical space would help maintain emotional continuity and viewer investment in both characters. After all, the entire point of the extended lead-up to their confrontation is that it’s a battle we don’t want either side to “win,” because we’ve come to empathize with their experiences. It’s hard for an audience at home to go through that if a character is absent for several weeks of television. We also know that Season 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunner-says-hbo-series-should-be-around-for-a-while-beyond-season-2"><u>won’t adapt the entirety</u></a> of Part II, which gives the creators plenty of breathing room to add or expand on characters, subplots and world-building concepts that could give the series a fresh feel. If the trailer is anything to go by, we may have already seen hints of the show going in this direction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Trust the Process</strong></h2><p>It’s a small detail, but the teaser trailer hints at what could be a major deviation from the original game’s setup: it looks like Abby will spend time in Jackson with Joel and Ellie. After we see Abby’s first encounter with Joel and Tommy where they save her from infected trying to get at her through a chain link fence (a scene ripped straight from the game), we later see a shot of the three of them fleeing on horses before what appears to be a horde of infected slamming themselves against Jackson’s perimeter wall. There’s also an earlier shot of a large group of infected being spotted through binoculars as they run through snow, indicating that they are heading towards Jackson, the only area in the game where snow is featured. This all suggests that there could be a sequence where Abby and Joel get back to Jackson and have more interaction than they do in the game (perhaps even involving Ellie) before Abby kills Joel. Such a sequence would be a prime opportunity for more character drama, as well as also giving us more scenes with Pascal before he’s relegated to flashbacks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The teaser trailer hints at what could be a major deviation from the original game’s setup.</p></div><p>Abby ingratiating herself within Jackson’s community (a story thread concept art for the second game confirms the developers considered) and perhaps even casting her as an ally who helps them overcome an infected attack would provide us more context and inner conflict, giving the scene where she finally reveals her true motives a greater sense of dramatic weight. We get little time with Abby before she kills Joel in the game, which is a shocking scene in its original form, but viewers at home might feel a little lost if someone they assume to be one of the series’ two leads is killed so abruptly in the first couple of episodes. Getting us into Abby’s headspace earlier so we know exactly what she’s planning and why is the sort of shift that would help smooth that plot development over. And let’s be real here, more Kaitlyn Dever is never a bad thing (Did you see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollywood-please-release-your-horror-movies-in-theaters-not-on-streaming"><u>No One Will Save You</u></a>? She was very good in that).</p><p>Ultimately, we don’t know exactly how The Last of Us Season 2 will pan out, but based on the first season, it’s fair to say the creative team behind the show can be extended a little bit of trust. There’s a murderer’s row of talent involved in the production, and although a game series as beloved as this can engender strong protective feelings from its fans, it can be rewarding to let an adaptation of a story you already know surprise you. The game isn’t going anywhere. The story will always exist in that form. So let’s have a little faith and see what the differences in the new season will add to the story, instead of assuming they’ll only subtract.</p><p><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

			<p>The high price ($699) of the PS5 Pro remains a hotly debated subject in the industry. While many fans are still disappointed with the pricing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts </a>and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-price-is-not-that-bad-says-zampella-youre-not-getting-the-same-performance-from-a-700-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game developers</a> have publicly said it makes sense, considering the market and what's in the hardware.</p>
<p>As for Sony itself, the company recently commented on the topic of pricing (and the decision to leave the disc drive as a separate purchase) in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-ps5-pro-toshi-aoki-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>. PlayStation Senior Principal Product Manager Toshi Aoki said:</p>
<p><em>Well, the technologies that I just mentioned that we are putting in to deliver new experiences for game players, and also not just the technological differences, but the SSD, the Wi-Fi 7, and the new technologies that surround the gameplay as well. So it's more of a full package that will give that exceptional value to the players... the most engaged players that we're targeting.</em></p>
<p><em>With the PS5 Pro, we are offering all these new tech innovations, and we added the two terabyte SSD, as well as the Wi-Fi 7. We believe as a full package that it offers for the most players. For the disc drive, it is an option for players. Not all players have discs, even though most players may...but we have the option for being able to add that for those players. So I think it's more of the balance of the value proposition that we're giving.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Aoki also confirmed that Sony had been working on the PS5 Pro even before the base console launched in November 2020.</p>
<p><em>We started discussing it before the PS5 actually came out...because the PS5 specs were already locked in. We were ready to launch and everything. We knew, of course, as you mentioned, technologies evolve every year.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will be released on November 7 for $699 / £699 / €799, featuring 67% more Compute Units than the base PS5 as well as the machine learning DLSS-like antialiasing reconstruction technique called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR). Moreover, its ray tracing capabilities are vastly superior, thanks to improved ray tracing technology borrowed from unreleased AMD graphics cards <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following Sony's push</a>.</p>

			<p>Developer Shift Up has <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1839678161963114954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> update 01.007.000 for Stellar Blade. This patch improves certain visual elements, mainly body collision for the protagonist, and adds a few quality-of-life features listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can still enjoy the "Summer Event" at the Oasis by turning on/off the summer event content toggle.</li>
<li>The summer event BGM (Don't Forget Me) is now available at the camp.</li>
<li>You can mark pins on the map by pressing □ button on the map.</li>
<li>You can use favorites feature on EVE's equipment.</li>
<li>New item "Ammo Package" is now available for purchase, which allows you to stock up on all ammunitions to max at once.</li>
<li>Purchase confirmation pop-up will be shown when spending over 15,000 golds to prevent any unintentional spend.</li>
<li>Visual improvements of conflicts between EVE's body.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shift Up and Sony were recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted by a lawsuit</a> in the United States. The owner of StellarBlade.com, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, has shared the following statement via his lawyer:</p>
<p><em>Mr. Mehaffey registered the&nbsp;<span>stellarblade.com</span>&nbsp;domain in 2006 and has used the STELLARBLADE name for his business for nearly 15 years. Given this long-standing and public use, it's difficult to imagine that Shift Up and Sony were unaware of Mr. Mehaffey's established rights before adopting their identical mark. We believe in fair competition, but when larger companies disregard the established rights of smaller businesses, it's our responsibility to stand up and protect our brand. The defendants’ far superior resources have effectively monopolized online search results for STELLARBLADE, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade.</em></p>
<p>So far, neither Shift Up nor Sony have commented on the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the Seoul-based studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing DLCs and a PC port</a> for Stellar Blade following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly successful IPO</a> (initial public offering).</p>

		<p>It’s Zelda O’Clock in Nintendoland, with the release this week of Echoes of Wisdom and the first actual Zelda-centric game in the series. It’s a lovely time, if you ask me, though sure to be a slightly acquired taste for the shift in gameplay style.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-first-look-fire-breathing-little-freaks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many a&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;fan, half the fun of the game is waiting to see what new armies will be brought out onto the pitch in a new issue of <em>Spike Journal</em>. And this time around, <em>Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;is truly playing to the crowd with the inclusion of Chaos Dwarfs into the game! Games Workshop provided us with a copy of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;to check out ahead of its release, so read on for our quick-look preview!</p>
<h2>Chaos Dwarfs Shine Like Hot Rocks</h2>
<p>Let's jump right in and talk about the Chaos Dwarfs, and the role they'll be playing in&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>. Fresh from the forges of Zharr-Naggrund, the Chaos Dwarfs erupt onto the field ready for some serious carnage. In fact, they're so good at duking it out with their opponents that they often forget to move the ball around. Luckily, a Chaos Dwarfs team can also field Hobgoblins, who do a lot of the ball carrying.</p>
<p>A Chaos Dwarfs team can employ the following units:</p>
<ul><li>0 - 16 Hobgoblin Lineman</li>
<li>0-2 Hobgoblin Sneaky Stabba</li>
<li>0-4 Chaos Dwarf Blocker</li>
<li>0-2 Chaos Dwarf Flamesmith</li>
<li>0-2 Bull Centaur Blitzer</li>
<li>0-1 Minotaur</li>
</ul><p>They also feature a brand new trait, "Breathe Fire (trait)," which states that Once per activation, instead of performing a Block action (either on its own or as part of a Blitz action), this player may perform a Breathe Fire Special action. When you do so, you choose one Standing opposition player and roll a D6, with a good enough roll, you can light them on fire and knock them down!</p>

In addition, the Claws skill cannot be used when making an Armour roll against this player."</p>
<p>I really love the flavor seen throughout the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>, as we get a ton of lore and history around Chaos Dwarfs in the world of <em>Blood Bowl</em>. As always, the&nbsp;<em>Journal&nbsp;</em>is full of that classic wit and good sense of humor that adds some levity to this wonderfully ridiculous game.</p>
<h2>Star Players Make The Grade</h2>
<p>Contained within the pages of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;are three Star Players from the world of the Chaos Dwarfs! They each bring something unique to the game. Let's start with Zzharg Madeye, a Thrower who's a master of tinkering with the blunderbuss. His special ability, "Then I Started Blastin'!", gives him the opportunity to try and take a shot at an opposing player.</p>
<p>There's also H'thark the Unstoppable, a Bull Centaur Blitzer with the "Unstoppable Momentum" special ability that allows him to re-roll a single block die when he blitzes. I really like the look of this player, and love how the Chaos Dwarfs let you get some Bull Centaurs onto the field.</p>

Rashnak is a Sneaky Stabba who's special ability allows him to add to his injury roll if he successfully breaks armor with a Stab action, because he's bringing poison onto the field. Each of these three Star Players of course also feature great stats, and a range of impressive Skills and Traits. All in all I think Zzharg Madeye is likely the most exciting of the group, but each plays a great role on the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pro Playbook Helps You Score</h2>
<p>Also of note is the very helpful Pro Playbook toward the back of the book, which helps you get to know the Chaos Dwarf crew and is useful in thinking about how to field your team. This is especially appreciated as, and even the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>&nbsp;itself admits this, Chaos Dwarf teams can be tricky to field at first because of all the different moving parts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-.jpg?itok=C3sPsUKl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-.jpg?itok=QDowLRSL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Because some of the players on a Chaos Dwarf team will invariably be slow (aka Dwarfs) while others are quite fast (like Centaurs and Hobgoblins), keeping your group more or less together will be key to success. With advice for how to field on offense (crunch the defense and then have your speedier players gain forward momentum) and defense (let none pass your little shield wall of stocky dudes), the Pro Playbook is extremely helpful.</p>
<p><em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal</em>&nbsp;<em>18</em>&nbsp;also features rules for&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Bowl</em>, tons of lore, and a classic comic strip. If you're interested in building up a Chaos Dwarf team, <i>Spike Journal 18</i>&nbsp;is a must!</p>

		<p>A new trailer for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake">Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</a> has debuted ahead of the game’s upcoming release with preorders now live. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> will bring the reinvigorated grand strategy game to PS4, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch late next month on October 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 8 REMAKE - Second Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6L-YjfVkQPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The latest trailer gives fans an overview of the many systems and features at play. For those completely new to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it’s an ongoing series of historical grand strategy titles that originated in 1985, allowing players to command armies during ancient China’s Warring States period. It’s the same setting used in Koei’s flagship <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise which is being rebooted early next year with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay/">the launch of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025</a>.</p>
<p>ROTK fans each have their own favourite in the series, though 8 remains one of the most pivotal and popular instalments. Koei and developer Kou Shibusawa seem to think so, with Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake receiving more than just a simple remaster treatment. New content and features have been added to the game, deepening the web of strategic and roleplaying options, as well as the number of playable scenarios.</p>
<p>The newly added Wisdom trait will offer an additional layer of player progression that not only increases as you participate in battles, but also when you interact with fellow officers. The popular Duels features has also seen a significant upgrade, now complemented by Debates which allow shrewd strategists to take part in non-combat political showdowns.</p>

<h3>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every officer can be the hero! The “All Officers Play” of ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS VIII returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>More than 55 scenarios spanning over 80 years and featuring the largest number of officers in the series, from rulers to free officers. Play through a vast, deep, and turbulent Three Kingdoms period as you choose.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vivid depiction of the drama between officers. A variety of fascinating new features!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many new features have been added to portray a variety of human dramas, such as “Tales” in which players can choose which events unfold. In addition, you can be linked by “Destiny” with other officers, and gain special relationships.</p>
<p>The relationship or “Links Forged” between each officer greatly affects how the gameplay unfolds. Changes in that relationship can be ascertained from the “Relationship Chart”.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphical enhancements</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to newly drawn officer graphics, the scenic beauty of the game is depicted using ink paintings, combining 2D visuals and 3D depth to create a beautiful visual experience of the world of the Three Kingdoms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-trading-card-games-worth-getting-into.995076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tcgs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Today, card games are everywhere, but in 1993, the trading card game (TCG) genre was born with just one: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game">Magic: The Gathering</a>, created by Richard Garfield. I became a fan a few years later, in 1996, during the release of the Fourth Edition core set.</p><p>Once I got the hang of the game, I was hooked for nearly three years. The artwork drew me in, and the flavor text – often witty, dark, and sarcastic – kept me entertained, but what I loved most was playing. The tactile thrill of placing a card on the table, imagining myself as a powerful planeswalker commanding forces beyond mortal comprehension, was unbeatable.</p><p>Though other trading card games existed back then, my loyalty to Magic: The Gathering consumed both my attention and my budget. Fast forward to today, and the landscape is even more crowded. The old titans of the genre are still thriving, while countless newer games vie for attention, each bringing something unique to the table. </p><p>With that in mind, here are the 10 best trading and living card games to dive into in 2024 – games that are fun to play, boast active communities, and have the potential for long-term growth. Whatever you decide to try out and play, make sure you have a community to share it with: either a local one where you live or an online one that is supportive. The community surrounding the game is as important as the game itself.</p><h2><strong>The Big Three</strong></h2><p>These are the established choices for anyone who's deciding on a trading card game.</p><h3><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong></h3><div catalogid="c3ff5053-f2c1-4f32-ad5c-f8565776ad6e" id="205115"><div id="205115" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Magic: The Gathering 2021 Arena Starter Kit</h3></p><div><p>Start small with this affordable starter kit.</p></div></div><p>The original trading card playing experience, Magic: The Gathering established so many norms that we take for granted today. Plains, Swamps, Forests, Mountains, Islands – these were the lands you drew power from, to call angels, demons, zombies, orcs, goblins, and enchanted creatures to your side. The benefits of picking up Magic: The Gathering now, nearly 30 years into its run, are the same as the drawbacks: It's just so big at this point. There's a lot to explore and play with, but it can be intimidating and overwhelming to learn it from scratch. As was true back when I started playing, the best way to learn is not by reading the instruction booklet that comes with every starter deck, but by having a friend walk you through a match.</p><p><em>You can check out our guide to all of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2024"><em>upcoming MTG releases</em></a><em> coming in 2024 and beyond.</em></p><h3><strong>Pokémon TCG</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8a5b9f41-9977-449d-9c9e-ac7ca8f498bf" id="201934"><div id="201934" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet— Temporal Forces Elite Trainer Box</h3></p><div><p>The Elite Trainer Box includes cool card sleeves featuring Walking Wake or Iron Leaves, high-quality accessories, 9 booster packs, and much more.</p></div></div><p>Still popular after all these years, Pokemon TCG started in 1996. Its cards in America were originally published by Wizards of the Coast, the same company that published Magic: The Gathering. Pokemon's fan base has always been more collector-heavy than player-heavy, but this has been especially true in recent years, as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-check-value-of-pokemon-cards">value of Pokemon cards</a> has continued to go up. (Most famously in 2021, Logan Paul <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-expensive-pokemon-cards">paid $5.27 million</a> for a Grade 10 Pokemon Illustrator card, which he occasionally wears around his neck when he wrestles in WWE.) Beyond this, there's an appealing simplicity to Pokemon, in that your turn is largely your own; you aren't overlapping moves or playing over your opponent's turn, which makes things a lot more streamlined.</p><p><em>You can check out our guide to all of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2024"><em>upcoming Pokemon TCG releases</em></a><em> coming in 2024 and beyond.</em></p><h3><strong>Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="14a77cec-3191-46e6-b5e7-9e18c747b1f5" id="207823"><div id="207823" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG: 25th Anniversary Tin</h3></p><div><p>Pick up a starter set of Yu-Gi-Oh cards at an affordable price.</p></div></div><p>Recognized in 2009 by Guinness as the highest-selling trading card game in the world, Yu-Gi-Oh! popularized chains as a gameplay mechanic, and it was considerably more chaotic than its predecessors. You're often countering and making significant moves during your opponent's turn in addition to your own, and on its highest levels, the victor can be determined on a starting hand and who goes first. Your enjoyment will largely depend on who you learn from, especially if you're coming into the game cold.</p><h2><strong>The Newcomers</strong></h2><p>The seven TCGs below might not have the decades-long legacies of the Big Three, but they're making plenty of noise and are worth checking out.</p><h3><strong>Digimon TCG</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="b8f18be2-486d-4463-9908-3a3f68f29806" id="207827"><div id="207827" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Digimon Card Game Starter Deck: Dragon of Courage</h3></p><div><p>Comes with a total of 54 cards.</p></div></div><p>Newly revamped for 2020, Digimon's main draw is its progression: Hatch an egg, have it undergo Digivolution (which allows you to improve upon your Digimon's stats), and move it to the Battle Area to attack your opponent. It is still a newer TCG game, relatively speaking, which means that it doesn't have the legacy baggage of the prior three. The community is notably welcoming and open to new innovations, and the metagame is diverse and still in the process of being defined.</p><h3><strong>Netrunner</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="34758424-cc74-4a65-a7ef-1def5b44aef7" id="207829"><div id="207829" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Android Netrunner LCG: True Colors Data Pack</h3></p></div><p>Set in a cyberpunk dystopia, <a href="https://nullsignal.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netrunner</a>, which pits hackers against a faceless corporate entity, has a long, complex history. The original physical card game came out in 1996, and it was revamped and released as Android: Netrunner in 2012. Today, it currently exists as an ongoing fan project. Non-profit game publisher Null Signal Games releases new starter and expansion sets, and the PDFs are all available on a pay-what-you-want basis. These new sets are also compatible with the prior Android: Netrunner sets, and everything, from the artwork to the new mechanics, feels legitimate and true to form.</p><h3><strong>Disney Lorcana</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="80627262-4d23-4f43-b7ab-b5b35d71d061" id="207002"><div id="207002" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Disney Lorcana: The First Chapter TCG Captain Hook Deck Box</h3></p></div><p>When Disney commits to something, they go full throttle. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-lorcana">Disney Lorcana</a>, which draws from over 100 years of Disney animated history, takes full advantage of the nostalgia and sea of creative properties inherent in its brand. Instead of land, you summon with ink, and true to Disney's family-friendly image, you accumulate 20 points instead of decimating your opponent's life to win. There are currently over 600 different cards in print between the starter set and the two expansions. The newest expansion, Chapter 4: Ursula's Return, launched on May 31.</p><h3><strong>Marvel Champions: The Card Game</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="432139cf-826e-468c-922a-f9287d84bfd2" id="157793"><div id="157793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Marvel Champions: The Card Game</h3></p><div><p>The base set includes 343 cards.</p></div></div><p>Name recognition goes a long way. In Marvel Champions, select the specific Marvel superhero that you want to play. Then, team up with other players and work through different scenarios, in which you defeat villains and foil their schemes. The Core set starts you with five different selectable heroes: Iron Man, Black Panther, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and She-Hulk. Subsequent Expansion packs give you prebuilt decks that allow you to play as over 30 additional characters and face additional villains with different storylines. It's among one of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">favorite Marvel card games</a> available.</p><h3><strong>Arkham Horror: The Card Game </strong></h3></div><div catalogid="d2a8ea61-6747-4491-9e52-13b0b8d8a9e9" id="204554"><div id="204554" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p><div><p>You can choose to add on various expansions.</p></div></div><p>Inspired by the 1981 horror RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-cthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>, Arkham Horror is a supernatural, Lovecraftian mystery game. It puts you in the shoes of an investigator, who must work through a creepy horror scenario and emerge with their body and sanity intact. You start by choosing an investigator: a Guardian, Seeker, Rogue, Mystic, Survivor, or Neutral, each of which has its specific strengths and weaknesses. Then, you investigate missing people, creepy cults, rumors of a lost ancient city, and more. It's all very evocative and tentacled. It's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">great RPG card game</a> worth getting into</p><h3><strong>Star Wars Unlimited</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="7a2d5b6c-bfd8-490b-be68-902394a3ad16" id="196833"><div id="196833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: Unlimited</h3></p><div><p>See all of the available options.</p></div></div><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-unlimited">Star Wars: Unlimited</a> is a brand new card game, but the established pre-existing universe of Star Wars makes this an excellent place to start; its longevity is nearly guaranteed, given the franchise's popularity. You play as a leader of your respective faction – the starter set includes Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Then you wage war, sending out droids and troops or using Force powers until one base is destroyed. The current set, Spark of Rebellion, focuses largely on the events of the original trilogy. The most recent expansion set, Shadows of the Galaxy, focuses on the criminal underbelly of the galaxy, and features mercenaries and bounty hunters.</p><h3><strong>Flesh and Blood</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="2178cfb3-a6dc-44f6-986f-684b5d2eca17" id="207824"><div id="207824" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Flesh and Blood: Part The Mistveil Blitz Deck Collection</h3></p><div><p>A great starting point for newcomers.</p></div></div><p>The creators of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/flesh-and-blood">Flesh and Blood</a> are traditionalists; they designed their game to be played in person – hence, in “Flesh and Blood” – rather than an online format. The game is fantasy-themed, and you have a hero who falls into one of 11 classes: Assassin, Brute, Guardian, Illusionist, Mechanologist, Merchant, Ninja, Ranger, Runeblade, Warrior, or Wizard. You equip your hero, build a deck around them, and send them into battle with spells, blows, and counterblows at the ready.</p><p><em>Kevin Wong is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in LEGO and Card Games.

<p>You deserve to play a game that runs smoothly whenever you boot it up. Unfortunately, that’s not often the case. More frequently than developers care to admit, modern video games launch unoptimized and buggy. But with a few tweaks, you can run the hottest MMORPG blowing up on Steam. Here are the best PC settings to improve performance in Throne and Liberty!</p>



<h2 id="h-recommended-pc-graphics-settings-for-throne-and-liberty">Recommended PC Graphics Settings for Throne and Liberty</h2>



<p>If you find that Throne and Liberty, the latest MMORPG published by Amazon, doesn’t run as smoothly as you’d like on PC, then you have plenty of graphical settings options to tweak. There’s a lot of choice here, allowing you to tweak the game and how it looks to your liking. These are recommendations, though.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FSR/DLSS Upscaling</strong>: Performance or Ultra Performance</li>



<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Native</li>



<li><strong>Frame Rate Limit</strong>: No Limit</li>



<li><strong>VSync</strong>: Off</li>



<li><strong>Resolution Rate</strong>: 100%</li>



<li><strong>Optimize Large-Scale Combat</strong>: On</li>

<li><strong>Visual Fidelity</strong>: Medium or Low</li>



<li><strong>Character Count</strong>: Low</li>

</ul>



<p>Nearly every other setting in the game, go ahead and change to suit your preferences and system hardware!</p>

<h2 id="h-throne-and-liberty-settings-tips">Throne and Liberty Settings Tips</h2>



<ul>
<li>To control your character and camera, I recommend using <strong>Classic Mode</strong> for greater precision and that old-school feel, especially if you’re coming from an MMORPG like World of Warcraft or EverQuest 2!</li>



<li>Turn off “<strong>Auto-Move to Interactive Target</strong>“; otherwise, you risk misclicking in the middle of combat and making a costly mistake.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-25-review-in-progress.995046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Despite some enhancements, so far this doesn’t seem like the current-gen hockey game fans have waited for.</h2></div><section><p>Every year I get my hopes up thinking, “This is it: This’ll be the year that EA’s NHL finally gets it together and delivers on its full potential,” only to then spend dozens of hours playing a game that is almost fundamentally the same as the one I played the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-24-review"><u>previous year</u></a>. There are rare exceptions to this; even though I had my issues with NHL 24, the Sustained Pressure System and Exhaustion Engine at least added something new to the overall gameplay, and NHL 21’s Be a Pro Mode has become a staple. Unfortunately, it seems like NHL 25 isn’t going to be one of those exceptions. Keep in mind that these are just my initial, early impressions of NHL 25 after just a few hours on the ice. But you only get to make one first impression, and right now I’m not feeling too optimistic.</p><p>Mechanically I’ve yet to see a lot of meaningful changes, but on the surface level, at least, it’s clear right from the start that NHL 25 is the first game in the series built exclusively for current-gen consoles. The graphics are sharp and the action looks better than ever. Animations are smoother and there’s something satisfying about seeing how much wear and tear you put on the ice. Players now look much more like humans and less like animatronics, so zoom-ins on faces will hopefully no longer provide a lot of nightmare fuel. We can’t say there’s been no positive steps made.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, Franchise is the only mode that’s been given a significant overhaul relative to last year’s version. The most immediately noticeable change is that the newly redesigned hub menu is sleeker and easier to parse. But there have also been actual gameplay additions, too. For example, GMs must convince free agents to sign with their team if the player’s interest in the organization is too low. </p><p>How they go about doing that is up to them. Maybe it’s by promising to let them play on the first line. You can attempt to charm them, but if it fails it might kill their interest in your offer entirely. And players can actually negotiate no-movement or no-trade clauses into their contracts, which is a feature that the NHL playerbase has been requesting for a while now. </p><p>GMs can also discuss what the team should be focusing on during the offseason with head coaches, which essentially provides season-wide buffs and debuffs for the team. Players can also be approached with the conversation system to let GMs develop them individually. Seasonal goals and on-ice plays can be assigned, which will lead to boosts if the player is successful. I haven’t had the time I’ve needed yet to see how much impact these types of decisions will actually have in a Franchise playthrough, so I won’t be able to say for certain if these are meaningful until my final review.</p><p>You might be wondering how Be a Pro is different this time around. Well, it’s not. Even the intro cinematics seem to be identical, which is doubly bad because I had this same complaint last year. The entire mode just seems shoehorned into each installment with the bare minimum of care or attention. I would love to have some type of story mode that was more than just text bubbles and choosing a response like in those annoying mobile game ads, but I guess that’s just not going to happen anytime soon.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It seems like it’s still stuck in the same last-gen rut.</p></div><p>So you can say I’m not wowed by what I’ve seen so far, but we’re still in the first period here: I’ve yet to touch the online modes at all, though I did briefly open a HUT Pack only to have NHL 25 crash midway through the lootbox animation. Hopefully I won’t encounter too many more glitches like that. I’ll be upfront and admit that Franchise Mode has never appealed to me too much because that type of sports sim management is not what I’m personally looking for in a hockey game – I prefer to be out on the ice than in the office – but I do plan to give it a fair shot and see if that mode finally clicks with me thanks to the new changes.</p><p>Based on what I’ve played so far, though? I’m just not feeling very impressed by NHL 25. For being the first NHL game exclusively for current-gen consoles, it’s a shame that it seems like it’s still stuck in the same last-gen rut.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/explaining-and-fixing-igns-face-off-controversy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/explaining-%E2%80%93-and-fixing-%E2%80%93-igns-face-off-controversy.995043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/explaining-and-fixing-igns-face-off-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the past few days you might’ve caught wind of some controversy stemming from IGN’s community game of the year Face-Off. It’s become a full-on drama, complete with literal ups and downs, shocking twists, and accusations of foul play flying. There’s also quite a bit of confusion, so to clear it up a bit I’m going to walk you through how we got here, and how we’re making it right.</p><p>Early this year IGN rolled out a new version of our Face-Off tool, and it’s become a pet project of mine to use it to get our community to create ranked lists of games, movies, TV shows, and literally everything else that people have opinions about. It works by showing you two things and letting you pick whichever you think should win, whether that’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/face-off-what-is-the-best-star-wars-movie-or-tv-show">The Empire Strikes Back vs Attack of the Clones</a>, or <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-the-best-call-of-duty-game-of-all-time">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011) vs Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2023)</a>. It then generates a list of your personal rankings, while also mashing your votes together with everybody else to create a community ranking. It’s far from perfect, and we hope to iterate on it so that it becomes a better experience that creates a more accurate personal list for you in fewer matches. Even so, it’s been a lot of fun to mess with and find interesting ways to use it – and to watch people agonize over tough choices between two things they love.</p><p>On February 22, after a few big 2024 games had launched, I started the <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-game-of-the-year-2024-so-far">What’s Your Game of the Year So Far? Face-Off</a> as an experiment to see how the running tally would look if we’re adding new games as they come out. Importantly, this was an informal test that asked a casual question about how people are feeling in the moment, and it was never presented as our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-community-awards-2023">official Game of the Year community vote</a>. We still plan to do that the old-fashioned way later this year, and it will be entirely separate from this. (To answer the frequently asked question of why Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is on the list when it’s a DLC expansion and not a full new game: Because there are no rules and I wanted to see what would happen! I’ll put Starfield: Shattered Space on there next week, too.) This use case technically wasn’t what the tool was built for, but I wanted to see if it would work – and the results have been promising. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This was an informal test that asked a casual question.</p></div><p>How the list shakes out is proving to be very interesting because the community ranking is based on the win/loss ratio, rather than the sheer number of votes a game receives. That means a new entry added in November can outrank something added in May simply because it wins more often, as opposed to more times. For instance, something that’s chosen as the winner in 6,500 out of 10,000 matches will outrank another item that wins 60,000 out of 100,000 matches. (It’s very silly when you add something new and it’s #1 with a 100% win ratio for a brief moment, but that quickly evens out.) So, while the hot new thing might get a lot of wins shortly after it comes out, after the honeymoon period expires and people move on to other games its ranking might fall if it’s more of a flash in the pan than something that sticks with you for a long time, as truly great games do. Ideally, people would only vote on games that they’ve actually played and disqualify the rest (using the little X in the corner of each card) so they’re not voting against something they don’t have an informed opinion on, but realistically I know the overwhelming majority is not going to do that. This is purely a popularity contest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even so, it’s been a treat to watch how things have played out, and the resulting ranking is a fascinating melding of thousands of different people’s opinions. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth had held a steady lead most of the year, but Shadow of the Erdtree was nipping at its heels for months. (See? People wanted to vote for it.) When Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Helldivers 2, Space Marine 2, Astro Bot, and Black Myth: Wukong, and other popular games came out, they shot up into the top half of the list and jockeyed for position. There were no hard rules (again, Face-Offs are a wild west territory for us!) but I mostly added games that either scored 8 or above on IGN or had proven themselves popular or at least interesting elsewhere. At the same time, I periodically pruned low-performing games from the bottom of the rankings that looked like they were never going to recover to make way for new entries and prevent the list of games from becoming unmanageably long – Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League didn’t make it, I’m afraid. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Then, late last week, it dramatically blew up.</p></div><p>Until recently, the GOTY So Far Face-Off wasn’t exactly lighting the world on fire in terms of traffic numbers (not a ton of people are looking for Game of the Year content in April). Still, it had been humming along nicely, racking up hundreds of thousands of votes, and I think there’s a lot of potential for it in the future. </p><p>Then, late last week, it dramatically blew up: The Black Myth: Wukong fandom discovered the Face-Off page and, seeing that their favorite game was within striking distance of the top of the list, rallied around it. We saw a massive influx of traffic from Chinese and other Asian sources to that page, and over the weekend Black Myth’s win percentage went from a very respectable showing in the 60s all the way up to an absolutely astronomical 90.4%, blowing past Rebirth’s relatively meager 72%. We never saw that coming, and what had been a relatively stable list was upended so quickly our scheduled social media repromotion of a Playlist built to reflect the top games – as they had been – was caught flat-footed and caused major confusion because it hadn't been updated yet. Face-Offs are dynamic and react to the community; Playlists are not and must be manually updated. We’ve learned from this that the two probably should not mix!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Aside from that wrinkle, this response to Face-Offs is exactly what I hoped would happen… but on an intensity level I hadn’t imagined. Our goal is for Face-Offs to be fun, and by golly, people were having an absolute blast with it – some were even livestreaming as they refreshed the page to see how high Black Myth could go! For the record, we don’t consider it cheating at all for fan communities to champion their game and support it by voting, and it’s actually encouraged for people to run through multiple times. (The double-bracket system we currently use means that a single run could possibly eliminate a #3 choice early on, and everything is not matched against everything, so more data gives a better picture of your preferences.) We were thrilled that so many Black Myth fans noticed the Face-Off and participated in force, and we’d love nothing more than for other fandoms to join in the fray. Friendly rivalries like that would be the best-case scenario for us, and we’d find out what other games those groups are into in the process by seeing how the rest of the list shook out. In the past few days we've gotten nearly twice as many votes on this Face-Off than it'd racked up in the previous six months.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This response to Face-Offs is exactly what I hoped would happen… but on an intensity level I hadn’t imagined.</p></div><p>But of course, this is the internet, and on the internet we know certain immutable truths. One is that online polling is not secure. Just about anything can be manipulated if someone puts their mind to it, especially if you’re not creating multiple layers of security and identity verification to lock it down. Face-Offs aren’t intended to be taken super seriously, so we don’t even require you to create an IGN account to participate – as we do with our traditional Community Game of the Year vote – because we want as many people to join in as possible. (We’d love it if you did create an account, though – it’ll save your progress on a run and your personal vote count if you’re signed in.)</p><p>Another truth is that the more people pay attention to something, the more likely it is that a bad actor tries to ruin the fun. In this case, it appears that someone – probably fully aware of how closely this page was being watched – figured out a way to quickly dump tens of thousands of votes against Black Myth: Wukong into the system, dropping it back down into the high 60s in a matter of hours. If trolling the Black Myth: Wukong fanbase during a moment of triumph was the goal here, it was extremely effective. We’ve seen a lot of anger and accusations of altering the results leveled at us, which is disappointing because again, this was all supposed to be for fun.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This was all supposed to be for fun.</p></div><p>To be explicitly clear, <strong>no one at IGN tampered with the results of this Face-Off in any way</strong> during this period. We’ve spent the past few days investigating what happened, and how we can keep Face-Offs making people happy instead of mad going forward. Here’s what the voting activity looked like on September 21 through 24, by the hour, from the top regions where people were participating. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/graph2-1727477329030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You can see the massive, sustained influx of pro-Black Myth: Wukong voters who pushed it to the top of the list, followed by a short but potent spike. That corresponds to the period where it fell back down.</p><p>The fact that Black Myth’s vote total so quickly surpassed that of games that had been accruing votes for months before it was added to the list of games strongly suggests that someone exploited the system to allow them to vote only on one specific game – something the randomization of matches is intended to prevent. Likewise, that double-elimination bracket system means you should only be able to vote against a game twice in a run before it stops showing up, since it clearly wasn’t going to be your favorite, but that also seems to have been bypassed to achieve this volume of losses in such a short time. </p><p>Unfortunately, since Face-Offs aren’t limited to logged-in users it’s not obvious which votes are real and which are fake, so we can’t simply delete the exact number of suspicious votes. However, in the interest of fairness, we’ve decided to remove all of the negative votes from the period that the Black Myth: Wukong community and our engineers have identified as the most likely to be fraudulent, during which the win percentage fell at what should’ve been an impossible rate – a total of 46,000 losses. As of this writing, that change <strong>moves Black Myth: Wukong back into the #1 position on the list</strong>, with a 76% win rate. It’s unfortunate to lose any valid votes that were caught up in the mix, but this is the best solution we have given the information available. </p><p>Over the next few months we’ll keep an eye on this Face-Off to guard against other efforts to manipulate the results. This being the internet, there’s no realistic way to prevent someone who knows what they’re doing from playing dirty tricks on a anonymous online poll, but we’ve taken steps to at least mitigate their effectiveness going forward, and we hope to continue to improve Face-Offs in a lot of different ways to make them even more fun to engage with. I hope you continue to enjoy them!</p><p>In the meantime, our What’s Your Game of the Year So Far? Face-Off continues: Yesterday I added The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (to both this Face-Off and our <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/the-legend-of-zelda-which-game-is-the-best">Zelda-specific</a> one), so if you’re playing and have an idea of where it belongs relative to other 2024 games, we’d love to have your vote. If you’re passionate about <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-movie-of-the-year-for-2024-so-far/results">movies</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-tv-show-of-the-year-for-2024-so-far/results">TV shows</a> this year, check out our Face-Offs for those as well.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-if-there-are-no-opportunities.995025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whenever there are games media layoffs these days--<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-has-more-shitty-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and really, what day aren't there any</a>--there's a certain cadence to the news. Those with their ears to the ground, or anyone following the affected writers on social media, hear about things first because a site's owners are usually too cowardly to make a public announcement. Then websites like this one report the news to a wider audience.</p><p>Then, outside of the news cycle, there's the wash. The tweets and Linkedin messages that come after. I've seen so many of them over the years that there's a definite pattern to them, all of them opening with something like "my time at GamesPub has sadly come to an end after my Slack access was removed without notice, and everything I ever wrote for the site has been deleted", and all of them ending with some variation of "I'm now open to opportunities", or "please consider me for any openings".</p><p>As someone who left the commercial side of this industry very recently, I know how important those closing lines can be. If you suddenly find yourself without a job, and you've been doing that job for years, you naturally want to keep doing that job!<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> But just as we wrote about recently with game developers</a>, when your industry is contracting as rapidly as games media is, there just aren't enough jobs to go around.</p><p>Whole networks are collapsing or being gobbled up by larger ones, and even the few big sites left routinely shed staff, to the point where it feels like there are more writers <em>out </em>of work than there are working. For the 30 people laid off at Gamurs this week, for example, what's out there? Not 30 paying jobs in games media, that's for sure. There are maybe a handful of openings worldwide, each of which probably has hundreds of applicants. Which is why those parting messages from laid off staff are always so heartbreaking: they're not being laid off from a job, but often from their <em>career</em>. </p><p>This contraction not only massively impacts those laid off, it has knock-on effects on the sites you can still read and the people who work there. Experienced leadership in the field is being thinned as callously as younger writers, while pathways for fresh talent are being bottlenecked because the few jobs that <em>are </em>out there inevitably go to more experienced, displaced writers.</p><p>This is maddening for the toll this takes on individual writers, but it's exponentially so considering how we as an industry got here. It's usually always the same story: inept ownership over-commits to an industry, sets unrealistic growth targets, misunderstands the field and the medium or, in the most explosive cases, it's all of the above. And when things inevitably go bad, it's not the bone-headed owners being "re-adjusted" or seeing their jobs "restructured". It is, like it always is, the workers paying the price.</p><p>Games media is in many respects a pretty shitty job, at least these days. It tends to be underpaid, full of abuse, exploits young writers and subjects most to the soul-crushing drudgery of posting SEO and algorithm-friendly garbage. Yet writers persist, if not for the love of writing then for the love of the medium and the hopes that <em>someone</em> out there appreciates what they've written.</p><p>And those are the challenges facing a stable job! Throw in the uncertainty and anxiety over your position at a more perilous site--or even entire network--and you can see how much of a knife's edge the entire medium of professional, written games coverage is.<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> It's no wonder there's a pipeline of writers fleeing to games development</a>; the latter might be an industry on fire, but when your own is already engulfed in flames, why not?</p><p>Everyone laid off from <em>any </em>job deserves better, but I think--and this is given my own experiences of course--being laid off from a games writing job because your owner is bad hits especially hard. Most of these sites were successful for their scale, with loyal readerships, so I can only hope that at some point in the future we can stop writing about how much this all sucks for affected writers and start writing about sites, networks, and owners who actually know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p><p>To everyone who has been laid off this week, last week or any week and found new work in the space: I'm happy you got to keep doing what you love. But for the many more who <em>haven't</em> been able to return to games media, I at least hope you've found some kind of happiness working somewhere safer, more stable and that (probably) pays better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A kid with a tiger cub pal named Noah finds him, and before long, Majima finds himself beating up a pirate captain and taking over his ship (or so it’s implied.) I got my first hands-on with the latest in the Yakuza franchise, and I’d love to tell you about it.</p><p>I played a short portion of Pirate Yakuza when Majima, Noah, and friends arrived in Infinite Wealth’s familiar locale of Honolulu, but this was very much constructed as a demo, so I can’t be certain of how similar the next series of events would be to the full game. First, a short combat tutorial on mechanics potentially unfamiliar to Infinite Wealth players: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii isn’t a turn-based RPG like Infinite Wealth, but instead an action beat-em-up like the original Yakuza games. This short tutorial primarily described Majima’s two fighting styles: Majima’s classic Mad Dog Style and the new, aptly pirate-themed Sea Dog Style. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In Sea Dog Style, Majima wields dual cutlasses, a long-range hand cannon, and a wire hook that allows you to pull in close to a targeted enemy. A cutlass can also be thrown as a boomerang if a button is held down. Combat is engaging and fun, and I can see it being varied enough to keep things interesting with just its two different styles. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dragon Kart mini-game is basically Yakuza Mario Kart, complete with boosts, drifting, coins, and items.</p></div><p>After the basic tutorial, I could choose whether to go to the fabled Madlantis to continue the story, or do one of a few side activities: Karaoke, Dragon Kart, Crazy Delivery, and fit check (change clothes). </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I don’t have quite enough experience with these mini-games in previous Yakuza games, so I couldn’t comment on whether anything substantial had changed about them, but they were all fun and worthy of spending time on for the entertainment factor alone. I can tell you that long-time Yakuza fans will definitely recognize at least some of the songs available in karaoke, though. </p><p>Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s mini-game Dragon Kart wasn’t in Infinite Wealth, making it the most far-removed of the side activities available during the demo. This absorbing mini-game is pretty built out in its own right and is basically Yakuza Mario Kart, complete with boosts, drifting, coins, and items. You can also go to a changing room to switch out Majima’s clothes for both his regular and pirate styles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In between side-activities, I became best friends with a little bird named Joseph and used the new Wire Hook while out exploring to gather a high-up butterfly. Apparently you can swing around Hawaii with it, but I didn’t see any obvious points to trigger this when I played. </p><p>Finally, for the main event, I got to see a bit of the brand new location of Madlantis. This grungy yet lively ship-graveyard-turned-mini-city-inside-a-cave-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean looks like a worthy hub. It’s at least home to Pirate Colosseum, where, in the full game, you’ll be able to engage in “intense ship battles” as the Goro Pirates. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get to try out any sort of ship battle in the demo, which was a little disappointing to say the least, but Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is ship-shaping up to be a seaworthy spin-off with a fin-favorite at its helm. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.) </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/55-lg-c4-4k-oled-tv-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is the lowest price we've seen.</h2></div><div><section><p>Ahead of the holiday season, Walmart has dropped the price of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbgwZ?object_uuid=cc4665db-5fff-4d15-af36-771e03871c71&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2024 55" LG Evo C4</a> 4K OLED TV by nearly 50% off (if you go by LG's retail price of $1999.99). Right now you can get it for $1069.00, which is easily the lowest price we've seen thus far for this particular size and model. The LG Evo C4 is an outstanding TV that has won top spots in several of our buying guides, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">best 4K TV</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">best TV for gaming</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">best TV for the PlayStation 5</a>. This is an especially good buy if you picked up the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, since the updated hardware will be able to run more games at a consistent 4K @ 120fps.</p><h2><s>5</s>5" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV: The Best PS5 TV</h2><div catalogid="4ea589e3-03a7-4c66-a69b-010ea4e2b7b6" id="207856"><div id="207856" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>55" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><p>The C4 is the current generation 2024 model among LG's highly vaunted C-series OLED TV lineup. It's an incremental upgrade over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor,  newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate. This is a true OLED TV, which is the best type of TV you can get right now. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. Compared to other OLED TVs, LG has the most generations of updates and improvements so we're keen to choose this brand over others.</p><p>The C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 144Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps and beyond. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including NVIDIA G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.</p><p>A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C4. The 55" TV weighs in at only 31.1 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.</p><h3>Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p>Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. We can honestly say that it's very possible <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a> will have lower prices on the LG C4 TV in general, however we almost never see a 55" LG OLED TV sell for under $1,000, even on older models. If you are looking for another size, waiting for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals is probably the right call. But this discount makes this easily one of the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-deals-labor-day-2024-sales"> best TV deals happening right now</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>Seven years after its initial release, Horizon Zero Dawn is getting a remastered version that upgrades its visuals and adds rebuilt and re-recorded dialogue scenes, bringing the original PlayStation 4 game more in line with its PS5 sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. If you've never played the first Horizon game, Sony will soon sell a <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1854857059163533354%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fheres-how-to-get-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-for-20-if-youre-a-new-player%2F1100-6526779%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">physical edition of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a></strong> for $50--but if you take advantage of its current upgrade track, you can nab a digital version of the remaster for a mere $20.</p><p>The trick here is to purchase the digital version of the original Horizon Zero Dawn. Sony offers an upgrade to Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PS5 for just $10, so instead of paying full price for the new game, you can buy the older, cheaper version and upgrade it. You can grab <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fhorizon-zero-dawn---playstation-4%2F141998.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fheres-how-to-get-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-for-20-if-youre-a-new-player%2F1100-6526779%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> from GameStop for just $10, so together with the upgrade, that's $20 in total.</p><p>For a slightly fuller package, there's the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fhorizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition---playstation-4%2F160630.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fheres-how-to-get-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-for-20-if-youre-a-new-player%2F1100-6526779%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition</a>, which includes the game and all its DLC. It's slightly more expensive at $20 at GameStop, so with the upgrade, it brings your total to $30--but still cheaper than buying the remaster itself. And of course, if you already own Horizon Zero Dawn either on PS4 or PC, you're already eligible for the $10 upgrade. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is set to launch on October 31.</p><p>It's been a big week for the Horizon series. Alongside the announcement of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play livestream</a>, the publisher also announced Lego Horizon Adventures, a Lego game take on the franchise. That synergy makes sense, as Horizon is already big among Lego fans, thanks to a bunch of sets that let you build its iconic robot creatures--and they're pretty impressive.</p><p>Leading the pack is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-zero-dawn-tallneck-set-restocked-before-lego-horizon-adventures/1100-6526690/" data-ref-id="1100-6526690">1,222-piece Lego Tallneck</a>, which is only available at Amazon. You can get it for $105, which is a little more than the $90 it cost when it was first released. The increase appears to be part of Amazon's exclusivity, but the set is Prime-eligible for free shipping, and is still cheaper than trying to get it from a reseller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375321-horizontallnecklego.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375321" data-ratio="1.0141987829615" data-width="1479" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375321-horizontallnecklego.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375321"></a><figcaption>Lego Tallneck from Horizon Forbidden West</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375321-horizontallnecklego.jpg"></figure><p>The Horizon franchise also has action figures, graphic novels, and board games to keep you busy.
