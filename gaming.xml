            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-technoblade-tribute-pig-crown-1851775077<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a scene quite early on in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> that, to the unaware, would completely pass you by. As Jack Black’s Steve introduces the newly arrived humans to his village, young teenager Henry sees a pig walk past wearing a crown. He asks, “Is he some kind of king?” And for those in the know, the blubbing begins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re a follower of <em>Minecraft</em> on YouTube, or the parent of one, you’ll inevitably have heard of Technoblade. The YouTuber, whose real name was Alexander, tragically died from cancer in 2022, aged only 22. A member of Dream SMP, which featured many of the biggest names in the field, Technoblade became known for his incredible skill at the game, and for a YouTube channel with 11 million subscribers.</p><p>Since his untimely death, Technoblade has been canonized by his contemporaries and followers, his name spoken with a lovely reverence. My own kid, only really getting into <em>Minecraft </em>YouTube since Technoblade’s passing, has learned this reverential tone and almost whispers his name. The point is, he was a great YouTuber, respected by his peers, and someone who actively fought against fame for the protection of his family. (His first name only became known after he died, and his last name is still unknown.) One of the many lines of text that can appear when you launch <em>Minecraft </em>reads “Technoblade never dies!”</p><p>So back to that scene in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. The bejeweled pig that Henry spots is a reference to Technoblade, whose in-game avatar was a bipedal pig wearing a crown (as seen in the image at the top of this article). The character asks, “Is he some kind of king?”</p><p>“No,” says Jack Black, before a long pause. Then with gravitas adds, “He’s a <em>legend</em>.”</p><p>You can see the moment in somewhat dubiously sourced footage in the following video:</p><p>Before the line had been delivered, just when the pig appeared on screen, all around me in the movie theater I heard kids going, “Technoblade!” with absolute delight in their voices. My son leant over to me and whispered with wide eyes, “That was Technoblade! That pig was Technoblade!” When he explained the reference to my wife in the parking lot as we left, and then solemnly delivered the “No, he’s a legend” line, she cried. She’d never even heard of him before, but the sincerity and touching nature of the tribute—it’s making me well up a bit as I type.</p><p>It turns out it’s only in the movie thanks to the kid playing Henry. According to an interview with director Jared Hess <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Collider</em></a></span>, Sebastian Hansen approached him during the film’s prep and said, “Look, there’s this amazing <em>Minecraft</em> player named Technoblade who passed away, and I would love to be able to honor him somehow in the film.” Hess says he spoke with the design team, and they worked it all out.</p><p>It’s fun to note there were many other easter eggs hidden in there for <em>Minecraft</em> diehards, like a Totem of Undying in Steve’s collection that would make the characters’ journey so much easier if only they knew what it was. And there was another theaterful of excited murmuring when Mojang’s Jens Bergensten appears as a silent waiter in a blink-or-miss-it moment. But of all the film’s fleeting nods to this or that, the tribute to Technoblade is the most special, and no doubt the one that will cause the most lips to quiver with emotion.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s stock prices have continued to fall, hitting a 12-year low on both the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBI-FR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paris Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">London Stock Exchange</a>. As of the markets closing in the region, Ubisoft stock is trading under €9 for the first time since April 2013.</p>



<p>As of publishing, the stock is sitting at €8.80 after falling another 7.83% on Monday. At one point it sat at €8.27 before it rose back to the closing number.</p>



<p>The reasons for the continued drop of Ubisoft’s stock prices should be surprising to anyone who has followed the company over the years. Since April 2024, Ubisoft’s shares have fallen 62.9% from its 52-week high of €23.70 to the €8.80 it currently sits. The company’s shares fell under €10 back in late October 2024 when it was announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows would be delayed to 2025. However, it rebounded slightly back to over €14 per share not long after.</p>







<p>Fast forward to late March and early April, the company’s prices continued to gradually drop again. The big drop came, however, after Ubisoft announced it had reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Tencent</a> on a new subsidiary that would include the publisher’s three biggest franchises—Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin’s Creed—and give Tencent a 25% stake in the new venture. After a slight uptick, stock prices fell from €13.15 on March 27, the day of the deal, to €10.70 in just three days of trading. Since then, the prices continued to fall to what they are now. </p>



<p>There’s also the global uncertainty surrounding a potential recession that has the entire market falling over the last handful days. </p>



<p>Do you make anything of Ubisoft’s stock prices continuing to fall lately? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

Officially announced in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-hearts-fortnite-festival-in-season-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Fortnite website, the artist will headline Fortnite Festival Season 8 as this season's Icon, beginning on April 8.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Festival is sort of like a Rock Band-like game mode that lives within Fortnite and lets up to four players perform together online.

Of course, the biggest selling point is the ability to play as Sabrina herself, who comes with two skins (each with two color variations) based on outfits from her recent Short n’ Sweet tour.</p><p>To purchase the music pass, Fortnite players need 1,400 V-Bucks (roughly $13). After that, players will immediately unlock the yellow babydoll Sabrina Carpenter Outfit--with an included Lego Style. The outfit resembles the one she wore on her most recent tour. At the end of the pass, players will receive a similar bodysuit, another look from her tour.</p><p>One of the bigger changes coming this season will be the renaming of Fortnite emotes; all of those that include dancing will now be aptly called dance emotes in the Locker. While using a dance emote, any player can do the same dance with you--even if they don't own the emote. There will be two Sabrina-inspired dance emotes this season: the Taste Emote and the Please Please Please Emote, which are each choreographed to the song they're tied to.</p><p>As the season progresses, players can unlock more Sabrina goodies like a skirt and boots inspired by another tour look. This has a pink default Style, a Baby Blue alt Style, and another Lego version. There will also be a matching lipstick-stained purse with both pink and blue stylings. Lastly, customizations like her own Battle Bus contrail and microphone.</p><p>Since launching in late 2023, Fortnite Festival has been bringing in a new headlining artist every three months or so. The current season is headlined by virtual pop star <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassin-creed-shadows-latest-patch-brings-fan-requested-features-and-ps5-pro-improvements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has released another patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and it's the game's most substantial update yet, introducing a range of fan-requested features alongside the likes of enhancements to improve visual fidelity on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ever since Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch at the end of last month, fans have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">sharing their wishlist of features</a>, and Ubisoft has clearly been listening. As of today's 1.0.2 update, for instance, the "follow path" option seen in previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> has returned, and mounts can now Auto-Follow the road to a marked destination when the pathfinder is enabled. Additionally, horse speeds have now been increased in cities.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, players can now reset Mastery Nodes in Naoe and Yasuke's skill trees if they fancy trying out different playstyles, and it's also now possible to sell and dismantle multiple items to save time. That applies both when trading with merchants and when dismantling items at the Hideout's Forge. And here's another time-saving addition: update 1.0.2 now lets players quickly access the Investigation Board by holding down the Option button for a few seconds.

<p>
As for those aforementioned PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, patch 1.0.2 introduces PSSR - which will need to be manually enabled if you've already been playing on the console - and adds Raytraced Specular support to Balanced mode. This, says Ubisoft, will bring visual fidelity closer to PS5 Pro's Quality mode than Performance mode.
</p>
<p>
There's actually quite a bit more going on in patch 1.0.2, too, including the removal of the 30fps frame rate cap while in the Hideout when using Performance mode on consoles. That's in addition to boss fight balancing, improved Double Assassinations, and improvements to Naoe's responsiveness "in some instances". All the above arrives alongside a sizeable list of bug fixes, as <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/2FUDlIPb2uWk5Ldb8OhKej">detailed in Ubisoft's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shadows creative director Jonathon Dumont previously discussed Ubisoft's plans to address fan-requested features post-launch, noting the studio was "always listening and monitoring what players are doing" and considering "constructive feedback". Dumont did, for instance, confirm Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-actively-looking-at-adding-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode">"actively looking at" introducing a tougher difficulty</a>, although that particular addition sounds like it might be further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows has, of course, got off to a strong start, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">topping over 2m players</a> in its first couple of days - a figure Ubisoft says means it's "now surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey". Its critical reception has been positive too, with Eurogamer's Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">calling Shadows "majestic in scope" and "impressive in detail" in his four star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-ones-michael-sarnoski/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When the announcement was made that a<a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/"> Death Stranding film</a> adaptation was in the works, fans immediately assumed that Hideo Kojima would direct the film and potentially even pen the script. Kojima's well-known love for movies and cinema had everyone assuming he'd be in the driver's seat for the adaptation.</p>
<p>That's not the case, though, as Kojima explicitly said at <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">2024's Tokyo Game Show</a> that he absolutely does not have time to direct the movie himself. He also explained that because he had originally viewed the story of Death Stranding as a game, it wasn't in his interest to "<em>look back at it and try to see it from a movie perspective.</em>"</p>
<p>That is why the search for a director would go beyond Kojima, and as&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a> reported on Monday, the search is over. Michael Sarnoski, the director of A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig, has been chosen to write and direct the Death Stranding film adaptation.</p>
<p>According to the report, the adaptation will "<em>delve into the mysteries surrounding the 'Death Stranding' - a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.</em>"</p>
<p>It's been more than two years since the film adaptation of Death Stranding was announced, and now that the project has a writer and director confirmed, it'll likely be another two years at least, before we can expect to see any news regarding a release date.</p>
<p>Sarnoski also won't be jumping on the project until he's wrapped up post-production work on his next upcoming film, Death of Robin Hood, which is also being produced by A24. At least now we know that real work on the project can move forward with Sarnoski officially at the helm. The next big question is whether the star-studded cast from the game will return for the film.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kojima Productions is currently finishing its work on Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 26</a> for PlayStation 5.</p>

You can even break off chunks of the world and use that to destroy stuff.

If you go off and explore a corner of the map for 30 minutes, when you return to where you started you’ll see all the damage you previously wrought. And all of this devastation is recreated in real-time in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>’s in-game map!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-recommend-id="image://13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-recommend-id="image://13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Not only can you punch and destroy nearly every square inch of the levels in <em>Bananza</em>, but all this material behaves differently depending on what it is. </p><p>For example, a chunk of soft mud can’t break hard rock or metal, but you can toss it at enemies or walls and it will stick. On the flip side, harder materials can be ripped out of the ground and used as temporary hammers to increase Donkey Kong’s destructive power. It’s the kind of feature that’s hard to sell in a trailer but will likely help the game feel more next gen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-recommend-id="image://8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-recommend-id="image://8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Bananza </em>you don’t simply have a punch button.

Whatever you feel like.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-recommend-id="image://b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-recommend-id="image://b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Why is Donkey Kong destroying everything? What is his motivation? Well, he’s trying to collect a new material that has appeared call Banandium.

                <p>Nintendo confirmed to GameSpot that it is actively in discussion with developers whose Nintendo Switch games have compatibility issues on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Shortly after last week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, a webpage emerged outlining all of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/?srsltid=AfmBOoo_ZVigsmweA5nha09wz_OJkAt0gSkOMUUwBmKy0Fj0iOyST8W0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch games with compatibility issues</a> on the Switch 2. Although the majority of the original Switch's library is compatible with the new piece of Nintendo hardware, some titles have in-game compatibility issues while others have problems just starting up in the first place. These problems aren't just popping up for obscure indies either.</p><p>Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/another-crabs-treasure/" data-ref-id="5000-564470">Another Crab's Treasure</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> are having problems with start-up, while titles such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harvestella/" data-ref-id="5000-566601">Harvestella</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overcooked-all-you-can-eat/" data-ref-id="5000-516001">Overcooked: All You Can Eat</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stumble-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-535994">Stumble Guys</a> have in-game compatibility issues. In an interview with Nintendo's Technology Development Division General Manager Tetsuya Sasaki, GameSpot asked if Nintendo was in discussions with and offering insights to the developers behind these Switch games with Switch 2 compatibility issues.</p><p>"Yes, Nintendo has worked very hard at figuring out how to make a wide variety of games compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2," Sasaki explained. "And as the Nintendo Switch 2 became more and more complete and entered its final form, we really realized how important it is for us to work very closely together with our third-party partners. And that is how this list came about."</p><p>While some third-party developers are disappointed that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smaller-game-studios-are-struggling-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-report/1100-6530621/" data-ref-id="1100-6530621">haven't received development kits</a> for Switch 2 yet, Sasaki's comments show that Nintendo wants to work closely with its third-party partners to ensure games run well on its latest hardware.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5.

                <p>Nintendo's full unveiling of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> finally answered the mystery of what the new C button was for: a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/" data-ref-id="1100-6530539">new GameChat function</a>, which will let you easily talk with friends, share your screen in group sessions, or even show your face if you purchase a camera peripheral. But the GameChat shown during the debut stream was less than stellar, with a noticeably choppy framerate. Nintendo told GameSpot in an interview that it intentionally made GameChat the smallest footprint possible, to save system resources for the games themselves.</p><p>"In order to explain this well, I think it might first help to explain about the resources the system has," Switch 2 hardware director Takuhiro Dohta said, via a translator. "So obviously, chat is meant to run and work simultaneously and coincide with the game you're playing. But we also think it's critical that it doesn't get in the way of the game that's running right now. And so we wanted to definitely make sure we do was to make sure that running game chat alongside the game doesn't result in the game experience or quality being reduced at all in any way.</p><p>"So from a system resource perspective, obviously even the Nintendo Switch had a set of system resources that it needed to tap into to run the system. And now that we have Nintendo Switch 2, there is bigger, more, basically resource budget to use. However, even with that enhanced and larger budget, we try to use as little of that as possible. And they made it happen somehow. And within that small slice of the resource budget, there's other things to take into consideration, like network systems, all that kind of stuff, and all of that taking into account is where we landed in terms of quality of the video that you saw in the footage."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVjRBTy5irI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Technical director Tetsuya Sasaki added that Nintendo puts a priority on making sure experiences are kept consistent between players, which led to the decision to keep the GameChat footprint small.</p><p>"As Nintendo, one thing we really put emphasis on is making sure that everyone experiences a very even experience when it comes to the quality of service that they're experiencing," Sasaki said. "And based on this emphasis that we prioritize--obviously if somebody is in a better environment, they're going to get better results in terms of their experience--but we really wanted to make sure that more than anything people had an equal or even playing field, or even experience, rather. And I think that was our priority as an entertainment company.</p><p>"And the other aspect of this is that we want to make sure that there is enough power reserved for the games themselves. And so we have a smaller area to play around in within to make sure that all these varying aspects to fit into, things like network environment connectivity. And so we landed on within this margin that we have to work within, this is a good even experience that we can provide."</p><p>Sasaki said that this consideration was especially important going forward, as games will continue to get increasingly complex and system intensive on Switch 2.</p><p>"Another important thing is that with the Nintendo Switch 2 we're going to see more and more titles come out," he said. "And again, we really want to make sure that reservation of space is going to them. And so that's another factor here for us."</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 is coming on June 5. Preorders had been expected to begin this week, with the system priced at $450 for the base model and $500 for a bundle that includes a digital copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>. However, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delayed the preorder date</a> in light of tariffs from President Trump, saying it needs to take time to evaluate the "potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." That suggests the price may be under review, and we could see it increase.</p><p>We're also getting more details from Nintendo developers due to interviews conducted at the reveal event. Among other things we've learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-switch-games-could-get-performance-boost-without-paid-switch-2-upgrades/1100-6530656/" data-ref-id="1100-6530656">Switch 1 games could get a boost on Switch 2</a> even without paid upgrades, that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">game key-carts won't be tied</a> to your Switch Online account, and in case you were curious, yes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/" data-ref-id="1100-6530649">Switch 2 carts still taste terrible</a>.</p><p>We got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">hands-on with the Switch 2</a> and found it doesn't pack many surprises, but it does feel like a worthwhile upgrade to the original Switch. The debut event also had several upcoming games to try out, including the aforementioned Mario Kart World and the wildly destructive Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Hands-On: Facing 18 Years Of Expectations</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li></ul>

            <p>
The next popstar joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is Sabrina Carpenter, the Grammy-winning artist behind Espresso, Taste and Please Please Please.
</p>
<p>
Carpenter will become the next star of Fortnite Festival, complete with her own skins, musical battle pass and tracks to play in the game's Guitar Hero-esque mode.
</p>
<p>
Her arrival follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">season headlined by Japanese virtual popstar Hatsune Miku</a>, and follows previous artists such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-from-lady-gagas-infamous-tweet-fortnite-fans-think-a-concert-is-really-happening">Lady Gaga</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-than-10m-fortnite-players-watch-snoop-dogg-ice-spice-headline-concert-streamed-live-from-times-square">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">Billie Eilish</a>.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
The upcoming Music Pass will include Carpenter's tracks Juno and Nonsense, as well as a skin you can then use throughout Fortnite. So, yes, Carpenter will soon be able to crank 90s alongside Jonesy, Peely and Fishstick.
</p>
<p>
Fun fact: Fortnite is actually Carpenter's second video game appearance, after previously popping up in 2011's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-dance-kids">Just Dance Kids</a> 2 as a coach.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's main battle royale mode is a few weeks away from finishing its current season. Persistent internet whispers suggest something different will arrive on its Island next: a shorter mini-season entirely dedicated to Star Wars.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/monster-energy-supercross-25-review-a-solid-return-to-the-track/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time in two years, Supercross fans have a new game in Monster Energy Supercross 25. A game built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, developer Milestone has taken what made the series fun in the past and worked to expand in ways to add to the longevity of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just how much fun is the first official Supercross game since 2023? In many ways it’s the best Supercross game Milestone has ever put out. In others, it leaves a lot to be desired.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-energy-supercross-25-review">Monster Energy Supercross 25 Review</h2>



<p>Before diving into the modes, let’s talk about the gameplay. Monster Energy Supercross 25 is one of the more difficult racing games to get the hang of. But don’t let that scare you, that’s not a bad thing. Nor does that mean it’s not beginner friendly.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve never played a Supercross game before or it’s been years since the last one you touched, the settings available to you make it so you can have the easiest time of your life whipping around each track on your way to first place. Playing like that, however, quickly becomes boring, and you’ll want more of a challenge. And make no mistake about it, a challenge you will get.</p>



<p>From timing your acceleration out of a turn on a rain-soaked track to hitting the whoops in a way that keeps you from losing momentum, every single area on the track requires precision. I can’t begin to count the number of times I dumped my bike because I thought I could take a sharp turn like I was the world’s greatest racer. Fall after fall after fall in my first handful of races—I’m looking at you, Daytona—saw every opponent fly past as I watched my top 5 finish vanish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you get the hang of how each bike feels and reacts to your riding, you’ll find yourself improving in both control and speed. Nothing’s more satisfying than hitting a personal-best lap time on a track you’ve struggled with time and time again. Pair that with tracks that change on a lap-by-lap basis, and it makes success even more rewarding. That euphoric feeling you get after that first major win is something that’s hard to replicate in racers, and Supercross 25 does it well.</p>



<p>Without question, the franchise’s jump up to Unreal Engine 5 has not only improved the overall visual fidelity where the tracks and drivers look the best they ever have, but it’s helped the gameplay become the best it’s ever been. And it’s not even close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presentation itself is similar to what it had been. The commentary you hear only comes in before and after a race while the actual race is focused just on the action at hand. It’s fine, but nothing to write home about.</p>



<p>Of course, there are a couple frustrations with gameplay such as hitting a jump and landing directly on the head of the rider in front of you only to bounce off and keep going. Or when you are racing hard and simply bounce off the side of the rider next to you without even a little bit of slowdown. It’s little things like that that can hurt the on-track immersion that Supercross 25 is going for. Thankfully, it didn’t happen enough to ruin the on-track fun.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Racing in the rain presents its own challenge.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-an-unfulfilling-career">An Unfulfilling Career</h3>



<p>Where the fun does kind of take a back seat is with Supercross 25’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-energy-supercross-25-career-mode-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career mode</a>. The mode you’ll likely spend the most time in, the premise is simple: start in the Futures and work your way up to the 450 series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the surface, it looks like there’s a lot here. There are rivalries, team goals to achieve, sponsorship opportunities, social media to track, and more. The problem is that it’s all surface-level material. There’s no real meat to the career mode bones here.</p>



<p>First, rider customization might be the most limited in any sport game. I get that you don’t really see their face as you race, but having a bit more freedom would’ve been nice to have.</p>



<p>All the mode feels like as you progress through is one where you’re just trying to impress a team enough to give you your next contract. You constantly are looking at what’s out there and what it would take for a specific team to be interested in you. Some might want you to win your races while others just want consistent Top 10 or Top 5 finishes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>Everything is centered around the career hub.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each season of your career is split up into Acts that ends in a Climax with a specific goal based on what’s happened in the prior races. It adds a bit of intrigue and breakup to a mode that could start to feel monotonous without it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way your career is broken up is in the form of motocross races and even rhythm attack events. They help you increase your fan count, which builds up your notoriety, but I failed to see where it actually impacts what happens throughout your career. It didn’t seem to increase/decrease the likelihood of signing with a better team. All that mattered was the performance on the track. Even in my limited social media responses where I intentionally tried to be the biggest jerk I possibly could, it still didn’t negatively affect me enough to warrant changing my plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, the career mode just feels like something’s missing. Even upgrading your bike doesn’t feel as deep as it could. It’s just: choose your upgrade, wait, repeat.</p>



<p>I’m not saying I want a cutscene-filled story mode—I’m the furthest from a fan of that—but I would’ve liked more interaction with other drivers and more consequences. Any sort of poor performance on the track felt more like a bump in the road than anything to really be worried about. That takes out any potential drama that a career mode should include. There’s a solid foundation here for a truly great career mode, but this year’s isn’t it.</p>



<p>Outside of the career mode, there’s not much that will keep you busy aside from the one-off race weekends and a very barebones online multiplayer at launch. Multiplayer is expected to get updates post launch, but it’s nothing more than private lobbies and unranked races at the moment.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-energy-supercross-25-review-verdict">Monster Energy Supercross 25 Review Verdict</h2>



<p>As mentioned at the beginning, Monster Energy Supercross 25 is the best Supercross game that Milestone has put out in so many ways. The racing is rewarding as you get the hang of it, and the visuals are second-to-none. Unfortunately, the career mode leaves you just wishing for more to do with the rest of the game feeling quite empty.</p>



<p>For that, it’s tough to recommend it as a day one purchase unless you are a diehard fan yearning to get back on the track. If not, it’s a game worth playing for sure, just after it drops a bit in price or <a href="https://milestone.it/news/supercross-25/post-launch-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">planned DLC updates</a> add more to do outside of career mode and in multiplayer.</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT:</strong> WAIT</p>

                <p>The long-rumored remake of Bethesda's popular 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion continues to come into focus. Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb offered an update on the project today during GameBreaking News, saying he expects the game to release soon.</p><p>In fact, Grubb said he expects Bethesda to shadowdrop the game "at any moment this month." That means Bethesda would announce and release the game at or around the same time, it appears.</p><p>This tracks with previous rumors and reports that said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rumored-oblivion-remake-could-launch-sooner-than-expected/1100-6530081/" data-ref-id="1100-6530081">Bethesda might announce and release the game close together</a>, at some point in April.

Now through April 22, ESO players can earn a variety of rewards and buffs as part of the celebration.</p><p>It's been reported that Virtuous developed the apparent Oblivion remake, and that it was "fully remade" with Unreal Engine 5 and featuring a variety of re-worked gameplay systems. Some thought Microsoft and Bethesda would reveal an Oblivion remake during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct in January, but that did not happen.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411" data-ratio="0.60619872379216" data-width="1097" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411"></a><figcaption>Is an Oblivion remake/remaster in the works?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg"></figure><p>The rumor dates back to documents from the Microsoft vs. FTC case in 2023 concerning the Xbox company's proposed buyout of Activision Blizzard. "Oblivion Remaster" was listed as an upcoming unannounced Bethesda game for release in financial year 2022. Obviously, that did not happen.</p><p>There is no word on potential platforms for the rumored Oblivion remake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-missing-a-few-big-features-fans-were-hoping-for/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is definitely a feature-rich console, with improvements over the original that will make hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of players want to buy the console on day one.</p>
<p>That's not to say the Nintendo Switch 2 will have everything players hoped for. Namely, there are three big features that we now know the Nintendo Switch 2 will be missing that players were hoping for. Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/category/news/">VGC</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 will not feature Hall-Effect sticks in the new Joy-Con 2 controllers. There will also be no console-wide achievements on the Nintendo Switch 2. Lastly, the Nintendo eShop will seemingly remain without life and personality, as Nintendo confirms the iconic eShop music from the Wii days is not coming back.</p>
<p><span>Going from least to most impactful, regarding the eShop's lack of music, the producer on the Nintendo Switch 2, Kouichi Kawamoto, explained to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a> that the reason comes down to games on the eShop now having videos to go along with the screenshots.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games. We didn't want to intrude on that, so we don't have music there."</em></p>
<p>Next, regarding the lack of achievements, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen offered no explanation as to why they aren't there, and instead just confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements">Polygon</a>, when asked if there would be achievements, "<em>Nope</em>."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the lack of Hall-Effect sticks,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a> confirmed that the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not feature them. Senior Vice President of Product Development and Publishing Nate Bihldorff gave the final word.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up. They're not Hall-Effect sticks, but they feel really good."</em></p>
<p>So the threat of stick drift remains for the Joy-Con 2 controllers, which are, like everything else about this new console, more expensive than the original Switch controllers. This also confirms that the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">rumor</a> that the Joy-Con 2 controllers would feature Hall-Effect sticks was false.</p>

A24 has announced that Michael Sarnoski will both direct and write the project. Sarnoski’s previous work includes directing the surprisingly stunning Nicolas Cage drama <em>Pig</em> and monster movie thriller <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">Death Stranding,</a></em> released in 2019, tells the story of Sam Porter Bridges (voiced and performed by Norman Reedus), a porter tasked with ferrying packages across a devastated United States. Along the way he is assaulted by oily-looking monsters called BTs, rain that makes you old, and more conventional enemies including a terrorist sect led by a man named Higgs who is played by Troy Baker. The game went on to critical success, winning several Game Awards and netting Kojima an award for best direction. A sequel,<em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em> has been announced and launches June 26th.</p><p>The <em>Death Stranding</em> movie was announced in 2023. Kojima, an ardent lover of cinema, announced the feature-length production would be headed by A24 with a shirt featuring dripping letters similar to the logo for <em>Death Stranding.</em> A24, an independent production company, is known for championing quirky, weird, and downright disturbing films like <em>Hereditary</em>, <em>Everything Everywhere, All at Once</em>, and the forthcoming <em>Death of a Unicorn</em>.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>, with its surrealist visuals and storytelling, feels like a good fit for Sarnoski.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/640021/simcity-4-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Search for “SimCity 4” on YouTube, and you’ll see players constructing multilevel highway interchanges and intricate railroad networks, or maybe even a swooping flyby of a sprawling metropolis. None of these features came with the original game, which was released just after the turn of the millennium. They’ve been developed slowly and painstakingly over the 22 years since its release by dedicated aficionados — a thriving community that continues to push the game’s limits.</p><p>The work is a labor of love, and it’s a lot of labor and love. Modder Tarkus says that after all these years, he’s drawn to the deep and complex nature of the game’s simulation, which he says remains unmatched by newer games like <em>Cities: Skylines</em> (2015) and its sequel <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> (2023) — and even by <em>SimCity 4</em>’s own sequel, which was released in 2013 and simply called <em>SimCity</em>. Modder Ulisse Wolf says that, for him, it’s ultimately a question of community. Perhaps because of the game’s age, he finds that <em>SimCity 4</em> enthusiasts are “more mature … guaranteeing you a quiet place to live in [peace] with other members.”</p><p><em>SimCity 4</em> was released in 2003, the fourth in game company Maxis’ series of city-building games. It was reasonably successful, garnering positive reviews and selling well enough for Maxis to release an expansion pack later that year. The ability for players to add their own content to the game was a key part of <em>SimCity 4</em>’s appeal from the start: it came with a set of tools that allowed players to create and add their own buildings to their cities. Players soon began sharing their creations online via exchanges hosted on fan sites like <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/">Simtropolis</a> and SC4 Devotion (now defunct, but relaunched recently as <a href="https://www.sc4evermore.com/">SC4 Evermore</a>), as well as discussing tips and ideas in the accompanying forums.</p><div><p>“It became clear to me that if I wanted to see more happen on the transportation modding front, I needed to learn how to do things for myself.”</p></div><p>Players soon began to look beyond the officially supported methods of adding their own content to the game and wondering what else could be done. Could the game’s road system be expanded? What about the railways? Early modding efforts were made easier by the way the game stores its data, which, as modder Matias93 explains, is in a database whose format was shared with previous Maxis games. The database stores information about the game’s various elements: for a type of road, the database would have entries for everything from which textures to display on screen when the player placed the road down to how much traffic the simulation would allow it to carry.</p><p>The game’s built-in tools provided no way to access this database, so the community developed its own — no easy task, as Matias93 explains: “[This] required the development of a veritable suite of tools able to decrypt hexadecimal symbols into legible databases, and to import and export multimedia files from and to them.”</p><p>As early modders began to find their way around the database, however, they started to find entries for systems that weren’t in the game: features that were either unfinished or never implemented. “<em>SimCity 4</em> shows clear signs of having gotten less content and expansions than its creators [intended]. While some of these elements are almost irremediably broken … many others were relatively at reach to be repurposed,” Matias93 says.</p><p>Using the tools they’d developed to tweak existing entries, modders were able to build the rudiments of these unfinished features into entirely new ones. One of the first such features to be repurposed was an unused road type, apparently intended to be a dirt road for use in rural environments. <em>SimCity 4</em> comes with several types of roads for players to place in their cities: suburban streets, two-lane roads, two-lane one-way roads, four-lane avenues, and highways. Players soon chafed against the limitations of the latter: there was no way to build a highway with a variety of lane widths, and connecting a highway to a road network required the use of one of several prebuilt interchanges. Players who wanted to design and build their own interchanges, or construct highways with a variety of widths, were out of luck.</p><p>The discovery of the unused dirt road meant that there was space for one more road type, and modders used it as the basis for what became the “real highway” mod, a more flexible and customizable alternative to the game’s built-in highway system. Suddenly, players had multiple highway widths to choose from, as well as modular pieces they could use to build their own custom interchanges. </p><p>Tarkus recalls coming across an early version of the mod in 2006: “I was absolutely floored. [Even though] it was an extremely limited mod at the time, I could tell it had potential.” Real-life commitments took him away from the game for most of that year, and on his return, he found that development had stalled. “It became clear to me that if I wanted to see more happen on the transportation modding front, I needed to learn how to do things for myself.”</p><p>Today, Tarkus is the lead developer on the <a href="https://www.sc4nam.com/">Network Addon Mod (NAM)</a>, a sprawling package that includes the RHW mod along with a huge amount of other transport-based content: pedestrian malls, a new railway system, roundabouts, canals, bridges, and underpasses, as well as a comprehensive reworking of the game’s traffic simulator. The mod remains in active development — its 49th version was released in March 2025 — and is maintained and developed by a constantly shifting and evolving team, whose membership spans the globe.</p><p>Lucario Boricua, who spearheads development on several of the mod’s features, lives in Puerto Rico and is a civil engineer by day. He estimates that, as of early 2025, the team has around 25 full-fledged members, along with other part-time contributors, playtesters, etc. The community is friendly in general, too — members gather in both the long-running forums and newer channels like Discord, and both are generally nice places to spend time, with veteran members welcoming new fans and what Wolf calls “political bullshit” notably absent. </p><p>It’s not just the NAM that remains in active development, either. In 2025, <em>SimCity 4 </em>modding continues to evolve and encompass new possibilities, largely because of improved access to the game’s source code. Matias93 explains that “the first 15 years of modding, more or less, [had nothing] to do with coding <em>per se.</em>” Instead, they involved customizing and extending the game’s databases. However, that changed in the 2010s because of two key developments.</p><p>The first was the<a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/39345-the-blsmm-thread-now-with-dll-loading/?tab=comments#comment-1005770"> release of a portion of the game’s code</a>, provided by the late Paul Pedriana — the game’s original chief programmer — in response to a request from the community. This allowed for the reimplementation of some of the game’s <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/">internal debugging features</a>, which were essentially cheat codes that allowed developers to do things like quickly set up cities without worrying about practicalities like having enough in-game cash, place specific buildings instantly, and many other useful features. Then, in 2019, a 64-bit macOS port of the game was released — with an unexpected bonus for modders. “A lot of the game code [was] legible on the released executable, allowing modders to identify certain possible hooks to work with,” Matias93 says.</p><p>Modders continue to lack full access to the game’s code, but even limited access has allowed the use of techniques that would have otherwise been impossible. Foremost among these is the use of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/setup-upgrade-and-drivers/dynamic-link-library">dynamic link libraries</a> (DLLs), which allow custom code to be loaded into the game’s executable at runtime. The ability to write custom DLLs has allowed modders to <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30883-sc4fix-third-party-patches-for-sc4/">fix long-standing bugs</a> in the game — most notably, one <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/74667-revisiting-prop-pox-and-prop-theory/">notorious issue</a> that could lead to save game corruption in large cities. It also let them dream up features that would not have been possible otherwise: recent additions include a 3D camera, the reimplementation of the game’s long-broken water system, and a Steam Workshop-esque interface for finding and downloading custom content.</p><p>Nevertheless, the process of creating these features remains far less straightforward than for modern games, which often come with dedicated development kits designed for modders’ use. So what is it that keeps the NAM team and its fellow modders working on <em>SimCity 4</em>, painstakingly implementing new features and testing the limits of what’s possible?</p><p>Lucario Boricua says that working on the game today feels like “standing on the shoulders of giants.” The decades of work that modders have put into the game provide a platform for today’s creators to push the game into places its designers probably never imagined: “We’re focused on doing revolutionary things that redefine what’s possible.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Reburn's posh-looking near-future shooter La Quimera now has a release date - April 25th 2025. Which is mighty soon for an FPS project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">we first heard about this very February</a>, though nothing to be alarmed by - it's been in development since around 2020.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Reburn are a rebrand of Metro studio 4A Games Ukraine - they're not to be confused with 4A Games in Malta, who are still working on the Metro series. La Quimera doesn't look much like Metro. I compared it to Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in our announcement post, and the below trailer's worth of exosuit punching and heatvision railgunnery is doing nothing to dissipate that characterisation.

La Quimera is set "in and around the fictional Latin American mega-city of Nuevo Caracas". You and up to two of your friends play members of a PMC group "caught up in a vast conflict between rival factions and shadowy corporations, as mystical events increasingly blur the line between reality and illusion". (OK, the last part is perhaps more Black Ops 3 than Advanced Warfare.)</p>
<p>Care of a mysterious benefactor, you've got a slick mecha-onesie with the power to go invisible, and a bunch of guns that look like mating stealth bombers. The game's world and narrative feature writing from Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn - who, now that I think of it, has also contributed his likeness to Hideo Kojima's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> games. One suspects that Refn might be trying to Do A Vin Diesel and reinvent himself as a video game guy.
</p>
<p>
Reburn remain based in Kyiv, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-air-attack-kyiv-ukraines-military-says-2025-04-06/">struck just today by Russian missiles</a> in the course of Russia's three-year-old assault on its smaller neighbour. "As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry," CEO Dmytro Lymar comments in a statement.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to try those exosuits on for size, the developers are running a closed 24 hour Steam beta for La Quimera, starting April 12th at 7am PT, 3pm BST or 4pm CEST. It'll support co-op. Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam</a>.

And a key source of tension in matches will apparently arise from limited oxygen supplies which dwindle more quickly as players take damage. It could be a neat mix alongside Bungie’s best-in-class gunplay feel, but a lot will come down to whether <em>Marathon</em>’s world building, gameplay, and player progression can match the intrigue and hype of its eye-catching art. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> last year that former <em>Marathon</em> director and long-time Bungie veteran Chris Barratt had been fired over creepy texts he sent female colleagues (he claims it was because Sony didn’t want to pay him massive stock bonuses and is currently suing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546">but the text messages speak for themselves</a></span>).

Incredibly accurate with no trajectory alterations, even over very long distances. Headshots are your friend, and they’ll help you rack up tons of KOs.</li><li><strong>Goddess of Death (Ultimate):</strong> Only usable in larger areas, this super causes Hela to grow large and take to the sky, throwing directed Nastrond crows that explode to cause heavy damage. The volley can be blocked by shields (including Dr. Strange’s shield, which he can fly up to block with) but deals tons of damage and gives Hela the perfect vantage point to pick off healers and vulnerable DPS characters.</li><li><strong>Piercing Night: </strong>A volley of five exploding daggers that move as projectiles. Much slower than Nightsword Thorns, the Piercing Night also explodes shortly after sticking in a target, dealing extra damage. They explode even if they hit the floor or other surfaces, but the explosion is small, so practice leading targets with this until you can reliably hit them.</li><li><strong>Soul Drainer:</strong> Throw an orb which stuns enemies in a small area, pulling them closer together. Great to use to set up allies for group knockouts.</li><li><strong>Astral Flock: </strong>Hela’s repositioning tool. Transform into a crow and fly in a straight line in the direction you are looking. Cannot be steered after she transforms, so be sure to aim carefully. Haphazard use of this skill will get you killed. It’s best used to fly to the top of buildings and other out:of:reach places to snipe enemies from.</li><li><strong>Nastrond Crowstorm (Passive):</strong> Defeated enemies spawn a crow which explodes shortly after the knockout.</li><li><strong>Hel’s Descent (Passive):</strong> Hold the jump button to fall through the air more slowly. Allows minor repositioning and works well in conjunction with an Astral Flock aimed upwards.</li><li><strong>Queen of Hel (Team-Up Ability): </strong>Teaming up with Thor and Loki unlocks Hela’s power over death, letting her instantly resurrect the Asgardian brothers when she delivers the final blow to an enemy while they are respawning. If they are still alive, they still benefit, getting Bonus Health.</li></ul><hr><p>With this info, you are fully prepared to become the Goddess of Death we always knew you were.

An internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed in offline mode on the Switch 2. Game-Key cards will also be marked by a white banner at the bottom of Switch 2 game cases, to differentiate them from Switch 2 cards that contain the full game on them.</p><div tabindex="0"

World</a> will be the first one to launch with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/">$80 price tag</a>. For many years, Nintendo still offered its first-party titles for $60--with rare exceptions like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom--and the company says it still looks at each game on a case-by-case basis when it comes to pricing.</p><p>Other games like Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">will also be $80 games</a>, and yes,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/" data-ref-id="1100-6530649"> Switch 2 physical cards will stay taste awful</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">Those prices could also increase further</a>, according to industry experts, as US president Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs have affected dozens of countries, including Vietnam, where a lot of Switch 2 hardware is being manufactured.</p><p>The impact of this has already been felt, as Nintendo announced last week that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 preorders in the US had been delayed</a> from their original start date of April 9 due to the tariffs.</p>

			<p>Exciting as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct was last week, even as it ended on a high note with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay-shows-how-its-more-than-just-a-dk-version-of-super-mario-odyssey/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, fans remained cautiously enthusiastic. We all recognized that Nintendo had left out the price of everything from the direct.</p>
<p>There was no price for the Nintendo Switch 2 or the games, which made even more sense when we found out, shortly after the direct was over, how expensive the Switch 2 was and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like Mario Kart World would be jumping up to $80 USD</a>.</p>
<p>But before we even get into how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">tariffs</a> could further change the pricing of the hardware and the games, Nintendo feels that Mario Kart World and every other Nintendo Switch 2 game that will cost $80 are worth that price point.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">IGN</a>, Nintendo of America vice president of product and player experience Bill Trinen discussed how Nintendo arrived at its new pricing structure and was adamant that Mario Kart World, the Nintendo Switch 2, and everything else that Nintendo reveals that now costs more are justified in that price.</p>
<p>"<em>I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, [...] I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out."</em></p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had."</em></p>
<p>Trinen's answer about the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom being $80, or the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Party Jamboree also being $80, followed the same line of thinking.</p>
<p>"<em>Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?'"</em></p>
<p>"<em>[...] I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that."</em></p>
<p>As a senior executive at Nintendo, Trinen is expected to defend the price hikes. Ultimately, everyone buying or not buying a Nintendo Switch 2 and any of the exclusive games for it will make that judgment for themselves.</p>
<p>And who knows, Trinen could end up being right in many players' eyes. We'll have to see how the upcoming Mario Kart World Direct fares with fans and if what's revealed there really showcases why it is worth the $80 price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-false-according-to-epic-games-boss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chief executive officer and head of Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-tim-sweeney-says-apple-and-google-run-gangster-style-businesses/">Tim Sweeney</a> has taken to X to shut down rumors about an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2-goes-live-bringing-back-tilted-towers/">Fortnite</a> movie.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/epic-games-boss-shuts-down-fortnite-movie-rumours-1525313/">GameReactor</a>, film insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK">DanielRPK</a> claimed that the idea of a Fortnite film had been floating around Hollywood but was unable to find a studio willing to take it on to start actually developing it. Which isn't all that surprising to hear if that was the case.</p>
<p>Fortnite is incredibly popular, but not for any narrative through-line. Epic has been able to keep going since its inception. Also, the inclusion of pretty much every character from the majority of the current popular intellectual properties across genres would make the film a logistical nightmare, should any proposed Fortnite film try to capture that aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the recent box office success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> had DanielRPK speculating that studios would change their tune. Minecraft has about the same amount of narrative to it that Fortnite does, and even though it's been critically panned, the power kids have over their parents' spending money remains undefeated.</p>
<p><span>Families continue to flock to the theater to see it, though a now-viral&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/ollie_twt/status/1908414804823543938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'chicken jockey'</a> moment suggests that those same parents ought to bring earplugs with them to the theater if they want to keep the use of their ears after they walk out. </span>Regardless, it doesn't seem like that's a rabbit hole worth jumping down, as Sweeney simply replied to DanielRPK's claims with the word <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632">"<em>false</em>."</a> DanielRPK later deleted his post.</p>
<p>Sweeney's dismissal of DanielRPK's claims does seem to end the conversation right there, but his one-word reply also leaves a bit of ambiguity as to what he's dismissing. Is he dismissing that a Fortnite movie was ever being shopped around? Is he dismissing that the movie was being reconsidered after the success of the Minecraft film? Is he dismissing all of DanielRPK's claims because a Fortnite movie is already in development and is entirely separate from DanielRPK's speculation?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps the simplest answer, he's just dismissing all of the above, and there is no Fortnite movie. Which, again, is not an unreasonable thing to suspect, because of how difficult it would be to navigate making that movie. Even in today's renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations (with a new box office record <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just broken</a> by A Minecraft Movie), there remain plenty of games that would simply not translate to the silver or small screen in a way that anyone would want. Including some of gaming's biggest franchises, like Fortnite.</p>
