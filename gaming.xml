			<p>The sports game that everyone has been waiting for is finally going into Early Access on PC on March 20, 2025. Wreckfest 2, a title that will have extreme full-contact racing and chaos, will be bigger and better than ever. The developers stated that the physics engine has been significantly overhauled so that the crashes are more intense than ever and deeper component damage. Of course, there will be the iconic mayhem of the races that everyone loves, but now it's even more detailed than before. This title was one of the most highly anticipated racing and sports games in<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/"> our 2025 round-up</a>.</p>
<p>For those who want to see what they can expect from Wreckfest 2's Early Access period, make sure to check out the trailer below to see some of the adrenaline rushes you can experience in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>High-speed circuits make a return, and you'll even get to race and crash through a junkyard, which can make for some intense collisions. More than that, you'll also get to try and attempt some serious jumps, which can help you get ahead of the opponent while weaving through oncoming traffic at busy intersections. Compared to other racing games, Wreckfest 2 is a game where no rules apply, and it's every driver for themselves. You will be racing against up to 23 other players or AI drivers, depending on what you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Instead of sparkly supercars to race through the tracks, the cars you choose will be patchwork jobs full of dents, rust, and broken parts to really add to the grime and grittiness of Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>Early Access will continue to progress and add new content, and during this time, you'll be able to build your very own car from the ground up and turn it into a force to be reckoned with. There will be new cars added to the game, as well as other vehicles to come in the future as the game continues to develop and evolve.</p>
<p>Consumer feedback is essential to the developers during the Early Access period and will all be taken on board so that it can be refined and reshaped as needed during Early Access.</p>
<p>For those on PC and want to get stuck into Wreckfest 2, make sure to wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> so you'll be notified when the game officially enters the Early Access period on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-execs-leaving<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlatinumGames founder and former CEO Hideki Kamiya has revealed that at least four more high-profile execs have quit the company, including the directors of hits like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p>

<p>In a recent video on his YouTube channel (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideki-kamiya-video-reveals-five-more-leads-have-quit-platinum-including-bayonetta-3s-director/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kamiya includes a photograph of himself and five other individuals, labeling the picture as a "former PlatinumGames directors' drinking party".</p>

<p>As well as Kamiya himself, the photo also includes Yusuke Miyata, Kenji Saito, and Takahisa Taura, the directors of <i>Bayonetta 3</i>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>, respectively. You can also spot&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta Origins</em>' Abebe Tinari, as well as character artist Masaki Yamanaka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=hhKATQvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=ygdronBD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several more folks appear to have left PlatinumGames.</figcaption></figure><p>As VGC points out, Tinari already revealed his departure from PlatinumGames last month, but to the best of my knowledge, the departure of the other four from PlatinumGames is new.</p>

<p>Kamiya doesn't state in the video whether any of the folks in the photo have joined his new studio Clovers or whether they'll be moving on to other ventures within the gaming industry, although at the very least, it seems plausible that&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>'s Taura is <a href="https://x.com/NSK29_0916/status/1869213824198599053" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting his own studio</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, these departures follow some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-quietly-removes-all-mentions-of-project-gg-from-website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rather odd changes</a> to PlatinumGames' website. A number of games, including titles like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>World of Demons</em>, and the previously-teased&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.</em>, have all been removed from the site's listings.</p>

<p>It seems the studio has removed games that are no longer available, which presumably also means&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the fact that they're completely gone from PlatinumGames' list feels a touch like revisionist history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-devastation-platinumgames.jpg?itok=U7B6A1Sy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-devastation-platinumgames.jpg?itok=FQKd5U6J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Delisted games like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation&nbsp;</em>have been removed from PlatinumGames' website.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Kamiya himself, after leaving PlatinumGames <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-explains-why-he-quit-platinumgames" rel="nofollow">back in 2023</a>, he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">currently working on a sequel to&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">Okami</a>&nbsp;</em>with his new studio Clovers, which also has several ex-PlatinumGames staffers working for it.</p>

<p>The sequel is likely some way away from being released, but it's nice to know that Kamiya is getting to work on a project in which he'd <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-would-like-to-make-new-viewtiful-joe-and-okami-games-comments-on" rel="nofollow">previously expressed interest</a>. Maybe now we can hope for that new&nbsp;<em>Viewtiful Joe&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>alongside Team Ninja. The game was revealed during last month's Xbox Developer Direct and is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012110" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ninja-gaiden-4/9p0sq1s72g4j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been having a great time with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a><em>. </em>I do my dailies, grind for materials, and desperately search for an outfit that works with the single ugliest piece of clothing in the game: a red vest. But as I’ve progressed, the game has given me — a gacha newbie — an unfortunate crash-course education on how these games really work and what not to do if you want to keep your sanity and your wallet intact.</p><p>The trouble began right before the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year event</a>, when I started obtaining every piece of a special outfit called Wings of Wishes. In <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, special outfits like Wings of Wishes are gated behind what’s called Resonance Events, which are essentially slot machines available for a limited time. When you spend currency in the game, you’re not buying outfits outright; you’re paying to “pull” the lever on that slot machine in hopes that it’ll spit out the pieces you want. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>This is the best I can do styling this hideous red vest. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>Throughout the month Wings of Wishes was available, I managed to earn eight of its nine pieces, even though I wasn’t really trying to get it. And as the event wound down, I was confident that even if I ran out of currency, I’d simply earn enough back for the final piece. But once I exhausted all the story and event quests, I learned that the game does not reward currency at a pace that can keep up with even casual, intermittent pulling. I went from earning enough to pull 10 or 20 times a week down to four or five times. It was like that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/when-you-get-paid-biweekly">paycheck meme</a>, where, in the first week after you get paid, you’re eating steak and caviar for dinner, but by the second, you’re having ice soup. It got so dire that, by the end of the event, I started spending money hoping I’d pull the last piece, but I never did. </p><p>I was crushed, not only for obvious reasons but also because playing this game wasn’t supposed to change my spending habits. And I learned through consulting with my gacha veteran friends and the <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subreddit that I made the rookiest of mistakes in thinking I could outsmart a game engineered to part me from my money in ways I wouldn’t really notice or feel. </p><p>Gacha games have a poor reputation because of the way they can exploit players to extract their money. I got got because I thought I was above that, not realizing the game had already tapped into my FOMO and my wallet. Nothing, not even Wings of Wishes, was ever so desirable that it was worth focusing on. It only became a focus when I realized I needed <em>one more piece</em> right before the event ended. On top of that, I never noticed my spending. I wasn’t concerned because I wasn’t dropping $30–$50, but I was spending two dollars, three dollars, 99 cents, two and three times a day, because again, all I needed was <em>one more piece</em>. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>I spent so much money I didn’t intend trying to complete this Wings of Wishes outfit that I don’t even like!</em></figcaption></p></div><p>True blue gacha veterans will tell you that if there’s something you want, be prepared to either pay for it or plan for it. Players who don’t want to spend money for outfits skip two and three events in a row, hoarding their currency, waiting for the right outfit to spend their entire warchest on all for free. On the other hand, if a player wants to pay for an outfit, they know to be prepared to spend bill money for it. Pulling is the same as working a slot machine: you’re not guaranteed to hit. But <em>Infinity Nikki</em> guarantees a high-value piece every 10 pulls. With the currency used for pulls going for a dollar apiece, a nine-piece outfit like Wings of Wishes will run you at least $90. That amount goes up dramatically because the guarantee is for <em>any</em> high-value piece, and Resonance Events often contain <em>multiple</em> high-value outfits that have anywhere between eight and 10 pieces.</p><p>I understand that my problems likely don’t extend to the majority of other players. From perusing the game’s subreddit, I get the feeling most people either already understand the level of preparation required to obtain coveted clothing effectively, don’t mind spending eye-watering sums, or are content to either engage with the system casually or ignore it altogether. I planned on being the latter, someone who tossed the developers a few bucks here and there to obtain the occasional outfit I fancied.</p><div id=":R52rarr6:"><p><figcaption><em>Anyway, these are much better outfits.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And in my naivete, I assumed that’s how gacha games worked. You could either grind out the resources you needed or spend money only when you chose to for items you wanted. Yes, I understood there were elements of random chance to compete against, but I genuinely thought that I could guarantee myself the desired outfits through a mix of casual play and light spending. I will not make that mistake again. Thankfully, the current Lunar New Year event doesn’t have any premium outfits I want. Plus, the ones being given away for free are more than cute enough to soothe my sartorial spirit. </p><p>The real tragedy of all this is that I don’t even like how Wings of Wishes looks. I only wanted it for its special ability to make Nikki’s floating animation look like she’s gliding on a magical paper crane. I have multiple substitutes for the white stockings I’m missing, so I can easily complete the look. But without that final piece, the outfit’s ability won’t trigger, and I don’t like it enough to wear it casually. So it’ll sit, incomplete and unworn, in my wardrobe, possibly forever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Warhorse's medieval muck-o-rama <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> launches today. It's an engrossing RPG, despite its co-founder Dan Vávra's tendency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gamergator-rhetoric-of-historical-accuracy-has-come-back-to-bite-kingdom-come-on-the-arse">throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-performance-best-settings">a relatively bug-free one</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In the course of my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">51 hours as reviewer</a>, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
My game started to crash frequently following a larger patch before the review embargo, about halfway through my playthrough. The simulation would lock up in the menus, when using the photo mode, and sometimes during exploration. After some trial and error, I deduced that this had to do with my controller cable connection being a little loose. KCD2 does not, in my experience, like it when you appear to be switching rapidly between mouse-and-keyboard and a controller. After switching to a new cable, I was able to make headway without much further trouble.
</p>
<p>
The bug cost me hours of progress not because it wiped or corrupted saves, but because it formed a devil's partnership with Deliverance 2's interestingly fussy, hydra-headed approach to saving. As in the first game, you can checkpoint your progress by drinking an in-game alcoholic beverage, Saviour Schnapps. As Brendy observed to me during edits, it's a fun bit of Ye Olde Meta Commentary that openly positions quicksaving as a vice. 
</p><p>
It's not quite as inconvenient as it sounds: I stumbled on fresh batches of Saviour Schnapps regularly during quests, and you can always brew it yourself from nettles, which grow all over the place, and belladonna, which is found in forest clearings. What's more, apothecaries like the one in Trosky village buy the stuff for decent money, so you can turn a quick profit while stocking up. A single dose of Saviour Schnapps will render you merry (with associated stat buffs) but not absolutely plimsolled, so it shouldn't interfere with your exploits providing you're not the kind to hit F5 at the slightest whiff of peril. 
</p>
<p>
The trouble with Saviour Schnapps is simply that Warhorse try to have their cake and eat it. If the idea is to teach you to weigh the prospect of failure properly, by making quicksaving more of a ritual, this is undercut by the fact that the game <em>does</em> checkpoint after certain quest milestones. As such, it's easy to forget the need to toss back a schnapps now and then. Stir that inconsistency together with a persistent crashing problem, and you have a spicy cocktail I like to call The 11pm Shrieker.
</p>
<p>
Again, this is the only genuinely severe technical problem I've discovered in KCD2. The issue with loose controller connections may have been patched out by the time I read this. Still, you might want to check your USB ports, just in case.

            <title><![CDATA[CS2 Match Decided By Coin Flip After Both Teams Forfeit]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-match-decided-by-coin-flip-after-both-teams-forfeit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Both teams chose to forfeit in the middle of a professional Counter-Strike 2 match, letting the final map and the series itself be determined by a simple coin flip. Why? Because another qualifier scheduled for today has much higher stakes in the Valve Regional Standings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ez-win">‘ez win’</h2>



<p>Earlier today, Ninjas in Pyjamas and Aurora faced off in a best-of-three as part of the CCT Season 2 Europe Series 18 Closed Qualifier. However, both CS2 teams wanted to compete in the BLAST Rising Europe open qualifiers later on, meaning the match would have to end after two maps for both teams to have time. Unfortunately for both NiP and Aurora, they split the first two maps, and with their BLAST Rising qualifier matches starting soon, both teams chose to forfeit.</p>



<p>Following the third map, caster Charlie “Cmd64” Drudge explained that <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378992/aurora-vs-ninjas-in-pyjamas-cct-season-2-europe-series-18-closed-qualifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aurora had forfeited</a> the map due to scheduling. However, the official NiP account on X stated that both teams had actually forfeited, but NiP had won the coin toss.</p>







<p>The decision to skip the rest of the CCT match in favor of the BLAST Rising qualifier actually panned out for NiP. The Ninjas won the Nordic Open Qualifier, earning a guaranteed spot in the closed qualifier that begins tomorrow. Unfortunately for Aurora, they didn’t just lose the coin toss, as they were eliminated in the semifinal of their BLAST Rising open qualifier.</p>



<p>Both teams consider the risk worth the reward. The closed qualifiers for BLAST Rising are events ranked by the Valve Regional Standings, and making it past qualifiers would be very rewarding to a team’s ranking. Format is the big difference maker. The CCT closed qualifier is also ranked, but it uses a group stage format, so one loss won’t immediately eliminate a team like Aurora. However the BLAST Rising open qualifier is a single-elimination bracket, so missing your match would result in instant elimination.</p>

Trench warfare could be very useful in Helldivers 2's battles, assuming the player isn't killed while digging.</p><p>However, it doesn't appear that digging is an option everywhere. Players will get a POI notice if they can use the shovel. For now, players are still experimenting to learn the extent of what they can do with the shovels, including how deep they can dig and if they can create a network of trenches by working together.</p><p>Additionally, Arrowhead has announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/505067472486927858" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the next Helldivers 2 Warbond</a> is coming on February 6. Servants of Freedom will include a portable Hellbomb that can be strapped to the back of players. The Sickle is also getting an upgrade with the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle, while the GP-20 Ultimatum may be the most powerful grenade launcher that the game has seen to date.

                <p>Unlike other games, it's difficult to put an exact timeframe on just how long it takes to beat a playthrough of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization VII</a>. For starters, the first couple of hours when you begin can be so daunting from a gameplay perspective, so you might spend more time reading the encyclopedia than actually playing. Another huge factor is the various difficulty settings you can apply to your playthrough, which can drastically alter the overall time it takes to get through all three ages in Civ 7.</p><p>Still, we know you have questions about the game's length and we're to give you the best answer we can. So just how long does it take to beat Civ 7?</p><h2>How long it takes to beat Civilization 7</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437801" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437801"></a><figcaption>An end-of-game scene in Civilization VII</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png"></figure><p>The best way to measure how long a playthrough of Civ 7 takes is by counting the number of turns you do across all three ages. While this isn't a full representation of the overall game length, it does provide you with the best tool to measure your progress. And, speaking from experience, I can offer rough time estimates for the amount of turns it takes to beat a playthrough.</p><p>The number of turns it takes to get through all three ages in Civ 7 is entirely dependent on the "Game Speed" you play at. Playing on the fastest speed means it takes fewer turns to complete every age while the slowest speed takes the most turns possible. There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-difficulty-options-and-how-to-change-the-difficulty/1100-6528923/" data-ref-id="1100-6528923">four main game speeds in Civ 7</a> and, from fastest to slowest, they are Quick, Standard, Epic, and Marathon. There's also an "Online" option but that's only for multiplayer.</p><p>If you decide to play on the Standard game speed, every age takes roughly 120-160 turns to complete. The Antiquity Age, which is where the game starts, usually takes the most numbers of turns, as you'll receive more leeway to start up your settlement and get units produced. However, as you move on to the subsequent Exploration and Modern Ages, it takes fewer turns to reach the end of the age. My Antiquity Age on Standard speed took 160 turns while the Exploration Age took 150 and the Modern Age took 120. Of course, your results will vary depending on what kind of path you take.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437800" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437800"></a><figcaption>The Antiquity Age will likely take you the most turns to complete</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png"></figure><p>Overall, <strong>a Standard speed playthrough of Civ 7 took me close to 35 hours to complete</strong>. This included a decent amount of encyclopedia reading and strategy when it came to individual turns, so I didn't speed through the game by any means. However, I also didn't spend minutes upon minutes agonizing over what to build or what leader to target.</p><p>On the flip side, you can expect a Quick speed playthrough to take significantly less time than a Standard speed run. <strong>My first Quick playthrough only lasted around 15 hours</strong>, with each age taking close to five hours and around 100 turns.</p><p>If you want to truly go the distance in Civ 7, playing on either Epic or Marathon speed takes dozens of hours and hundreds of turns per age. I didn't get to finish a playthrough on either speed, but the Antiquity Age ended at 300 turns on Epic and over 400 turns on Marathon. <strong>In all likelihood, you could spend over 100 hours on a single Epic or Marathon run</strong>, especially if you crank the difficulty level up and play on a large map.</p><p>Speaking of which, the map size and difficulty level also play a factor in determining how many turns and hours your playthrough takes. If you play on the smallest map size and the easiest difficulty, you can breeze through a run in 10-20 hours. However, turning everything to the max amplifies how much time you spend in Civ 7 by a significant amount.</p><p>There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.

            <p>
UK game maker Sumo Digital has told staff it will refocus exclusively on "development services for partners", rather than continuing to create its own IP.
</p>
<p>
This decision will "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people," a <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">statement</a> from the company noted today. 
</p>
<p>
"We are committed to minimising this impact as much as possible, exploring all options to retain talent, and supporting those affected with transparency, care and compassion," it added.

<p>
Headquarted in Sheffield, Sumo Digital has grown considerably since its founding in 2003, with development offices in Nottingham, Newcastle, Leamington Spa and Warrington, and also abroad in India. 
</p>
<p>
The company additionally owns several other studios, including the Brighton-based The Chinese Room, developer of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a>.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> announced it had bought parent company Sumo Group in a deal worth around £919m. 
</p>
<p>
Today's news seems set to mark the second round of layoffs at the company in under a year, after 15 percent of its staff were let go in June 2024, and Canadian indie studio Timbre Games was divested. 
</p>
<p>
Sumo Digital has long been a work-for-hire studio that has quietly helped develop some of video gaming's biggest blockbusters, with contributions to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s recent Hitman trilogy, Xbox's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> and 5, Activison's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-vanguard">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a> and Warner Bros' Hogwarts Legacy. 
</p>
<p>
It has also worked on a long list of games as lead developer, including Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing, and LittleBigPlanet 3 and Sackboy: A Big Adventure for PlayStation.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Sumo had begun working on its own IP, including puzzle platformer Snake Pass, and indie titles such as DeathSprint 66 and Critter Cafe that it released through its own publishing label, Secret Mode.
</p>
<p>
Sumo's statement says the company has now been forced to balance "creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business". 
</p>
<p>
The company continued by saying it hoped the decision would strengthen its position as "a premium development partner" going forwards. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether collaborating on new or established games, co-developing games, providing specialist engineering, or porting services; we are confident in our teams' exceptional talent and our ability to thrive in this next chapter," the company concluded.

Often “soulslike” is meant to call attention to the mechanical similarities between whatever game and <em>Dark Souls</em>—the game may have limited checkpoints, a resource you gain from bosses that is lost upon death, or particularly challenging combat. Rarely do games like that scratch my <em>Dark Souls</em> itch, because what attracts me to those games is not the broad mechanical designations, but the more idiosyncratic design choices paired with a stark, impressionistic approach to storytelling.</p><p><em>Death Howl</em> did actually evoke <em>Dark Souls</em> for me. As a self described “soulslike deckbuilder,” it hits those mechanical signposts—it has bonfires that respawn combat encounters, and you can use the “howls” you earn from enemies to craft more cards—and is atmospheric in a way I long for when I play any game.</p><p>You play as Ro, a mother who has lost her son and is trying to find his soul before he fully departs to the land of the dead. While the demo only shows off one portion of the map, it’s fairly generous. Using a limited color palette and simple but evocative pixel sprites, the game lures you into a richly imagined world inspired by Scandinavian folklore. <em>Death Howl</em> does a lot with a little—sparse but ominous music and the deep red tones that the game is rendered in do a lot of work to evoke a feeling of death and decay. The economy of art and dialogue gave me that <em>Dark Souls</em> feeling of being trapped, out of my depth, in a dying world. Occasionally it even scared the shit out of me. Stumbling upon this part of the map briefly made my heart pound with fear—in motion, the leaves of the trees quiver uncannily, as if they too are watching you trespass into death’s realm.</p><figure></figure><p>As a deckbuilder, the other “soulslike” trademarks are also translated in new ways. As Ro explores the map, she finds grids on the ground where enemies are. As soon as she steps onto the grid, it triggers a turn-based combat encounter. Ro fights these enemies by drawing cards from a deck, representing her attacks. As much as this reminds me of other deck builders like <em>Slay The Spire</em>, there are <em>Souls</em>-esque idiosyncrasies that make it stand apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the way you can’t cancel a combat animation once you press a button in <em>Dark Souls</em>, once you play a card or move Ro on the board in <em>Death Howl</em> you cannot undo it. You have to commit to the decision you made, even if you understand your mistake as soon as you’ve made it. Instead of asking me to play in a way that is mechanically similar to <em>Dark Souls</em>, I feel like I’m playing a game that requires me to think in the same way that I do when I play <em>Dark Souls</em>. Is this the right time for this attack? Do I really want to stand here? Do I have enough health to make the run back between this bonfire and the boss I want to beat? The entirety of the game becomes a puzzle.</p><p><em>Death Howl</em> is available to wishlist on Steam and has a demo. I think I’ll be returning to that demo again—at least until another game comes out that really scratches my <em>Dark Souls</em> itch.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea"><h3>BioWare Is In Big Trouble</h3></a><p>"A lot was riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NEOWIZ and Wolfeye Studios have partnered up to bring players a brand new Retro Sci-fi First-Person Action RPG. NEOWIZ will be responsible for publishing this title and supporting Wolfeye Studios through the development process. So far, the game has yet to be named, but what we do know is that the game will be set in a retrofuturistic setting with a branching narrative, with the game then going on to be distributed globally by NEOWIZ when the time comes.</p>
<p>As a celebration of the partnership news, Wolfeye Studios has released some of their concept art for the upcoming title. There are three images to showcase the world that players will get to explore, from dusty desert towns to built-up elegant interiors. The images chosen are being used to show how diverse the world will be, combining rugged environments with futuristic style to create a unique experience for the audience.</p>

<p>The team leaders of Wolfeye Studios are Raf Colantonio and Julien Roby, who have worked on Dishonored and Prey. They are also joined by industry veterans who worked with them on those two titles, as well as some of the developers working on Dark Messiah, Pentiment, and Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Wolfeye Studios is now working hard to create this RPG title, with it set to be released on PC and console. <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The team</a> at Wolfeye Studios works from more than 10 different cities around the world, working across seven different time zones on four different continents. In 2022, Wolfeye Studios released its first game, "Weird West," which went on to be nominated for BEST RPG of the Year at the annual D.I.C.E. Awards.</p>
<p>"We have a burning passion for making a very specific type of game that blends RPG, action and simulation. These games can only be successful when the publisher shares that same passion," says Raf Colantonio, Creative Director and President of Wolfeye Studios.</p>
<p>NEOWIZ has helped publish some very well-known titles over the years, with the most recent being the award-winning title <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">Lies of P</a>. Lies of P is set to get a DLC sometime this year. This company has most recently announced a partnership with ZAKAZANE, a studio that consists of CD Projekt Red and 11 Bit Studios alumni.</p>
<p>While the details about the developer's upcoming title are slim, you can check out the concept art above for a glimpse into what you can expect in the future.</p>

When players loaded <em>Helldivers 2</em> up post-update, however, they started to discover these shovels during their latest galactic war expeditions.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is an enormous game in both scope and scale and from the maps you explore to the missions you complete, you’ll need to invest <strong>many hours </strong>in the game to conquer everything. That’s all well and good saying that, but what do the numbers look like? How long is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll introduce you to the size of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, breaking down just how long KCD2 is and how many hours it’ll take you to finish it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How Many Hours is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>It took me 65.5 hours to complete the main story and a lot of side content in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</strong>.</p>



<p>That includes many restarts and reloads following deaths and failed objectives. In those 65.5 hours, I managed to get to level 22, acquired some of the best weapons and armour in the game, and unlocked 50% of all the game’s achievements.</p>



<p>I <strong>didn’t </strong>unlock the achievement to ‘finish most of the game’s content’. </p>



<p>I also know that in those 65.5 hours, I left a lot of side missions untouched in my eagerness to get the game finished for a full review. However, you can go back and finish up skipped content once you’ve completed the game, so that’s my goal.</p>



<p>I believe that I left behind (or didn’t discover) enough content to push Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to around<strong> 100 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>From mastering skills to uncovering secrets and from taking part in side activities to conquering secondary and tertiary quests, there is still so much for me to finish. I haven’t unfogged the entire map, I’ve not knocked all the nests out of the trees, and I haven’t visited every point of interest marked on my map.</p>



<p>If I speak frankly, I’d say that <strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is around 100 hours long </strong>for the average player. If you’re just rushing the story and not participating in side missions, you can probably complete the whole thing in around <strong>20 – 30 hours</strong> without making any mistakes.</p>

			<p>During our recent trip to Oslo to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play Funcom's Dune Awakening</a> game, the developer also organized a roundtable Q&amp;A where the press could ask a few questions directly to Game Director Joel Bylos. You can find the full transcript of the conversation on the game's features and mechanics below. As a reminder, Dune Awakening is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated for a Q1 launch on PC</a> (where it will support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> on day one) and later on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p><strong>From what I've seen, the PVP seems mostly going to be world PVP. But is there going to be any kind of game mode where you are instanced for some kind of ranked mode where you can compete and maybe rank up?</strong></p>
<p>No, the plan is to keep it to world PvP.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned before having the limitation of portraying the Fremen in the game. Were there any other instances of things that you could or could not do because of the movies? How did that impact your take on the game?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, sure, plenty of things. For example, they're working on the third movie now and I thought, oh, they're gonna be loosened up a little after the second movie's out and it has been such a huge success that they're not gonna be as worried about what we're portraying in Dune Awakening.</p>
<p>And then they announced the third movie and they came to us and said, oh, by the way, all these things from the second book, you can't use them. And I'm like, guys, the game is half built around those things already because we've been working on it for X years and then we had a long conversation and it's kind of okay. But there were things that, yeah, they didn't want us to show.</p>
<p>I don't want to go into too many specifics because it kind of spoils the game and the third movie. But there are things that, because I knew we couldn't rely on the first book, I took a lot of the stuff from the second book and put it in the game because I was like, well, the first book, I know they're making two movies out of that one, and I didn't know they were going to make a third movie.</p>
<p>About eight months ago, I found out they were doing that, and I had a conversation with Legendary. They're great partners to work with. I've heard horror stories about working with, say, Star Wars, and it's nothing like that. These guys are great at sharing with us, they're great at keeping us in the loop. But they also want to make sure that when Denis does his vision for certain things in the world, we haven't already put out something that sort of would change that or conflict with that. I can give an example, a very specific one: the trailer we saw with the old history.</p>
<p>Originally, that trailer showed Paul in the future, sitting on his throne, talking about the past, talking about this other universe he sees, but they were very clear that he can't be sitting on a throne. We can't imply that Paul is in any way a king or an emperor. So, we changed it to him standing up in front of a stone mural, and that was because, which is kind of flattering, they said, look, the visuals for this are so nice, it could be something that Denis did, and we don't want people to make that mistake.</p>
<p>We were like, okay. They were worried that it might actually be taken as a trailer for the third movie or something, so that's actually a bit flattering, but it's also a restriction that comes back to us. In general, it's been great to work with them. We got to go to Budapest and walk around the sets of the films and things like that, so we've been very involved with working tightly with them.</p>
<p>But yeah, there's always constraints and like I said, I think that actually drives us to more creativity. It forces us to think around corners, and I think that it puts us in a place to make the game super interesting for people who already know the story of Dune and want to see what this alternate take looks like.</p>
<p><strong>When creating Dune Awakening, which existing games do you see it appealing the most?</strong></p>
<p>It's a tough one. I'll just say survival games first and foremost, I think there's a huge number of people who play survival games. I think we've seen massive successes in that space. We made Conan Exiles, so we know that crowd.</p>
<p>Also, anybody who likes to play with their friends and muck around a bit, I think it's a pretty good experience for that. And just people who are into detailed, interesting worlds, and of course, that includes people who are into Dune, but also kind of just people who like to play around in a nice cool open world and see what's there.</p>
<p><strong>The example of the gameplay given here today obviously is to show off the combat in one of the dungeons of Dune Awakening. Going a little bit further with that, obviously players want to feel rewarded for the content that they do. In the instance of doing a dungeon, for example, how is the looting in that case? Is it like, throughout the dungeon, you pick stuff up on the side, or is there just one main end goal at the end of it?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the stylization of the progression of the location, it is mostly towards the end, but there can be tidbits throughout the way. We have to see exactly how players respond to how we're distributing rewards. Right now, we have a reward for everybody - as long as you get to the end boss, everyone gets a version of the reward. We're going to see how that works for the economy to see if we need to adjust anything there, but that's the current approach. There are other things along the way, but by grouping together, you will not be penalised for playing with your friends.</p>
<p>There are types of resources that only exist in ecology labs. There are types of resources that only exist in fallen shipwrecks. In particular, it's tied to the type of item it is. Vehicles and vehicle parts can only be mostly found in ecology labs, and suspenser tech and Holtzman shield technology can only be found in these ecology labs where it's been locked away for 10,000 years.</p>
<p>Things like modern weapons and armors, a lot of those are locked away in shipwrecks that have fallen, so you need to go to those locations to get those components. We have an instanced looting system, which means that everybody gets their own version of what the chest has, so everyone rolls on the chest and gets their own thing. There's no loot stealing from other people in a sense. But all the dungeons are open, so it is quite possible for you to come across a dungeon where someone's just run it and there's no enemy inside because they've just killed them all for you. You run in and get your own loot. It's your lucky day, you've got a jackpot and you didn't have to do much work. But it's spread out enough that that doesn't happen that often.</p>
<p>Finally, the other thing I was going to mention is we have a unique schematic system in Dune Awakening, which I think is maybe somewhat interesting for people who play survival games. In the technology tree, you unlock schematics that you can craft infinitely, but in the world, you find unique schematics that you can only craft one or two or three of, and this is what drives our economic system in the game. You might find a special type of Lasgun, and you can only craft one of them. You'd have to run that dungeon many times to get more of that particular gun. Also, they can be repaired a certain number of times before the durability goes to zero, and then you will be like, I need to go back and run that dungeon because I really like that gun or that armour.</p>
<p>In the deep desert, because we're wiping it every week, you can have stuff like a really cool gun that only shows up once every six months. Maybe your guild wants to get as many of those schematics in that week as possible, so you're the only people on the server who can craft that gun. It's a real driver of this rarity and uniqueness of items. That's the loot philosophy in the game right now.</p>

<p><strong>WCCFTECH: I was curious if there are any plans to enable privately hosted servers for the roleplaying communities in Dune Awakening.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, so it's an ongoing discussion. We have the ability to do it. What we don't want to do is release our server code to people because it's slightly different than how it's been in the past.</p>
<p>There's a discussion going on about whether we can host servers for people, kind of like Fallout 76 allows people to host, they pay Bethesda but they get their server. We're thinking about how to do this in the best possible way. We haven't made any clear decisions on it yet because it's a complicated thing, especially because the game is made of multiple maps, and one server is usually one map. Essentially, you'd be renting four maps, because you'd have to rent the main map and then all of the social hubs, and then the deep desert is nine maps using <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">server meshing</a>.</p>
<p>They're all tied together, so it becomes very complicated. In order to rent a private world, you would have to pay the cost of 15 servers, and that is not something we want to put on players, so then we need to figure out the best configuration. Maybe people just want to rent the main map and that's fine, and then we can allow people to do things like speed up progression and change variables on that map, but that's why it's complicated. We're still under discussion. I don't know if we'll have it sorted out for launch, but it's definitely not off the table, and it's something we're discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Are there trade auction houses, that sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p>We have a place called the Exchange in the major cities. You can go there and put things on the Exchange for sale, buy and sell orders, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>In terms of player trade, when you meet a player in the world, you can just click on them, choose trade, and exchange items with each other. You can also do the classic survival thing and just dump it on the ground and someone can pick it up. But I'm not sure we have the permission set up so that you could pick up someone else's loot bag.</p>
<p>Follow-up question about PVP. If there's not gonna be any instanced PvP, but will it be possible to duel someone, to challenge someone to a one-on-one duel? In the movies, we saw some of this.</p>
<p>I want to do that in the future, but it's not gonna be there for launch. I'm sorry about that, but yeah, I just couldn't fit it in the time scale for the game.</p>
<p><strong>When you die in Dune Awakening, how much do you lose of what you collected?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not gonna dare to try and remember the percentages, but you don't drop any of your items, you lose resources. If you're carrying scrap metal, stone, spice, I think you drop all of your spice, 100% of whatever spice you're carrying, 100% of the coins you're carrying, the money you're carrying, but there's a banking system so you can bank money to avoid losing it. And then I think it's 30%ish of the resources you're carrying that are lost upon death. Of course, you can run back to pick it up from your corpse. People cannot loot your corpse in PvE areas of the game, but there are PvP areas of the game where they can.</p>
<p><strong>I really like the ability customization that you guys have. I was kind of wondering, is there a possibility to save builds of abilities so somebody can hotkey to them really quickly to switch?</strong></p>
<p>No. That's a great quality of life suggestion that we should have. We need to figure out how we handle cooldowns and swapping out abilities when they're on cooldown and off cooldown. Yes, we want it. We need to figure out the best way to do it. But yeah, it's definitely one of those quality of life things we'd like to have.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101%E2%80%99s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath.1099788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/">Wired Productions</a> will be collaborating with Camel 101 once again to publish their upcoming Lovecraftian horror FPS Beneath. This game draws inspiration from F.E.A.R and Resident Evil and will see players head into the darkest of the depths as a deep-sea diver. While there, you'll have to fight off eldritch horrors that are lurking below. For those who are interested in Beneath, a<a href="https://mailchi.mp/wiredproductions/omniumtrials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> closed beta playtest</a> is currently available for sign-up, where you may get the chance to explore the game early and help the developers by providing feedback.</p>
<p>Below is the trailer for Beneath, where you can see what to expect from the upcoming title developed by Camel 101, the minds behind Those Who Remain and Syndrome.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beneath | Publishing Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSa-rGiKdh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a seasoned deep-sea diver named Noah Quinn, and you end up on an expedition that begins to go incredibly wrong, causing you to end up trapped in the depths of the ocean. There, you'll begin to uncover the ancient evil that lurks in the waters, and you'll have to start confronting them yourself if you want to have any chance of survival.</p>
<p>Much like titles like Resident Evil and Half-Life, the ammo you have access to is limited, meaning you have to make do with the scarce amount of supplies you have. All the while, you have to maintain your sanity levels in the depths to avoid being overwhelmed by the eldritch horrors. There are more than just eldritch atrocities to deal with, as you'll also have to fight off soldiers. In Beneath, you aren't confined to just your rig, as you will also be able to utilize your deep-sea dive suit and navigate the ocean.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to work with Bruno and Ricardo again," said Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions. "They are a passionate and talented team, and as brothers, their bond resonates deeply with Wired. Long-term relationships are important to us and we will put our hearts and souls into Beneath and them."</p>
<p>Thus far, it's been confirmed that Beneath will be coming to PC. It has not been stated as of yet whether this game will be available on other platforms in the future.</p>
<p>"We couldn't be more excited about teaming up with Wired! Our previous partnership on Those Who Remain was a success, so we already know the value they bring to the table. Beneath is our most ambitious project to date, and we're sure that their passion and expertise will be invaluable in helping us bring the game to its full potential," said Ricardo Cesteiro, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Camel 101.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckfest 2 Early Access Release Date Scheduled for March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-scheduled-for-march.1099785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and Bugbear have announced the Early Access release date for destruction derby racer&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>, so get ready to engage in what the two studios describe as "absolute vehicular mayhem".</p>

<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on March 20th. The game will also eventually come to consoles, although it doesn't look like the Early Access release is making it onto PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, sadly.</p>

<p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>will pack in three gameplay modes: Racing, Derby, and Multiplayer. They're fairly self-explanatory, and as Early Access progresses, Bugbear says it'll also add "a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=Fej_bZWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=v8MCyrFL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>promises glorious destruction derby action in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the career mode, Bugbear is also promising to add new tracks and vehicles throughout&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>'s Early Access development, and new special challenges in which you race vehicles that "were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack" will be introduced.</p>

<p>Various other features, like tournaments and mod support, are also on the cards for Early Access. Rest assured that it does sound like&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>has a solid core in place if you do decide to pick it up before these features have been implemented, though.</p>

<p>That experience involves what Bugbear and THQ Nordic describe as "full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw-dropping moments of chaos and destruction". The sequel will sport an improved physics engine compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wreckfest" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, too.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what kind of destructive action to expect from the game.</p>




<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on March 20th. There's no word yet on when the game is coming to consoles, although it has been slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-to-bring-portable-hellbomb-and-more.1099782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and if you've ever wanted the destructive power of a Hellbomb strapped to your back, this is the Warbond for you.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, Servants of Freedom brings a bunch of new gear for you to try out, foremost among which is the B-100 Portable Hellbomb Stratagem. Like the regular Hellbomb, make sure you're nowhere near this one when it goes off.</p>

<p>Of course, new weapons are also coming as part of this Warbond, including the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle, which powers up the regular Sickle and allows it to overheat, potentially damaging both you and "everything in its path".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=dpfGsSCh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=y7p1VvWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you your very own portable Hellbomb.</figcaption></figure><p>The secondary slot, meanwhile, gets a new GP-20 Ultimatum grenade pistol, which is "designed for closer-range use". That, given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s penchant for randomly murdering you in hilarious ways, sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.</p>

<p>Servants of Freedom also brings a new throwable weapon in the G-50 Seeker, a drone that follows along behind you and explodes near enemies when it detects them. It can also target enemies you ping.</p>

<p>Two new armor sets have been added, both medium sets: the IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous. Both sets come complete with rather terrifying masked helms that will make you look like Doctor Doom, but if he fought on the side of justice, truth, and democracy (ahem).</p>

<p>Naturally, the Warbond comes complete with new capes, a new player title, and a new cheer as well, all of which should help you express yourself when you're taking the fight to those dastardly Terminids (or bots, or Illuminate, of course).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt announced last week that he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">intending to take a sabbatical from work</a>, and that when he returns, he'll begin work on a new Arrowhead game. Exciting!</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and the Servants of Freedom Warbond arrives on February 6th. You can check out our&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">review here</a>.</p>
