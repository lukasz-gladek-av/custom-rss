Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are standing on a hill with the Jackson settlement they’ll call home in the distance. Ellie, unconvinced by Joel’s story about raiders massacring the Firefly revolutionaries who were looking to make a cure for the cordyceps fungus, asks the smuggler to swear that everything he said is true. Joel hesitates and then says that he swears. However, rather than keeping the now-iconic hard cut to black on Ellie’s skeptical face as she says “okay,” season two shows her walking down the hill and leaving Joel in an uncomfortable silence. This unnecessary addition to a scene that was once perfect is a pretty concise encapsulation of the season’s biggest problems. But it’s hardly the most egregious example in this episode.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h642553"><a id=""></a><strong>Unfamiliar faces</strong></h2><p>The first “new” scene shows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a></span> standing with her friends and fellow ex-Fireflies over a few dozen makeshift graves. She tearfully watches the same giraffe pack that Joel and Ellie stood in awe of days prior, grazing through the remains of Salt Lake City. HBO hasn’t played coy with Abby’s role in the season like Naughty Dog did ahead of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, but I was surprised at how quickly the show just tells you up front about her intentions.</p><p>As Owen (Spencer Lord), Mel (Ariela Barer), Nora (Tati Gabrielle), and Manny (Danny Ramirez) all discuss what their next steps are, prioritizing their safety and survival above all else, Abby has other ideas. She wants to find Joel, and she wants to kill him “slowly” for what he’s done to the Fireflies. She puts a pendant around one of the crosses, implying some personal connection to one of Joel’s victims, before we cut to black. Already, <em>The Last of Us </em>struggles to elegantly add to <em>Part II</em>, seemingly in a misguided effort to add clarity to a story that has, historically, lent itself to several different interpretations. Withholding those reveals until later in the story was not just a narrative trick in <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>that allowed it to twist the knife mid-game; it also helped generate a core tension foundational to the story being told. Two scenes in, <em>The Last of Us </em>is stripping away the tantalizing and uncomfortable mystique of the original story, but it doesn’t have anything to offer in its place. Dever commits to Abby’s rage and delivers the lines with conviction, and her friends’ hesitant compliance comes across well enough. There’s just a strange, stilted awkwardness to the actual script that the actors can’t shake.</p><p>Notably, most of the writing credits for <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season go to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://directories.wga.org/project/1235295/the-last-of-us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://directories.wga.org/project/1235295/the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig Mazin</a></span>, one of the showrunners of the series, alongside series director Neil Druckmann. Druckmann and <em>Part II </em>narrative lead Halley Gross have writing credits on the final two episodes of the season, but the bulk of the seven-episode run has Mazin as the sole writing credit. I have to wonder how the writers’ room conversations went down when it came to rearranging these reveals for television and why the show tosses subtlety aside for a blunt, inelegant script in which people just say what they’re thinking to the camera. Abby was once a woman of few words, but Dever’s version tells the room what she’s feeling without a moment’s hesitation. This isn’t a problem exclusive to her in this show, but it was surprising that this tendency was put on such obvious display not once, but twice in the first five minutes.</p><figure id="" data-id="8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-recommend-id="image://8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-recommend-id="image://8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h642554"><a id=""></a><strong>A community worth fighting for</strong></h2><p>Suddenly, <em>The Last of Us </em>jumps forward five years, as <em>Part II </em>did before it. We find a tattooed Ellie sparring with a man twice her size and gaining the upper hand until he taps out. Ellie doesn’t let him out of her grip until Jesse (Young Mazino) snaps her out of her bloodlust. Jesse coaches her, and reveals that he told her sparring partner to pull his punches. Ellie takes offense to this, and it becomes a thread throughout the season that the men around her in Jackson are taking steps to shelter her from the violence she seems to crave.</p><p>I’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-ellie-bella-ramsey-violent-heart-1850224988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-ellie-bella-ramsey-violent-heart-1850224988">written at length</a></span> about how I don’t like the show’s portrayal of Ellie as a person who enjoys the act of violence rather than just someone who believes strongly in the meaning behind it, but season 2’s handling of this thread is so uneven that it’s impossible to unravel just in this first episode. Seeing her tendency toward violence portrayed as a reaction to her being overly sheltered and protected and simply wanting to prove herself is preferable to season one’s notion that she’s just an inherently sadistic person, but <em>The Last of Us </em>is unsure of where this inclination comes from, so we’ll be untangling this messy thread as we track Ellie’s violent spiral throughout the season.</p><p>As Ellie leaves the gym, we get a shot of the Jackson, Wyoming, settlement she and Joel have lived in for five years. It’s a pretty accurate recreation of <em>Part II</em>’s version of the small town, with citizens all working together to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Ellie doesn’t seem convinced by the arrangement, however. She scoffs at the notion of “community” and being part of something bigger than herself. Ellie certainly didn’t seem <em>happy</em> in Jackson in <em>Part II</em>, but again, the show doesn’t care for subtlety and instead has added a new layer of discontent to her arc this time around.</p><p>I hesitate to put this solely on Ramsey, given they are working with the material they’ve been given, but their more youthful performance of Ellie doesn’t work in the character’s favor. Yes, Ramsey is technically older than the 19-year-old Ellie, but where Ashley Johnson’s performance in the games gave Ellie the air of a dejected loner struggling to accept a life she wasn’t content with, Ramsey’s comes off as bratty and childlike. I have trouble buying their performance in even the most neutral of scenes, much less the weightier moments to come.</p><p>Pascal, meanwhile, is daddying his daddiest dad self as Joel, doing handyman shit while entertaining Dina (Isabela Merced), Ellie’s close friend in Jackson. While I think many of the show’s departures from the game are for the worse, I welcome this one. Dina and Joel have basically no interaction whatsoever in <em>Part II</em>, and having the two be close in the show gives both actors an opportunity to shine, and makes up for some of the structural changes the show makes that have condensed Pascal’s role a bit this season. This scene lets Joel be more than the violent smuggler he’s often viewed as, and lets us see him as just a gruff older man trying desperately to connect with the youth. Much of Joel’s legacy in <em>The Last of Us </em>is paved in violence, but when you get him in safe living conditions with more mundane problems like circuitry and teen angst, he’s the embodiment of an oblivious, well-meaning southern dad. “Girl, the war crimes.” I know, I know, but he’s also babygirl.</p><p>But even this nice moment of Joel throwing out some circuitry jargon (whatever you say, beautiful) is cut short by Dina asking what’s up with him and Ellie. Why are these two on the outs, and why does no one else seem to know why? Joel chalks it up to teen angst and rebellion against her father figure. Again, HBO’s <em>The Last of Us </em>loves to codify feelings and questions in the most overt way possible, and somehow, it dives straight into the debate about the surrogate nature of Joel and Ellie’s relationship that fans have been having for years in a way that is surprisingly much more explicit. Joel says he’s her parent, but in a later scene, Gail explicitly says he is not. “I figure it’s normal,” Joel says to Dina. “Her being 19 and me being her...what I am. No one likes their parents at that age. I never got there with my own kid, so we’re both just figuring it out for the first time, is all.”</p><p>Perhaps it’s just my preference for the game’s sparse exploration of these ideas that makes me raise my eyebrows at these changes. Many of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ script tweaks feel like they’re rooted in a need to course-correct public perception or acknowledge fan discourse. Joel and Ellie have what feels like a familial relationship, but so many online arguments regarding Joel’s actions against the Fireflies have been rooted in whether or not they were “actually” family. Does Joel have the right to save Ellie from a lethal surgery if he’s not “really” her father? Can you claim the seemingly almost genetic inclination Ellie has toward retribution comes from Joel if she’s not “actually” his daughter? These matters were never even in consideration for Joel and Ellie before, but suddenly, it’s a concern for this version of the characters after years of discourse made it one. In a vacuum, it’s fine. In the big picture of the franchise, it feels manufactured, like the writers deliberately inserting a community discourse into the minds of characters who never once cared about it.</p><p>Sure, maybe I’m comparing Pascal and Ramsey’s versions of these characters to the originals too much. Still, part of watching an adaptation is wondering what, if anything, is gained and lost in translation. <em>The Last of Us </em>is trapped so rigidly within the confines of the specific story the games tell that every deviation, for good and ill, bears more scrutiny. Compare it to something like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937">the <em>Halo </em>series</a></span>, which tells an entirely different story, or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417">the new <em>Devil May Cry </em>anime</a></span> that reboots the whole continuity. It’s easier to just get on the ride and see what new riffs a team comes up with. The<em> Last of Us</em> show has been so tied up in faithfully recreating what Mazin believes is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030">“the greatest story ever told in video games”</a></span> to a new audience that every time there is a change in the way these characters talk to each other, I have to wonder what Mazin’s team thinks is gained in this expository approach. Am I wrong for thinking that if someone is mostly sticking to the old script but makes notable changes or additions, they think there’s something to be improved upon in the source material? Were those more restrained interactions something Mazin viewed as a weak point in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s storytelling, or is it a kneejerk reaction to the way people talk about it?<em> </em>&nbsp;</p><p>These problems aren’t inherently the medium of television’s fault, but the show certainly has different priorities than the games it’s based on. Whenever Joel, Ellie, Abby, or anyone else pulls subtext out of the ground like the cordyceps roots some workers find infesting the piping of Jackson, it feels oddly condescending, like someone at HBO thinks viewers wouldn’t be smart enough to pick up any of this on their own.</p><p>At any rate, Joel claims he’s not sure what he did to deserve Ellie’s ire, but he’s working on himself in the meantime by going to therapy. Ellie is doing some therapy of her own, sniping infected off Jackson’s border with Joel’s brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna). At the behest of his brother, Tommy has removed Ellie from the patrols that take out infected in the areas surrounding Jackson, and our funky little lesbian is less than thrilled. She’s the only person in the town who’s immune to the cordyceps infection, so in theory, Ellie should be fighting at the frontlines of the infection. But her immunity is a secret. Tommy shushes her when she brings it up, so she then starts shouting it to anyone in a one-mile radius. Again, a reaction that might’ve fit the spritely 14-year-old Ellie in season one but feels out of place for the more world-weary 19-year-old Ramsey is meant to be in this season.</p><figure id="" data-id="772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-recommend-id="image://772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Benji sits on Joel's lap." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Benji sits on Joel's lap." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-recommend-id="image://772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Benji sits on Joel's lap." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Back in Jackson proper, Joel and his sister-in-law Maria (Rutina Wesley) are working on city planning as new refugees enter the enclosure. Maria’s painfully aware that despite her best efforts, Jackson can’t accommodate the number of people coming in looking for food and shelter. The town has buildings, restaurants, infrastructure, and even a governing body, but even the most coordinated mutual aid effort eventually rubs up against the reality of an apocalypse. Maria is idealistic. She believes that she owes it to those in need to help, but Joel says that if the lifeboat is swamped, you leave them outside.</p><p>“You’ve gotta look after your own first, or you’re no good to anyone,” he says casually. I’m sure this was his rationale when he murdered dozens of Fireflies to save Ellie, but Maria judges him from across the room. Then, in comes a brand new character for the show: Tommy and Maria’s son Benji. Joel puts him on his knee and shows him a town map, playfully talking about shooting the “monsters” beyond the wall. Maria’s stare softens, as she’s clearly moved by the sentiment when her child is in front of her. <em>The Last of Us </em>has always positioned family, found or otherwise, as something that shifts one’s perspective, whether toward selflessness or selfishness. So, I’m curious to see how the show wields Benji when it comes to Tommy and Maria’s actions in the future. However, even if she hears Joel, Maria leaves him with the thought that he was a refugee once, too, which he acknowledges with a knowing nod.</p><h2 id="h642555"><a id=""></a><strong>Working on yourself</strong></h2><p>Joel heads to therapy with Gail (Catherine O’Hara), another character made whole cloth for the show. The first season <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-tlou-hbo-joel-anxiety-meds-ellie-1850145039&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-tlou-hbo-joel-anxiety-meds-ellie-1850145039">made a big to-do about Joel’s anxiety</a></span> (another thing that was mostly just implied in the games), so giving him a therapy sideplot feels like the natural next step in the arc. The old man is visibly uncomfortable in Gail’s home. Initially, this comes off as him being unhappy to be doing some self-work, but it quickly becomes clear why he might feel some type of way in this house specifically. Gail offers him tea or whisky before their session starts, then partakes in the latter herself. It’s her birthday, the first without her husband Eugene in 41 years. Game fans will know Eugene as an ex-Firefly who died of old age shortly before the events of the game, but the show has taken some creative liberties with his history.</p><p>Gail reveals that Joel shot and killed her husband, and she hates him for it. Surely it must be more complicated than that if he’s sitting in her home right now. All we know is that Joel “had no choice” and that Gail’s issue is less that Joel murdered Eugene than it is his methods. She expresses all this resentment as a means to pull the same kind of raw honesty out of Joel, who she suspects is holding back in their sessions. Probing into the obvious divide between him and Ellie, Gail asks Joel if he hurt her, to which he tearfully shakes his head. Then he stands up and simply says, “I saved her,” before walking out. Stubborn and sure of himself as ever.</p><p>Of all <em>The Last of Us</em>’ new additions, I probably feel most conflicted about Gail. O’Hara is a charismatic delight as always, and having someone who isn’t scared to call out Joel Miller is a refreshing dynamic. But when the show’s biggest writing problem is a tendency toward unnaturally expositional dialogue that sounds like it’s coming from a YouTube explainer, having a character whose role is to make people talk about their feelings could easily exacerbate the issue. There’s a danger that, rather than Joel and Ellie simply having a traumatic experience, they’ll have to explain it to Gail like a book report, analyzing their lives like a text. Joel’s vague confession here isn’t that overt, but after seeing some of the earlier scenes in the episode, Gail’s presence already makes me wary.</p><figure id="" data-id="932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-recommend-id="image://932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel stands over Gail in her living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel stands over Gail in her living room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-recommend-id="image://932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel stands over Gail in her living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h642556"><a id=""></a><strong>A first date to die for</strong></h2><p>We then shift over to Ellie’s home, a furnished garage in Joel’s backyard. The space is a nearly perfect recreation of her little hut in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, complete with <em>Savage Starlight </em>posters, retro music tapes, and the tobacco sunburst acoustic guitar with the moth decal on the fretboard. I’ve always loved Ellie’s tiny corner of Jackson because it says so much about her, both in the game and the show. Covered in nerdy paraphernalia from a time she can only dream about, Ellie’s room is a nostalgic time capsule for a life she never got to live. Most of the collectibles and swag she’s gathered over the years are here because she managed to stumble upon them in her and Joel’s journey. Her collection of comics and music was salvaged like any bandage or shiv taped together to help them survive. I don’t doubt that she loves the intergalactic adventures of Dr. Daniela Star, but I also find her attachment to one particular comic fascinating because I wonder if the tastes of kids in this world develop organically or if it’s just about whatever they find when rummaging in dusty drawers and shelves. Ellie’s room is built like a scrapbook, things chosen from whatever she finds lying around, to which she imparts special significance.</p><p>That is all much more apparent in the game, as the show doesn’t linger in Ellie’s home for very long. We do get a cool shot of her doing some gun maintenance, which feels like an homage to <em>Part II</em>’s elaborate gun modification animations whenever you upgrade your gear. Then the camera lingers on Ellie’s tattoo, which covers up a chemical burn where her bite mark used to be, but more on that later. Dina shows up and helps Ellie get ready for their patrol before fishing for more info on her and Joel’s little spat. Ellie doesn’t take the bait, though Dina doesn’t strike me as someone to give up that easily.</p><p>The pair collect their horses, including Shimmer, the MVP of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>(if you know, you know), and meet up with Jesse for patrol assignments. There’s palpable tension between the girls and Jesse, who comes off less like a protective older brother to Ellie and more like a jilted, condescending one. Not that those things are mutually exclusive, and perhaps it works better this way considering Ellie’s more young and reckless inclinations in this version of the story. Jesse is a leader in this community, and when you have someone who seems to be jaded toward the very notions of community and responsibility, perhaps it makes more sense for the two of them to be at odds.</p><p>Joining Ellie and Dina on this horse ride is Kat, another character who is only mentioned in Ellie’s diary entries in <em>Part II</em> as her first girlfriend in Jackson. That history remains true in the show, with Dina playfully telling Ellie she should take Kat to the town’s New Year’s dance. She’s “the other one” in Jackson, meaning that yeah, the queer community in this settlement is pretty small, and there seems to be some taboo around it. We’ll unpack this more as the season goes on, but I do feel for Ellie in this moment, being essentially paired off with the one other young lesbian in town just because there’s no one else. Every queer person has a story of a well-meaning friend telling you they have someone they think you should meet and it just happens to be the only other gay person in their orbit. It probably feels even worse when the person saying this to you is a friend you’re obviously crushing on. Dina catches on that Ellie’s got the hots for someone else and offers to go with her as friends, revealing that she and Jesse have broken up (again, for now). Shoot your shot, Ellie.</p><p>The patrol then stumbles upon a gnarly crime-scene-like spectacle of infected corpses strewn around outside an abandoned supermarket, but hey, you should see the other guy. A bear’s remains are at the center of all the carnage, and its guts are hanging out of its body. The grisly (sorry) sight doesn’t deter the two lovebirds as they head into the old grocery store to take out whatever infected stragglers may be lurking within. Despite their flirtatious unseriousness, Dina and Ellie are more than capable of fucking up a group of infected. Merced and Ramsey are fun together as they joke around even in dire circumstances. The actual fight scene between the two and the infected stragglers is full of some cute nods to the games, like Ellie using a glass bottle to distract one of the beasts and then jumping on its back and frantically stabbing it, similar to her stealthy finishing move from <em>Part I</em>. Which, again, also illustrates that Ramsey sure doesn’t feel like the older Ellie of <em>Part II</em>. But it is what it is.</p><p>After taking out one clicker, Ellie falls through the floor to a lower level, and while she thinks she’s alone, it’s only because the infected down here is smart enough to hide. These stalkers are another kind of infected alongside the runners and clickers everyone’s used to. They can sneak, hide, and strategize in a way most infected can’t. Seeing the stalker successfully outsmart and outrun Ellie is pretty terrifying. Bill once said in <em>Part I</em> that infected were easy to deal with because they were predictable, and now Ellie’s finding out that might not be true any longer.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a46e0b925c0d982456169f13f297615" data-recommend-id="image://2a46e0b925c0d982456169f13f297615" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina report back to Jackson's council.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ellie gets bit in the scrap but hides it from Dina because that’s easier than explaining the whole immunity thing. Speaking of difficult things, Ellie does have to explain this new infected to Tommy, Maria, and the rest of a Jackson council. Scene for scene, the <em>Last of Us</em> show spends more time in Jackson than <em>Part II</em> does, so it makes sense that HBO would take this opportunity to delve into the inner workings of how the settlement operates. We knew Maria calls the shots, but it’s nice to know big decisions are made by a committee. There are some hints of division, though, with some suspecting the cluster of infected found in and around the grocery store could indicate a larger infected horde on its way, while others remain skeptical.</p><p>We then get a scene that delves into part of Ellie’s life I hadn’t considered before, and is one of the more interesting moments in the episode that were created just for the show. In order to keep her immunity secret, Ellie has to cut herself further to make the bite mark less apparent, then stitching it like any other wound. She doesn’t go to a medical professional, instead sanitizing her switchblade and making do. Given that the show has changed how the infection works to no longer be airborne, I was curious how season two would handle illustrating Ellie’s immunity, and how she maintains the lie was an interesting bit of specificity that answered a question I hadn’t previously thought about.</p><h2 id="h642557"><a id=""></a><strong>Bridges burned</strong></h2><p>After she cleans the wound, Ellie starts jotting down notes about her day in her diary, another nice homage to <em>Part II</em> in which Ellie periodically writes her innermost thoughts in an old notebook the player can flip through. It’s the closest thing Ellie has to an internal monologue throughout the game, and it was certainly a better way of getting insight into her thought process than the more expository dialogue of the show. Those little glimpses into Ellie’s mind felt like they were written for her, and we just got a chance to read them and maybe gain some greater understanding of the violent conquest we were on. Meanwhile, the show’s dialogue in which Ellie expresses those feelings to someone else feels written for an assumed audience. Sure, all dialogue is written with an assumed audience, but masking that is not the show’s forte.</p><p>Joel shows up and asks if Ellie’s heading to the dance tonight, and it’s clear there’s tension between the two of them that neither wants to acknowledge outright. Joel does what he does best and insists on doing something for her despite her protests, pointing out that her guitar’s strings need changing and leaving with it.</p><figure id="" data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we see one of the best scenes in all of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>: the dance, a sequence so good in the game that I was really glad to see the writers largely left it alone here. Dina dancing to Crooked Still’s “Little Sadie,” Ellie being a wallflower on the sidelines, and then the extroverted friend rushing to the introverted one and pulling her onto the dancefloor. The exchange between the two as Crooked Still’s “Ecstacy” plays in the background is still one of my favorites in the series. Every line is meticulously thought out, illustrating Ellie’s insecurity and Dina’s flirtatious confidence, and watching those two feelings collide in a kiss is downright electric. God, what a perfect fucking scene, right down to the moment when Seth (Robert John Burke), the town bigot, interrupts to throw a slur onto the dance floor in front of dozens of people. But in comes Ally of the Year Joel to knock him on his ass. Ellie lashes out and tells Joel she doesn’t want his help, so he leaves with his tail between his legs. Ellie is regretful but also clearly embarrassed by the scene that Seth and Joel just made.</p><p>As she heads back home, she sees Joel on his back porch, playing the restrung guitar. They lock eyes briefly before Ellie walks past him without stopping. Game fans know that scene goes down a bit differently, and I was genuinely shocked not only to see Joel sitting on that porch in the first episode but also to see Ellie walking past him without a word. By this point, I wasn’t sure what to make of this; the conversation that Joel and Ellie have on that porch is foundational to the story of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so when I saw this deviation in “Future Days,” I was more intrigued by it than anything else in the episode because I wondered how HBO’s adaptation would make up for not including it. But that’s a question for another episode, I suppose.</p><p>For now, we end “Future Days” with the citizens of Jackson in danger, both from inside and outside the settlement. The Cordyceps fungus is spreading in the pipes, and Abby and Owen are shown just outside the town’s border. It looks like this quiet, small-town refuge is about to become a battleground.</p><hr><p><em>The Last of Us </em>airs on Max, Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 system has been increased in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia due to a challenging economic environment.</p>
<p>With a rather unusual and somewhat suspect very early Monday announcement for the affected territories, SIE has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the price of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition has been increased to €499.99 in Europe, £429.99 in the United Kingdom, AUD $829.95 in Australia and NZD $949.95 in New Zealand as of today, April 14th. The price of the console's regular edition is unaffected, as is the price of the PlayStation 5 Pro. The price increase, according to Vice President of Global Marketing Isabelle Tomatis, has been caused by a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates, although, given the timing, the tariff situation between the United States and China is likely one of the factors that made SIE increase the console's price.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Disc Drive is also getting its price revised, although downwards. Starting today, April 14th, the Drive will be priced at €79.99 in Europe, £69.99 in the UK, AUD $124.95 in Australia, and NZD $139.95.</p>
<p>Price hikes are nothing new for the PlayStation 5, as the system's price was already increased in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">2022</a> in Europe,&nbsp;<span>the UK, and Australia, among other territories, before being increased again<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;last August</a> in Japan by around $90. With the current economic situation likely to continue being </span>challenging for a good while, it's possible that the system may see a price increase in other markets as well.</p>

<p>Sony has announced that it is going to increase the price of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The announcement came via a PlayStation Blog post on Sunday evening.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Starting April 14</a>, the cost of the PS5 Digital Edition in all affected regions and PS5 Physical Edition in both Australia and New Zealand will see an increase. Sony says that the price increase is a “tough decision” due to a “challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates”.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-titanfall-3-rumors-return-and-what-is-xbox-planning-to-show-fans-this-year">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-titanfall-3-rumors-return-and-what-is-xbox-planning-to-show-fans-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titanfall 3 Rumors Return And What Is Xbox Planning To Show Fans This Year?</a></h6>



<p>The new PS5 prices in the four regions are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Europe:&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>PS5 Digital Edition €499.99&nbsp;(Physical remains the same)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>£429.99&nbsp;(Physical remains the same)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Australia:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard (Physical) Edition – AUD $829.95</li>



<li>PS5 Digital Edition – AUD $749.95</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard (Physical) Edition – NZD $949.95 </li>



<li>PS5 Digital Edition – NZD $859.95</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The cost of the PS5 Pro will remain the same. And Sony is also lowering the price of the PS5 Disc Drive slightly. </p>



<p>Those new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Europe:&nbsp;</strong>€79.99</li>



<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;£69.99&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Australia:</strong>&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>



<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong>&nbsp;NZD $139.95</li>
</ul>



<p>As of publishing, it’s unclear if Sony plans to increase the price of the PS5 in other regions such as the United States and Canada. Currently, the United States’ planned tariffs are on hold for 90 days. Should they be reintroduced, it could continue to upend the same market that led Nintendo to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying pre-orders</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aforementioned countries</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-bongo-cat-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bongo Cat was released on Steam on March 5, and in the time it has been online, it has racked up a review rating of <strong>Overwhelmingly Positive</strong>. As I write this, 130,000 people are playing the game on Steam, but <strong>what even is it</strong>? The game’s description on Steam doesn’t give anything away, leaving many to wonder what Bongo Cat is and why it is going insane on Steam.</p>



<p>Here’s the description, which will make more sense once you’ve read through the explanation below:</p>



<p><em>‘Bongo cat needs your help. Bongo cat needz more hatz!!! Every time you press a key, Bongo Cat will punch your taskbar. Type, click, play, and work to collect more points. Which hats will you find?’</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-hatz">More Hatz</h2>



<p>If you remember the banana-themed game on Steam that was aptly named <strong>Banana</strong>, then you’ll understand some of the premise for Bongo Cat.</p>



<p>In Banana, players were presented with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a banana that they clicked on</a>. The more they clicked, the more banana skins (get it?) they earned, and the kicker was that they could take those skins and trade them on the Steam Marketplace. That’s how Banana managed to skyrocket to a peak concurrent player count of more than 900,000 Steam users.</p>



<p>What is Bongo Cat? Think of it as being <strong>Banana</strong>, but replace the fruit with a cat, and instead of doing nothing when you click on it, the cat slaps your taskbar. It sits over whatever you’re doing, and everything you do will earn another slap – clicking, typing, and so on. As you rack up points, you’ll earn new cats, hats, and other items, such as emotes and floating icons.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-bongo-cat">What’s the Point of Bongo Cat?</h2>



<p>It’s not enough to know what Bongo Cat is, you must also understand <strong>what the point of the game is</strong>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t really have much of a point, but the game’s <strong>feature list </strong>on Steam mentions that it will be ‘A friend while working hard.’</p>



<p>As you collect points, you can unlock items that range from Common to Legendary, and when you get them, you’re free to trade and sell them within the Steam Marketplace. </p>



<p>And now you understand why Bongo Cat is soaring in popularity – it’s because there’s a slight chance of making some money on the game.</p>



<p>If you want to give Bongo Cat a try, you get get it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for free now on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-q-a.1163298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-qa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>TiMi Studio’s signature multiplayer title may not as well known as other MOBA contemporaries outside the Asian market, but Honor of Kings remains one of the most-played titles in the genre. In mainland China, Honor of Kings will be celebrating its tenth anniversary later this year, while the global/Western release only debuted last year. This Multiplayer Online Battle Arena is branching out into new genres for the first time with a (not so massive) multiplayer online RPG titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-resurfaces-with-gorgeous-gdc-2025-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor of Kings: World</a> due out sometime later this year. With a new genre comes a new potential to reach a target audience that might have otherwise overlooked this Chinese epic.</p>
<p>At GDC 2025, Tencent allowed me to jump into a pair of missions and experience a bit of the story, with the implication that this was still fairly early on in the adventure as the main character was still getting a grasp of his powers. Rather than picking a single weapon type and sticking with it, Honor of Kings: World lets players pick a pair of classes from a wide range of melee, spellcasters, and ranged combatants. Each of the different classes holds a similar breadth of skills to one another, from three standard attacks unique to that class, a dodge or evasive ability, and some form of ultimate attack. There’s clearly the potential to mix and match some powerful combinations with class attacks, usually conferring some sort of elemental attack and either a positive buff for the player or a negative debuff for any poor fodder enemies in their path.</p>
<p>In a character action game, the melee combat remains the standard to judge first and foremost, and I’m pleased with how Honor of Kings World makes each weapon feel dynamically different. It’s actually the ranged combat that drew me in and made my experience for this brief hour memorable. One of the eleven classes gave my hero character a massive gun, complete with an active reload mechanic and more than enough supporting fire to never stop firing on the enemy. Large swords are undeniably cool, but pulling off solid ranged combat in a character action game will always capture my heart.</p>
<p>Honor of Kings: World showed off only a small slice of the levels, from a couple of encounters that went straight into boss fights to a moderately lengthy dungeon filled with side paths containing loot and a couple of environmental puzzles. Admittedly, one of the puzzles stumped me because I was thrown into a dungeon without having done a tutorial that would teach me that ice grenades can freeze movable blocks in place. I can’t fault the developers for having to point me in the right direction when I solved two-thirds of a puzzle for a hidden treasure chest but couldn’t finish the final piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>It may not have been on my radar before GDC 2025, but I would absolutely check out Honor of Kings: World again sometime later this year. While no PlayStation release is a bit of a bummer, the UI and bite-sized missions would be perfect on the go for mobile gamers. After the hands-on, I chatted a bit with Simon, the lead designer for&nbsp;this project.</p>
<p><iframe title="GDC 2025 Announcement Trailer | Honor of Kings: World" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oFTbOeyFUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about Honor of Kings: World for newcomers.</strong></p>
<p>We are a next-generation multiplayer adventure RPG. We started from the original IP and we are ready to take it to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>How much of the IP's DNA is there in Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's in everything because of the way we started this project. We took the core concept, like the combat, but then we elevated it. As you can see, every combat style you play is actually a champion from the game, and we actually turned it into a three-dimensional action experience. Also, the story and the world are from the MOBA.</p>
<p><strong>How many of the champions from Honor of Kings will be playable in this new game?</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, I hope all of them, but we are starting with the first champions from the first region because we don't want players to have this feeling like there are hundreds of champions. So, the way we do it is that we introduce a region and the champions who are related to the region and the story. We introduce players to them, and through the updates, we will add more and more and more champions.</p>
<p><strong>Since players are controlling two separate champions, how do you go about balancing the synergy?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the player is the protagonist. This protagonist has the power to master the flow of the others, so he's learning abilities from the champions. That's the whole concept. We also try to provide you with the fun of this dramatic difference from each combat style, but we still try to keep it at the same level.</p>
<p>If you play the game like a single player experience, I think the difference is the fun part of it. For example, when you select the character with a gun, the shooting and dodging are emphasized a lot. It's a different kind of experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to the multiplayer, you have a little bit of positioning. If you're into counterattacks, you're supposed to engage with the boss constantly. But if you're a ranger, you're supposed to be providing the damage. Then you have something like a support character role, but we want everything, every class in the multiplayer also to be able to fight back, not just like standing there and healing.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that Honor of Kings World is trying to do away with the holy trinity of tank, damage dealer, and healer?</strong></p>
<p>We are not going fully exactly on that. The baseline is still that, even if you're a support character, you are meant to have a great action experience. Since you can access two classes, you can actually switch between support and DPS. I mean, if you really want to go for a full support role, you can do that. But normally, you can switch to another style and get into DPS mode, depending on the occasion of the combat.</p>
<p><strong>Can Honor of Kings: World be played entirely solo?</strong></p>
<p>You can if you want. We actually provide quite a lot of a single player experience. It's an option. We provide a non-invasive multiplayer experience for you. At some point, it's always convenient to play with others. Let's say that you feel like a boss fight is too difficult. As a player, you can always call for help,&nbsp;but it's not going to be disruptive.</p>
<p><strong>Can you bring in AI companions?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's like an assistant function. If you can't find a friend or you just want to play alone, then there are options for AI companions in the dungeons or stuff like that. So it's more like an accessible assistant function to that.</p>
<p><strong>How's the matchmaking? Can you select, like, I want to play this specific mission and the game tries to match you with other players?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's very straightforward. When you are going to a dungeon, then if you want a team, you can just match with players who are similar to your rank.</p>
<p><strong>At launch, how will players have access to the characters? Will they have access to the whole initial roster? Will they just have access to one or two?</strong></p>
<p>I think we provide several in the storyline, like a basic set. It's actually still quite a few. The way actually way you progress in the story, you get to meet the champions and get familiar with them, and then you learn their abilities. You will have a basic combo set along the way, and it's tailor-made for you to understand the system. Then later on, if you want more, you would just go for purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Are you talking about the business model for Honor of Kings: World yet?</strong></p>
<p>What I can tell you is that we are building monetization around social, so it's going to be around outfits and skins, nothing that is pay-to-win.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know roughly how much buying an additional champion would cost?</strong></p>
<p>We're still working on that.</p>
<p><strong>Are there already any plans for a premium or battle pass?</strong></p>
<p>I think that's very possible in the future. Since monetization is at an early stage of testing right now, we don't have a detailed fixed rule on that, but I think something like that is very likely.</p>
<p><strong>Will Honor of Kings: World be free to play, or do players have to make an initial purchase to play?</strong></p>
<p>No, it's a free-to-play game, so&nbsp;no purchase at all.</p>
<p><strong>Which platforms are you launching on?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are focusing on PC and mobile. Hopefully, consoles will be in the future too, but right now, we're focusing on the first two.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a cross-progression between PC and mobile platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Mobile is more like an accessible way for you to play anytime, but it's as if it were the same platform.</p>
<p><strong>Will you have controller support?</strong></p>
<p>Not right now, but we can tell it's really important here, and so I think we will probably have that in the future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Especially for mobile, not everyone prefers playing lengthy RPGs with just the touchscreen.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think it's quite important, but right now, we are trying to polish the native mobile experience first.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any crossover events or content planned between Honor of Kings and Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>We're talking about it since we are the same IP and the same team. We are gradually talking about how do we actually - I mean, the narrative is already kind of merging together. We are at an early phase of the discussions right now.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of release window do you have in mind for Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a specific date. What I can tell you is that we are working really hard to bring it online as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Do you have any beta tests planned in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a detailed plan yet. But what we're doing is we are constantly testing through private tests. Every couple of months, we try to iterate the game as quickly as possible. So, I think we can expect further tests in the future,</p>
<p><strong>For fans who may play the MOBA a lot but are not as comfortable or familiar with playing action RPGs, do you have any difficulty or accessibility options for this game?</strong></p>
<p>For now, we are focused on polishing the content. Later on, we should definitely consider that. Even with the mobile version, we must consider a lot of control polishing. I think that's definitely going to be on the radar in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anywhere to sign up or wishlist Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet. We are still working on it. But we'll try our best to bring it to the wishlists as quickly as possible in the future.</p>
<p><strong>When's the next event where players will see more of the game?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know, but we'd love to keep the momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-gave-us-battle-royale-casual-but-where%E2%80%99s-multiplayer-casual.1163292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battle-royale-multiplayer-casual-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Verdansk came back on April 3, it brought ‘Battle Royale Casual’ with it, an all-new mode packed with bots to give players a much more forgiving experience. Given how I love Call of Duty’s multiplayer platforms but hate sweating against cracked players and the punishing SBMM mechanics, I’m wondering where my ‘Multiplayer Casual’ playlists are.</p>



<p>It’s not an unheard-of concept. In 2022 and 2023, Modern Warfare II and III featured a mode called ‘Invasion’, which was a large-scale multiplayer mode stacked with bots – and it was <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s get some simple playlists sorted out for the less talented player who just wants to chill out and shoot guns.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-struggle">No Struggle</h2>



<p>Before labelling me a crazy person, look at this. I was inspired to explore this topic thanks to a post on <a href="https://x.com/DETONATEDcom/status/1911230593662099703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter by DETONATED</a>, which held a poll that had some <strong>very </strong>telling results:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That post and the subsequent poll got me thinking…</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s skill-based matchmaking mechanics were broken down by their creator during a recent episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a>. They’re not as nefarious as you might think, but they’re designed in a way that keeps you on your toes and in lobbies with players around your ‘calculated’ skill level.</p>



<p>It does mean that, at times, you’ll be lumped in with players that walk out of the lobby with a 4.0 K/D.</p>



<p>It was also confirmed a while ago that Call of Duty’s studios <strong>never </strong>inject bots into any multiplayer matches, which is something that other games have done historically. Sure, they’ve mostly been battle royale games with much higher player counts in a single game, but you can downsize the logic, surely.</p>



<p>Invasion was the perfect example of ‘Multiplayer Casual’. It put players in large, sweeping maps with hundreds of bots and a decent array of real players, making it feel like a full-fledged battlefield (no pun or reference intended). It meant that you’d likely end a match with hundreds of kills, and you never had to go looking for enemies.</p>



<p>Invasion was <strong>dropped </strong>coming into Black Ops 6, which left a gaping hole in my rotation.</p>



<p>Here’s my question:</p>



<p>If we can have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale Casual</a> packed with bots that allows you to experience the same game but earn fewer experience points, why can’t we have a Multiplayer Casual mode that serves the same purpose?</p>



<p>Folks can grind camos, learn the maps, play modes that they usually wouldn’t, experiment with non-meta weapons, and so on, all while avoiding cheaters, punishing SBMM mechanics, and potentially connection issues (if it was entirely a bot lobby, of course).</p>



<p>That poll says that I’m not alone, but I’m just wondering how the logistics of a Multiplayer Casual mode would work.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about this concept in the comments, or join the community over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Meet DMZ: Nuclear Survival, a new PVE and competitive PVP multiplayer open-world survival crafting game set in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. It's coming "soon" in early access so that the "brand-new, ambitious, and highly flexible" game can grow alongside its community.</p>
<p>It's thought the game - which hasn't indicated a price, but has at least confirmed it won't be free-to-play - will be in early access for the inaugural year, although that "depends upon development progress and player feedback". You can check it out in the teaser below, which debuted at Indie Live Expo 2025 earlier today:</p>

<p>Developed by a two-person team in Saitama, Japan, DMZ is the debut title from newly formed studio Wild Dog. It takes place on the supercontinent "Pangaea, a "vast, procedurally generated" environment featuring a variety of biomes, including forests, wastelands, deserts, and snowfields. The game's lore suggests it was formed by tectonic shifts caused by the war, where "intense battles for survival" unfolded. Players can excavate ancient ruins scattered across the land - such as pyramids, Terracotta warriors, and Roman temples - and research relics, craft items, and "even resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes to revive a fallen civilization and fight for survival".</p>
<p>You'll also get to capture NPCs and bring them back to base to become companions, each one with a specialty that may come in handy. Non-human recruits like Bears, wolves, and, er, ostriches are also available. Players can also set up shop on dedicated servers to "play with over 100 players", although offline single-player mode is also available.</p>
<p>The duo hope the final version will introduce new biomes and locations, "enhance soldier and NPC development features, improve PvE and PvP mechanics, add craftable technologies, and implement server updates that allow more players to participate simultaneously".</p>
<p>For more, head on over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/">Steam page</a>, which informs me there'll be in-app purchases and full controller support.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>However, with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a> - described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - now live, despite participants needing to sign an NDA before they can get involved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay is already popping up in various corners of the internet</a>. And EA is not happy.</p>
<p>Whilst at first, with mostly positive news leaking, EA seemed pretty content to let the rumours fly, the team is now cracking down on the leaks, saying that no one wins when "information and content [...] is shared out of context".</p>

<p>Global community manager Totalfps hit back at a grumpy reddit thread about purported skill-based-matchmaking, cutting the commenter off with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>"Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way," Totalfps wrote."I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line.</p>
<p>"This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We've long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield."</p>
<p>Totalfps added that "there is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities", but now "is not it", and "the constant reposting of things is not that time or place" yet, either.</p>

<p>"While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community."</p>
<p>Totalfps stressed the Labs program exists because EA "wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again", but it "cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/647048/switch-2-versus-rog-ally-x-asus-nintendo-specs-price-screen-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has entered the ring, possibly complicating your decision of which handheld to buy this year. While Nintendo’s new console, which comes out on June 5th, may seem similar to handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally, there’s a lot that sets them apart. Everything like how you buy and play games, their control methods, how powerful they are, and how you can expand their storage makes them different. Unique doesn’t always mean “good,” by the way.</p><p>While tech-savvy folks likely understand the key differences between each of the major handhelds, possibly enough to establish a preference, some could use a hand breaking things down. That’s exactly what I’m going to do here, specifically comparing the Switch 2 to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus ROG Ally</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Ally X</a>, two of the most popular handheld gaming PCs that aren’t a Steam Deck (in small part because they’re easy to buy at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus%2Flearn-about-rog-ally%2Fpcmcat1678398541884.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1678398541884" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>). I’ve already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/642866/nintendo-switch-2-steam-deck-lcd-oled-comparison-specs-price">compared the Switch 2 to Valve’s console</a>, so my focus here is exclusively on Asus’ consoles that have a dedicated fanbase and some great specs.</p><div><p id="pricing-and-availability"><h2>Pricing and availability</h2></p></div><p>As mentioned, the Switch 2 will launch on June 5th. Preorders were initially set to begin on April 9th, but were pushed due to the Trump administration’s global tariffs. While that situation remains in flux, it’s possible that preorders will have begun (or will soon), depending on when you read this. Assuming no changes from tariffs, the Switch 2 will be available in two pricing configurations, each with 256GB of internal storage; the $449.99 base console and a $499.99 bundle that also includes <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>. </p><p>The Asus ROG Ally is available in multiple configurations, most of which are discounted regularly (sometimes <em>steeply</em>, but for the purposes of this post, I’m going to share original retail prices). It starts at $499.99 and features the AMD Ryzen Z1 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, while electing for the more powerful version with the Z1 Extreme APU (and no other spec improvements) bumps the price up to $649.99.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The ROG Ally X has so many improvements that it might as well be the ROG Ally 2 — and you’ll pay a premium for them. We’ll go into more detail below, but pricing starts at $799.99 for the Z1 Extreme model with 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a bigger battery. Doubling the storage to 2TB adds $100, totaling $899.99.</p><div><p id="display-technology"><h2>Display technology</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 and all Asus ROG Ally models (even the Ally X) have some specs in common. They each have 1080p LCD touchscreens with a 120Hz refresh rate. However, Nintendo’s handheld has a larger screen (7.9 inches to 7 inches, respectively). The Switch 2’s screen goes toe-to-toe with the Ally X with variable refresh rate (VRR), which is a great feature to have — and quite the shock to have it in the sub-$500 Switch 2 — as it prevents the screen from displaying choppiness as the frame rate fluctuates. While the Ally and Ally X feature AMD’s FreeSync Premium, the Switch 2 has a G-Sync display and HDR.</p><p>Nintendo hasn’t shared the peak brightness for the Switch 2’s screen yet, but the ROG Ally models go up to 500 nits.</p><div><p id="performance-and-battery-life"><h2>Performance and battery life</h2></p></div><p>The ROG Ally — and especially the ROG Ally X — offer some of the best performance of any handheld gaming PCs on the market. While one might think its Z1 Extreme processor is getting long in the tooth, it debuted in 2023, it’s faster than the Steam Deck, and more capable than the Z2 Go that failed to impress us in its 2025 debut device, the Lenovo Legion Go S. </p><p>You’ll get the best performance in the pricey ROG Ally X (let <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister show you some game-by-game frames per second breakdowns <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc#:~:text=Speaking%20of%20benchmarks%2C%20Alan%20Wake%20II%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20only%20game%20where%20the%20Ally%20X%20pulls%20ahead.%20Despite%20having%20the%20same%20AMD%20Ryzen%20Z1%20Extreme%20chip%20as%20the%20original%20ROG%20Ally%2C%20the%20faster%20memory%2C%20more%20efficient%20cooling%2C%20and%20power%20tweaks%20make%20their%20mark.">in his review</a>), thanks to its faster memory and more efficient cooling compared to the standard ROG Ally. But even the more affordable models offer a more-than-acceptable baseline, running many popular games at over 60 frames per second at 720p, and in some cases, at 1080p. Several titles can run above 100 frames per second.</p><p>The ROG Ally runs at higher power levels than the Steam Deck, yet it’s unclear whether that’s the case for the Nintendo Switch 2 as well. Nintendo is promising up to 120 frames per second with some Switch 2-exclusive titles that offer performance modes, but we’ll have to wait and see what kinds of visual compromises were made to achieve such a rare feat for a handheld. </p><p>The Switch 2 differs drastically from the ROG Ally models because of its custom Nvidia processor. While exact spec details about this Nvidia processor are slim, Nvidia has confirmed that the Switch 2 supports DLSS (Nvidia’s graphics upscaling tech), which will likely be leaned on to achieve fast frame rates in games at 1080p resolution in handheld mode and at up to 4K while the console is docked. We’re curious how DLSS looks in a low-powered device (the also-Nvidia-powered Switch from 2017 predated DLSS’ existence). For comparison, the ROG Ally supports AMD’s comparable FSR upscaling tech, though the integration sometimes results in a fuzzy-looking image.</p><p>In terms of battery life, Sean Hollister was left wanting more out of the ROG Ally consoles. While its 40Wh capacity matches the Steam Deck, it spends its battery reserve faster, even in low power modes. Hollister said in his ROG Ally review that four hours of battery life was the best case scenario compared to the Steam Deck’s seven. A lot was improved on in the ROG Ally X, beyond its impressively large 80Wh internal battery. Hollister reports that the Ally X is less power-hungry than the original, letting you game for longer.</p><p>Nintendo is currently being cagey about battery specs in the Switch 2, only sharing that it contains a 5,220mAh lithium-ion battery. It advertises battery life ranging from two to six and a half hours, depending on the game.</p><p>It’s a little strange to talk about joysticks in the performance section, but the ROG Ally models feature Hall effect joysticks, while the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Switch 2 does not</a>. Those operate with magnetized mechanisms instead of potentiometers, allowing the sticks to not wear down over time, leading to worsening performance and inaccurate inputs. Given the controversy surrounding Nintendo’s Joy-Con drift, we’re surprised and disappointed that Nintendo opted not to go with Hall-effect sticks.</p><div><p id="storage-and-docking"><h2>Storage and docking</h2></p></div><p>Both the Switch 2 and ROG Ally models use fast internal storage, albeit different types. The Switch 2 features 256GB of UFS storage (non-upgradeable), and can be expanded with microSD Express cards, which are classified as PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSDs but have the same microSD card form factor many of us are accustomed to. </p><p>The standard ROG Ally includes an M.2-2230 SSD (user-replaceable), but you’ll need to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/506956/how-to-install-m2-ssd-asus-rog-ally-x">open it up</a> to replace it. This maneuver won’t void your warranty, but it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQ24SghjZ0">not as simple as you might hope</a>. For something simpler, the ROG Ally supports microSD cards, including UHS-II versions with faster read and write speeds. The latter can be expensive and tough to find in stock, so I recommend going the SSD upgrade route if you really want more storage.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>One of the many improvements in the ROG Ally X is the support for M.2-2280 SSDs, full-size M.2 SSDs that aren’t shrunk down to fit into tiny gadgets. Those SSDs are much easier to find in large storage capacities (and are often discounted), so it’s a bonus that the ROG Ally X supports them as well as microSD cards.</p><p>Moving on to docking, the Switch 2 and the ROG Ally were both designed as hybrid consoles that can be enjoyed as a handheld, or by linking up to an external screen. Docking is more core to the Switch 2 experience, just as it was with the original Switch, since Nintendo includes a TV dock with the console. With it, you can game at up to 4K resolution, capped at 60 frames per second over HDMI. The dock is low-frills, containing an Ethernet port, a USB-C power plug, an HDMI port, and two USB-A 2.0 ports.</p><p>None of the ROG Ally consoles include a dock (only a 65W USB-C power adapter), though Asus makes one that’s similar in execution to the Genki Covert Dock. It’s a 65W power brick with an HDMI 2.0 port to connect to a display, and one USB-A 2.0 port for connecting an accessory. It costs $64.99 through <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-65w-charger-dock-supports-hdmi-2-0-with-usb-type-a-and-usb-type-c-for-rog-ally-black%2F6542054.p%3FskuId%3D6542054" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, but you’re better off getting something cheaper on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rog+ally+dock&amp;i=electronics&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> from JSAUX or Anker, both of which make docks that rival the official Steam Deck docking station in terms of ports.</p><p>Of course, if you’re rolling in it, feel free to buy the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frog.asus.com%2Fus%2Fexternal-graphic-docks-group%2Fallmodels%2F" rel="sponsored">ROG XG Mobile external GPU</a> that doubles as a docking station. It plugs into the ROG Ally’s proprietary port on the top, and it’s the cost of a high-end gaming laptop. I don’t recommend it because it’s super expensive, and yet, you’ll be bottlenecked by the speed of the ROG Ally’s Ryzen Z1 APU. The ROG Ally X dropped support for the XG Mobile.</p><div><p id="games-and-software"><h2>Games and software</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 and ROG Ally have some games in common. Many games coming to the Switch 2 in 2025 are already out on PC, including <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, and more (and are sometimes discounted, no less). But how you buy games on them is different, and that comes down to the software. While the Switch 2 is limited to titles on the eShop, the ROG Ally runs Windows 11. As such, you’re free to install any game platform available on that OS. That includes Steam, the Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, and others. Games are more affordable on PCs (the ROG Ally is a PC, despite its handheld form factor).</p><p>While the ability to run any game from any platform is one of Windows’ biggest advantages against the Switch 2 (and compared to the Steam Deck, as well), there are downsides. Namely, Windows 11 isn’t a great experience for handhelds, as the OS doesn’t adapt well to the built-in controls and touchscreen. On the other hand, connecting a mouse and keyboard? That’s another story. The Asus ROG Ally will be among the first handhelds not made by Valve to be supported by official SteamOS in an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">update coming soon</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 has a special mouse mode, for which developers are creating control schemes. Games that support it will allow you to play with standard controls, then seamlessly switch to mouse-based controls when the player turns the Joy-Con 2 so that its sensor faces a hard surface. It’s intriguing, but ROG Ally players aren’t missing out on much because they can connect a wireless mouse to play their favorite games.</p><div><p id="by-the-numbers"><h2>By the numbers</h2></p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Specification</h3></th><th><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Ally X</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Ally</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck LCD</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Custom Nvidia chipset (details TBD)</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td><td>Custom AMD APU</td></tr><tr><td>Screen type</td><td>7.9-inch LCD</td><td>7-inch LCD</td><td>7-inch LCD</td><td>7-inch LCD</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (handheld)</td><td>1,920 x 1080, up to 120Hz, VRR, HDR</td><td>1,920 x 1,080, up to 120Hz, VRR</td><td>1,920 x 1,080, up to 120Hz</td><td>1,280 x 800, up to 60Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (docked)</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz, or 1440p/1080p at up to 120Hz</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz, or 1440p at 120Hz</td></tr><tr><td>HDR10 support?</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Internal storage</td><td>256GB (UFS, non-upgradable)</td><td>1TB or 2TB (PCIe 4 M2-2280, user-replaceable)</td><td>512GB (PCIe 4 M2-2230, user-replaceable)</td><td>256GB (M2-2230, user-replaceable)</td></tr><tr><td>Expandable storage</td><td>microSD Express (up to 2TB)</td><td>microSD UHS-II</td><td>microSD UHS-II</td><td>microSD (up to 2TB)</td></tr><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>Accelerometer / gyroscope, mouse / ambient light sensor (in console)</td><td>Fingerprint / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td><td>Fingerprint / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td><td>Accelerometer / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Ports (handheld)</td><td>2x USB-C / 3.5mm</td><td>2x USB-C / 3.5mm</td><td>1x USB-C / 3.5mm / XG Mobile port</td><td>USB-C / 3.5mm</td></tr><tr><td>Ports (dock)</td><td>2x USB-C / HDMI / ethernet</td><td>USB 2.0 / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI 2.0 (dock not included)</td><td>USB 2.0 / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI 2.0 (dock not included)</td><td>3x USB-A 3.1 / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI 2.0 / DisplayPort 1.4 / Ethernet (dock not included)</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi 6 / Bluetooth / NFC</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.2</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.2</td><td>Dual-band Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 5</td></tr><tr><td>Wired connectivity</td><td>Ethernet (docked mode)</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td></tr><tr><td>Built-in mic?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td></tr><tr><td>Battery capacity</td><td>5,220mAh lithium-ion</td><td>80Wh battery</td><td>40Wh battery</td><td>40Wh battery</td></tr><tr><td>Battery life (est.)</td><td>2 to 6.5 hours</td><td>2 to 10 hours</td><td>2 to 4 hours</td><td>2 to 8 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Charging time</td><td>About 3 hours 30 minutes</td><td>Not advertised</td><td>Not advertised</td><td>Not advertised</td></tr><tr><td>Game card slot</td><td>Switch 2 and Switch cartridges</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (grams)</td><td>399.16g (or 535.24g with Joy-Con 2 controllers attached)</td><td>678 grams</td><td>608 grams</td><td>669 grams</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>4.5 x 10.7 x .55 inches</td><td>4.37 x 11.02 x 0.97-1.45 inches</td><td>4.37 x 11.02 x 0.83-1.28 inches</td><td>4.6 x 11.7 x 1.92 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>$449.99</td><td>$799.99</td><td>$499.99</td><td>$399.99</td></tr><tr><td>Available</td><td>June 5th, 2025</td><td>Now</td><td>Now</td><td>Now</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-season-2-episode-1-review-welcome-back-to-apocalypse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HBO's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf991e9-1624-48e4-90de-202719d86a32" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-hbo-last-of-us-episode-1-adapt-game" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> was an incredible achievement for was a very spotty history of video-game-to-TV adaptations. It managed to convey the tense tones of the fungal apocalypse with the heartbreak of our protagonists for those they they loved, and the eventual repairing of those breaks with what they found. Season 2 has just begun, and we're excited to see how this quality can be maintained as they move into the storyline of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>

<p>Ahead of the premiere, TechRaptor was lucky enough to watch <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;season 2 Eeisode 1. <strong>Keep in mind there will be some spoilers for the episode below as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Season 2 opens with a reminder of the status quo at the end of the first. We see the final exchange between Joel and Ellie, her making him swear that what he said about the Fireflies was true, before we get to see a funeral scene attended by the surviving Fireflies and our introduction to Abby, played by Kaitlyn Dever, and her vendetta against Joel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Slowly… [...] When we kill him, we kill him slowly" - Abby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This short opening sequence does a great job of reminding viewers where we were when we left off from season one, while setting up important characters for this next leg of the journey before jumping ahead five years into the future.</p>

<p>The rest of the episode is set largely in the city in Wyoming, catching the viewer up on where everyone is in life, what the current status of relations are, and showing that in this post-apocalyptic world it is possible to live a relatively normal life.</p>

<p>Here we get to see Joel going about as City Planner, working to fix up new houses for settlers who need a place to stay or fixing breakers by hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The largest change in these five years has been the relationship between Joel and Ellie. In season one, the father/daughter dynamic grew when they needed to rely on one another for protection. They still have that father/daughter relationship but with Joel helicoptering (probably a side effect of the horrific way he lost his first daughter) and Ellie coming out of being a teenager and wanting to be seen as an adult she tries to distance herself.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that even while their scenes together were tense--and who couldn't feel for Pedro Pascal's brooding expressions--that they felt very real and very normal for an otherwise not-normal world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=LFmVRiac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=YjR0KJXv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ellie dilligently cleaning her weapons in the garage.</figcaption></figure><p>These 'normal' moments also do some heavy lifting to set up narrative flags, but we know that for there to be a season, there has to be conflict--even if you haven't played the games--so you can feel that these happier moments are being set up to be reflected back upon.</p>

<p>Ellie's rebellion continues on a raid where she and Dina, played by Isabela Merced, take out some clickers in an abandoned building. This character, who was teased in season 1, is Ellie's main love interest for the season and a confidant for her. We don't get to see too much other than their flirty banter, self-assuredness when taking out the infected, and their kiss, but I'm looking forward to seeing more of their relationship develop.</p>

<p>This scene also introduces the plotline of a talking infected. This is only lightly touched on, so I'm intrigued to see where this goes as the season continues.</p>

<h2>The Powerful Small Moments</h2>

<p>For a TV show about infected mushroom people and the collapse of society, my favorite scene in the episode wasn't about action or stealth but was when Joel went to visit his therapist, Gail played by Catherine O'Hara.</p>

<p>While paying for his session with a massive bag of weed, Joel is offered a drink. Gail, while remaining professional (aside from the drink) laments that this is her "first birthday without [her] husband in 41 years," a statement that makes Joel tense.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=UsuKSzf4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=z9tOT-XZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>O'Hara gives an amazing performance as Gail speaks her mind about how mundane Joel's problems are. She verbalizes her internal monologue of having to say the scary things, otherwise nothing will be done about them, and then an incredible delivery of why she hates Joel, how she's tried to forgive him, but that she also knows that she can't.</p>

<p>Those who have played the game know that the rest of the season is fueled by revenge--the revenge of Abby for the climactic finale of season 1, and then the retaliatory revenge of Ellie. To have a moment in episode one of someone taking the higher road, expressing their hatred and anger at another, and accepting that you can not forgive someone but also not want to retaliate back,is a perfect way to set up just how poorly every decision from here on out will be made.</p>

<p>When Gail then asks Joel to "say the thing you're afraid to say," the camera lingers on Joel as he responds to her questions, unable to answer and reveal that the world could have been healed. Then he stands up and defiantly states, "I saved her," and walks out.</p>

<p>I had chills watching Pascal as Joel, recognizing on his face that he knows what he did was for him, and not for her… and definitely not for the world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-and-dina-dance.jpg?itok=PIFBlmuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-and-dina-dance.jpg?itok=gprejDqT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>The Last Of Us </em>Season 2 Episode 1 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There's a lot crammed into this episode. It doesn't exactly go anywhere, aside from knowing Abby's group is nearby. The plot doesn't move forward, but the episode does a great job to show where we are five years later.</p>

<p>We know where Joel and Ellie are at, we know Dina and her relationship with the major cast, and we know the plans and strategies of the settlement. We've been perfectly welcomed back into the world and caught up so that as things begin to go awry, we're ready to worry about our heroes (and villains).</p>

<p>I'm very excited for the continuation of this show. It makes sense that a game that many already described "as a movie" is being so wonderfully adapted for TV, but all of the little details and the stellar performances from the cast really elevate the show to be something not just for those who played the games, but for a wider audience.</p>

            <p>While PCs and smartphones will be exempt from Trump's retaliatory tariffs in the US, consoles will not.</p>
<p>That's according to former GamesIndustry.biz boss Chris Dring, who confirmed in his newsletter, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pcs-and-smartphones-exempt-from-trump">The Game Business</a>, that not only could Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console be impacted by the tariffs, but so too will PlayStation and Xbox's hardware.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the exemptions for other tech components like SSDs and PCs were intentionally not applied to consoles or if it's merely an oversight. On the plus side, it looks as though Nintendo Switch cartridges will be spared the extra 125% levy.</p>
<p>Nintendo had already directed the vast majority of its Switch 2 manufacturing output <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">from Vietnam towards the US over the first two months of this year</a>, as the threat of Trump's now-confirmed tariffs loomed, but the stinging tariffs applied to Vietnam - a key manufacturer for Nintendo - and China continue to cause considerable uncertainty.</p>
<p>This may also have the ripple effect of piting Asian players against US game studios.</p>
<p>"It is not far-fetched to think that even if 'a deal is struck' for tariffs and other issues between the US and China, Chinese consumers would protest the economic uncertainty by avoiding US products and even by avoiding US technology and games," said Lisa Hanson, CEO at <a href="https://nikopartners.com/nikos-opinion-on-tariffs-video-games-and-us-china-trade/">Niko Partners</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has finally opened up about its recent acquisition, assuring its staff as well as players that the tentpole franchise will "not undergo any major changes" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">Niantic was sold to Saudi-backed Monopoly Go maker Scopely as part of a $3.5bn deal</a> last month.</p>
<p>In a general all-hands meeting that united both companies last week in Japan, Niantic representatives sought to assuage concerns, insisting that Scopely bought Niantic because of the success of its games, not because it wants to change them.</p>

<p>"The direction of our game will not undergo any major changes under the influence of Scopely," a Niantic spokesperson told those at the meeting, as reported by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/mobile/articles/2504/10/news182.html">ITMedia</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-go-will-not-change-due-to-scopelys-influence-niantic-assures-following-acquisition/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"[Scopely] will just be supporting its further improvement, and we will keep doing what we've been doing since the beginning. To put it more bluntly – please rest assured that we will not be shutting down the game."</p>
<p>The Niantic exec said there was nothing else to announce at this time, but did hint that the company will continue to "evolve" Pokémon Go over time.</p>
<p>As Tom recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Pokémon Go fans had expressed deep concern over Scopely's acquisition</a> of the game, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">word of the deal leaked online</a>. The hugely-popular mobile game has over 20 million weekly active players, with an average of 40 minutes daily playtime, and is set to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Marathon - the upcoming reimagined PvP extraction shooter from the Sony-owned Bungie - will release on 23rd September, 2025, with a closed Alpha test kicking off on April 23.</p>
<p>Bungie finally revealed Marathon's release date in a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-is-finally-getting-a-reveal-this-week">lengthy teasers, all embedded below, showing off its gameplay and cinematics over the weekend</a>.</p>

<p>"Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter set around the mysterious and cutthroat world of Tau Ceti IV," the voiceover teases. "You are a Runner, a cybernetic mercenary who's given up their human form for a biosynethic shell with unique abilities and stats, capable of both tactical and fast-paced combat.</p>
<p>"Here, you'll fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You'll face rival Runners in zones of up to 18 players, countless security forces, and otherworldly threats. To scavenge the remains of a lost colony for glory and fortune."</p>
<p>There are six classes, although only four were revealed; stealthy Void, tanky Glitch, as well as Locus and Blackbird. All four will be available in the upcoming alpha test, and there's no need to race to lock in your favourite as you ready up - your team can play as three Voids if you want, as there's no limit.</p>

<p>It goes on to describe the scavengable environments of Tau Ceti IV - they're "filled with weapons, materials, and equipment" - with sponsorship from factions able to help replenish your armoury.</p>
<p>It also stresses that Marathon has been designed to play as fireteams, with contextual pings, shared objectives, and down-but-not-out mechanics, although there is the ability to opt out of crew queues if you're a lone wolf wanting to "take all the glory for yourself as a solo Runner".</p>
<p>"Before deploying, you'll strategically build your loadout and select a Runner to ensure you're equipped for the run ahead. Your objective is simple: get in, gather as much loot as you can, and make it out alive. Die, and all your gear will be up for grabs. Survive, and your loot can be taken into future runs as you grow in power and fill your vault."</p>
<p>That said, death is, apparently, "inevitable, but it's never the end".</p>

<p>"Bungie brings its best in class, first-person person multiplayer action to the forefront. Dynamic and tactile gunplay. Runners with unique playstyles and customisable builds create highly dynamic and strategic team fights."</p>
<p>Because of its timed matches, dynamic events, variable weather, and unpredictable players, Bungie reckons no two matches will be the same. There'll also be endgame challenges, ranked play, secrets, seasonal storytelling, community events, "and more" in season one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, Bungie also warns that no matter how geared up you are, "players with skill and strategy will always have the edge".</p>
<p>Marathon is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with full cross-play and cross-save.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox">you won't need a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon</a> on PC or Xbox.</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message: "Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox."</p>

<p>Marathon is set to be a game-changing extraction shooter, but it’s hard to break into a genre that’s so dominated by existing titles. For instance, Escape from Tarkov has held the top spot in that vertical for many years, and those that have tried to challenge the game have ultimately failed or fallen to the wayside.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon will attempt to rival the likes of Escape from Tarkov by <strong>not </strong>rivalling Escape from Tarkov. That’s straight from the mouth of the game’s director, Joe Ziegler, who recently sat down with Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky to discuss all aspects of the upcoming shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-interesting-stories">‘The Most Interesting Stories’</h2>



<p>Joe Ziegler was transparent when talking to Jake Lucky about Marathon following a recent behind-closed-doors playtest. He suggested that the reason why extraction shooters fail is because they come in and worry about competing with other, existing titles – but it’s all about trying to be <strong>different enough </strong>to live alongside those top dogs.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon TELL ALL with Bungie's Joe Ziegler" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTSnXKDpQvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In another recent interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt</a> explained that trying to replicate the success of a game like Escape from Tarkov will always be fruitless because people don’t want to play the same game over and over again.</p>



<p>That’s what Ziegler alluded to in his interview with Jake Lucky:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might be naive in saying this but I’ll be honest… To me, I don’t think of making games as like, directly competing and trying to eat a bunch of other people’s lunch. For me, whenever I think about it, it’s like, how do we offer something that’s interesting and cool and can live in its own space alongside other titles and be just as big and important as others.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, Bungie has worked from a variety of perspectives to make Marathon as unique as possible.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We really do want to create some of the most interesting stories you’ve ever had, and we’re inputting a lot of dynamics to make that happen. At the end of a night of playing Marathon, we want you to tell a really cool story to somebody else, you know? To be excited.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is also making Marathon the most accessible extraction shooter in the market, doing away with punishing mechanics and a steep learning curve to make something that everyone can play and enjoy. They’re hellbent on ‘breaking the already existing military space’ and making something much more adventurous in Marathon.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon can exist happily alongside a dominant extraction shooter like Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments what you think, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Throughout history and, unfortunately, right up to the present day, the world has thousands of examples of tyranny and oppression, where powerful groups use their influences to exert force over smaller or less powerful groups. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-review/">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a> may not seem like the first port of call when considering this topic, but its story does touch upon the elements of tyranny, oppression, and resistance. The points this essay will touch upon include the use of military against a peaceful nation, the kidnapping of a group of people, those being the Gobbos, Baron Dante’s tyrannical actions, and Croc’s actions as a resistance fighter and liberator.</p>
<h2>Baron Dante’s Tyranny</h2>
<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos starts with the Gobbos taking in an abandoned baby Croc, raising him as one of their own. From what we see in the opening moments, the Gobbos are a peaceful society that work together to maintain a homeland where everyone is treated with respect, kindness, and supported. There seems to be no conflict within Gobbo society, nor does this society come across a warmongering. In fact, they seem almost childlike and naïve to the dangers of the wider world around them with barely any preparedness when having an aggressor as a neighbour. The most basic of plans seem to revolve around Croc saving them, but if he fails then Gobbo society goes extinct.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Remaster OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CBD8kgxlDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Completely unexpectedly, at least to the Gobbos, Baron Dante launches an invasion of the Gobbo homeland with his Dantini military at his side. Such is the ferocity of the attack, the Gobbos lose their homes as the Dantini army begin destroying everything. Moments before all the Gobbos are captured, King Gobbo manages to help Croc escape, giving a slither of hope in these dark times.</p>
<p>Post invasion, Baron Dante appears to order that each Gobbo is isolated away from their kin, with everyone thrown in their own cage, box, or used as a prize in mini games with only a brief shot of escape. Here, we can draw out that Baron Dante had no care for Gobbo society and what it stood for, was fine with separating families and putting his Gobbo prisoners in solitary confinement. To further exacerbate this, each Gobbo is imprisoned in areas that have no basic facilities, instead placed in some incredibly dangerous areas that could end up fatal for them. The minigames beg the question that if Croc did not win them, were these Gobbos to be prizes for those invited to take part, and trafficked away with their families never knowing what happened to them?</p>


<p>Baron Dante’s oppression and tyranny is not just saved for the Gobbos. Through the game we see that he does not respect the free will of most other creatures. As Croc makes progress in his liberation mission, Baron Dante uses his power to turn innocent creatures into unwilling combatants within his army, forcing them to fight Croc. These individuals do get hurt in their battles but if they fail they are left to carry on with their lives. They regain their freedom but it shows that Baron Dante has no duty of responsibility towards these drafted soldiers, leaving them to their fates.</p>
<h2>Croc As A Leader of Resistance</h2>
<p>Most that become symbols of resistance do not necessarily choose to become such symbols but are forced to through the events that occur around them. Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela, Bhagat Singh, Tiananmen Square’s Tank man, Harriet Tubman, Volodymyr Zelensky. These are just some notable figures who have stood up to either lead resistance against more powerful adversaries or become symbols of resistance themselves. Croc is an individual that is forced to act in his own world against a member of the royalty in Baron Dante and all of the resources available to him. This is another showdown between a focused yet disadvantaged person taking on a complex power structure to force a change for the better.</p>
<p>Croc is outnumbered with no allies except Beany, who can teleport Croc to new areas. No one else takes up the cause to free the Gobbos from their prison. This could be down to several reasons. First, there’s a clear lack of information available to anyone else who otherwise would have helped. Baron Dante would tightly control any message from the region, and the invasion of the Gobbos is something he may not have publicised. Second could be fear. It could be other groups have heard of the invasion and displacement of the Gobbos, but do not act out of fear that Baron Dante will turn his forces against them. Third, any other resistance has already been dealt with. We do not know the full history of the region, but Baron Dante may have already crushed other resistances that were rising up giving him free reign over his part of the land.</p>

<p>Croc is essentially a guerrilla fighter, striking at targets quickly to free up his Gobbo family from their prisons before quickly moving to the next area. While the path that he can take is quite predictable, he is not at first seen of as much of a threat with very little of the Dantini military standing in his way at the start. However, as Croc marches onwards and dispatches foes Baron Dante increase security to protect himself. Croc shows very little mercy to those who get in his way, engaging in close quarters combat to fight against the oppressors. This showcases how little in the way of resources Croc has as he has not even armed himself with a weapon, and even if he was it is unlikely he would know how to use it having been raised by the Gobbos.</p>
<p>After facing the trials of navigating hostile environments, and fighting willing and unwilling enemy soldiers, Croc eventually confronts Baron Dante having freed the Gobbos and dismantled much of Baron Dante’s power structure. Croc successfully overthrows Baron Dante and takes his people back to their homeland, with the world around them once again thriving. While this is a good ending for the Croc and Gobbos, it leaves behind another land where there is no one in charge which paves the way for a power struggle and further strife that will impact the Gobbos again. Filling that vacuum is not Croc’s responsibility, but this does show that even successful resistance movements can lead to unintended consequences.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos is a game that on its surface looks like a standard, colourful, and innocent platformer. What this essay has outlined is that Croc: Legend of the Gobbos actually tells a story of oppression, tyranny, forced displacement, the imbalance of power, and the need for resistance against tyranny. If there is no resistance then the majority of victims will be the innocent, like the childlike and naïve Gobbos. Croc is an unexpected symbol of resistance but his actions show that even one person with the necessary drive can bring about change for the better in an unjust world.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-%E2%80%98social-extraction-experience%E2%80%99-but-the-game-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-proximity-chat.1163091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will not have proximity chat despite the developers wanting the game to be a ‘social extraction experience’.</p>



<p>The news of no proximity chat came via a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/marathon-wont-have-proximity-chat-because-itd-be-way-too-toxic-i-dont-think-anyone-has-a-good-solution-to-that-just-yet/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, game director Joe Ziegler told PC Gamer that they don’t “have a solution yet” when it comes to the toxicity that proximity chat brings to players.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone really has a good solution to that just yet. Because we’re so dedicated to making sure that we’re creating a safe space where we don’t have players just flaming each other or doing terrible things to one another, I think we’re not ready to invest in prox chat until we have a solution,” he said.</p>







<p>The comments come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following an interview that we published in collaboration with Jake Lucky</a>, where in the same day of interviews Joe Ziegler told Lucky that they want the game to be “more of a social extraction experience”.</p>



<p>Ziegler explained, “The key thing for us was making Marathon a little bit more of a social extraction experience where there’s a lot value in playing with other people that you know or people that you want and you all feel like you can create that adventure together and we’re not trying to fragment you all the time, you know?”</p>



<p>In the interview, Ziegler gave the example of being able to be respawned instead of just watching your teammates complete the match, or another example of “data cards” where your entire team can cash them out together.</p>



<p>However, I think a <strong>big point</strong> is being missed here and the conflicting comments are a bit of a head scratcher. Proximity chat ADDS the much-needed social aspect to a game and while I understand Bungie’s stance on toxicity, surely players who don’t want to engage with proximity chat can just… you know… turn it off? Or better yet, just give players the ability to report others for toxicity. These are not new ideas and with the right infrastructure (moderation), they are the solution that Bungie is looking for.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you’re never going to stop people from being toxic, no matter what you do.</p>



<p>Without proximity chat, Bungie is missing the mark entirely on not only what makes extraction shooters fun and exciting and to be honest… Makes the whole ‘social extractions shooter’ comment laughable.</p>



<p>Marathon is set to be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on September 23, 2025.</p>
