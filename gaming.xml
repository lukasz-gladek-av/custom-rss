Nearly two decades later, however, it appears that Helmsley may have been ahead of the curve when it comes to pet inheritances.</p><p>“The legal system is only recently catching up to the fact that animals have legal interests,” Christopher Berry, managing attorney for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, told the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2023/12/06/pets-trust-estate-planning/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2023/12/06/pets-trust-estate-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a></span>. “But to take advantage of this development, people should engage in some planning to provide care for their companion animals.”</p><p>While animals cannot legally inherit money, it is becoming increasingly common for individuals to carve out provisions in their wills for their furry (or feathery or scaly) family members. Some people, like Helmsley, choose to leave money in pet trusts that provide for the animal’s care after their owners’ deaths. The idea may seem eccentric on its face, but some experts emphasize that it’s really no different than any other kind of money left in a trust.</p><p>“All 50 states recognize some form of a pet trust, thanks, in part, to the Uniform Trust Code, which has a provision recognizing and enforcing pet trusts,” Berry told the Washington Post.</p><p>Like with human cases, when a (furry) beneficiary of a trust dies, it’s up to the trustee to follow the next steps - whether that’s dissolving the trust or following instructions on where to distribute the funds.</p><p>It is also becoming increasingly common for people to explicitly state where they want their pets to live – in an effort to avoid family disputes and ensure animals don’t end up in shelters.</p><p>Experts recommend creating explicit provisions about wills during estate planning to ensure the animal doesn’t languish for months or even years, while humans work out their ownership disputes.</p><p>“Most people think that their family members will do the right thing and care for these animals, but our experience shows it’s just not true,” Eldad Hagar, co-founder of the Los Angeles pet rescue charity Hope for Paws, told the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/you-love-your-dog-should-she-be-in-your-will-a2af9b04?mod=lifestyle_lead_pos4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/you-love-your-dog-should-she-be-in-your-will-a2af9b04?mod=lifestyle_lead_pos4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a></span>. “So many times they end up at the shelter to be euthanized.”</p><p>Continue reading to learn more about animals who received inheritances from their owners.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ff9b3ed5685f0962435b2b980b891667" data-recommend-id="image://ff9b3ed5685f0962435b2b980b891667" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="683" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Choupette is pictured on the LucyBalu stand during the LucyBalu Product Presentation at Paris Nord Villepinte on September 09, 2022 in Paris, France.</figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Julien M.

The blue-cream Birman cat made such a mark on pop culture that both Doja Cat and Jared Leto wore Choupette-inspired costumes to the 2023 Met Gala. Lagerfeld made it clear that he would leave part of his fortune to Choupette – referring to her as a “little heiress.” While it’s unclear exactly how much she inherited, Choupette was already independently a millionaire from her life as a kitty-influencer.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-recommend-id="image://b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="2121" data-height="1414" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty/istock" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Leslie Ann Mandel left $100,000 to her cockatiels (not pictured)</figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->yellowsarah<!-- --> (<!-- -->iStock by Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-recommend-id="image://b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="2121" data-height="1414" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After her 2015 death, Manhattan entrepreneur Leslie Ann Mandel left $100,000 to her 32 cockatiels, along with a request that the birds continue to reside in her Hamptons home.

Posner’s son disputed the will in court, arguing that his mother was taken advantage of by her staff while she was dying. He also alleged that staff members convinced his mother to push a media narrative that her chihuahua, Conchita, was spoiled, in an effort to justify leaving a fortune to her pets.<br></p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Quartz, our sister site, on Monday, August 12.</em></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Video game actors are calling for better transparency around "disgusting" motion capture work that is not properly disclosed at the point of booking.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23l4ml51jmo">BBC</a>, professional casting director Jessica Jefferies - who previously worked as a motion capture performer - recalled times she'd be called for a shoot with absolutely no information about what the work entailed, only to find out that it included "gratuitous" sex scenes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that the intimate scene from Baldur's Gate 3 above is in no way implicated in this story, and included because Larian Studios took the positive step of using intimacy coordinators during development</strong></em>.</p>
<p>"We'd get an email or a call from a studio saying we need you on these days for a shoot," she explained. "That was all the information we'd get.</p>
<p>"I turned up and was told what I would be filming would be a graphic rape scene. This act could be watched for as long or as little time as the player wanted through a window, and then a player would be able to shoot this character in the head.</p>
<p>"It was just purely gratuitous, in my opinion."</p>
<p>Jefferies says that even though there's no nudity due to the motion capture suits worn, "it's still an act and there's an intimacy in that act, and also a violence in this situation".</p>
<p>"You are still there and still having to truly immerse yourself in this scene," she added.</p>
<p>A different actor who chose to remain anonymous said she "absolutely loves the industry", but also calls for better disclosures ahead of time, especially as actors "have to sign NDAs" and are "told almost nothing" ahead of filming.</p>
<p>"In one recording for a major game she first learned it was explicit only when she turned up for work. This was actually a full-on sex scene," she said.</p>
<p>"I had to [vocally] match the scene and through the glass in the booth with the entire team, all male, watching me. It was excruciating... at that stage I had been in the games industry a while, and I had never felt so shaken.</p>
<p>"What upset me so much about the situation is I was put on the spot, nobody thought to ask me if I was okay with it, and nobody checked to see if I was okay afterwards," she added.</p>
<p>The UK's games industry trade body, Ukie, did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.</p>
<p>However, in relation to guidelines drawn up by the British Actors Union, Equity, the organisation said its focus "remains on fostering a supportive environment for all stakeholders in the UK video game sector, ensuring it remains the best place to create, play, and sell video games".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-romantic-scenes-used-intimacy-coordinators">hired intimacy coordinators</a> to ensure its actors felt safe and comfortable during romantic scenes.</p>
<p>In an earlier interview with BBC, actor Devora Wilde - who plays githyanki warrior Lae'zel in the critically-acclaimed release - said she was pleased with Larian's decision to do so.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/17/do-your-own-stunts-in-action-hero-for-meta-quest-2-3/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Fast Travel Games has revealed Action Hero for Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro, an action-packed FPS that will throw you onto movie sets to battle ninjas, punch dinosaurs, and race along speeding trains.</p>
<p><iframe title="Action Hero | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCmf6caZIHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay seems to take a leaf out of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/07/19/superhot-vr-review/">Superhot VR’s book</a>, with everything happening in slow motion and then only speeding up as you, the player, physically move. It’s a clever way of helping to make things more manageable, and will no doubt be a pretty cool effect in this setting.</p>
<p>Action Hero will present you with five different movies to play through – so there’s no need for Fast Travel to concoct a story to explain how ninjas and dinosaurs are coexisting, as fun as that might be.</p>
<p>It’s coming soon exclusively for Meta Quest 2 and newer, which will no doubt be a bit of a disappointment for PSVR 2 diehards and PC VR enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The studio had a bunch of other announcements during the VR Games Showcase this week, confirming that they’re bringing CM Games’ Into The Radius to PSVR 2 next month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Into The Radius | PS VR2 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dNtBCybOrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They’re also bringing their hide-and-seek shooter Mannequin out of Early Access, with a full launch on Quest 3 and PC VR on 12th September.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mannequin | Official Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dH7GXeXfH4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And they’ll publish Smartmelon Games’ Rock Band-alike VR game Band Space later this year for Quest and PC VR.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Band Space | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOqJgnAfzeM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

		<p>Devolver Digital and developer All Possible Futures have&nbsp;<em>finally</em> announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-plucky-squire">The Plucky Squire</a>. This charming adventure will launch on 17th September for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, Nintendo Switch and PC. Oh, and it will be available day one via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Plucky Squire | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DpvZWrts_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The plucky Squire tells the story of Joy and his friends, who have to save the lands from the evil Humgrump in a page-turning action adventure storybook. However, with his demise inevitable, Humgrump casts a last ditch magical spell that tears through the fabric of the bookish world and kicks Jot out into the 3D world around it.</p>
<p>Now Jot will have to adventure between multiple worlds, battling through the 3D world and hopping into 2D spaces that could be the pages of a book, the side of a coffee mug, and plenty more. He’ll pick up new abilities on the way, such as grabbing a jetpack, and fight against all manner of foes, like getting into a boxing fight with a badger, or use a newfound bow and arrow to defeat a ranged enemy.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention to Devolver Digital for the last few years, you might recognise the art style of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/21/swords-of-ditto-mormos-curse-switch-review-update/">The Swords of Ditto</a> in the 2D segments, and there’s a very good reason for that. This game is coming from Bidds, who’s now no longer of One Bit Beyond fame, but a part of All Possible Futures alongside former Pokémon designer James Turner.</p>

<p>We got to play the game at Gamescom last year, with Dom saying, “The Plucky Squire takes a few lines from The Legend of Zelda, a paragraph or two from Mario, and borrows a couple of footnotes from Pixar, but its clear that All Possible Futures are writing their own story. Based on Gamescom 2023, it’s heading straight to the top of the bestsellers list.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-shows-pc-features-in-new-trailer.955731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-shows-pc-features-in-new-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With Star Wars Outlaws just a couple of weeks away from launch, Ubisoft has shared a new official PC gameplay trailer that shows off the main features of this version. Most of them have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented </a>with the help of NVIDIA, starting with RTX Direct Illumination. In the comparison below, we can see that ground details are much more noticeable when RTXDI is enabled.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SWO-RTXDI-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The game also supports ray traced global illumination and ray traced reflections. On GeForce RTX GPUs, the quality of all ray traced effects is heightened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a>, also known as Ray Reconstruction. As we already saw when the technology was first introduced in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, reflections in particular are much sharper when Ray Reconstruction is enabled, and Star Wars Outlaws follows the same rule.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SWO-RR-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, to achieve maximum performance, Star Wars Outlaws supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. In the trailer, we get a brief glimpse of the frame rate when both are activated. This looks like a cantina space with quite a few NPCs around, and the frame rate is hovering around 110 FPS. Of course, being an open world game, the frame rate might well be lower in other areas. Moreover, this was likely captured on the most powerful GPU currently on the market, the GeForce RTX 4090. Last but not least, NVIDIA Reflex is also supported.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SWO-FG-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the CPU front, the game has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-intel-cpu-launch-partner-star-wars-outlaws-14th-gen-optimizations-game-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimized</a> for Intel 14th Generation processors, offering 'CPU scaling performance optimizations'. A game bundle was available from April to July 31; those who took advantage of the offer, purchasing a new processor from eligible retailers, will get a free code ahead of launch.</p>

<p>The PC system requirements were <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a couple of weeks ago by Ubisoft, but you can check them quickly in the infographic below. In case you don't meet the system requirements, there's always the cloud streaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-star-wars-outlaws-visions-of-mana-and-more-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">option</a> via GeForce NOW.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GVIAtRrWgAAVgpd-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws is out on August 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Ubisoft recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the post-launch roadmap, which includes two story pack expansions, Wild Card (due in Fall 2024) and A Pirate's Fortune (slated in Spring 2025).

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wukong-gameplay-leak-video/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/30-minutes-of-black-myth-wukong-gameplay-leaks-online.955719/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wukong-gameplay-leak-video/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is set to be released next week, and the leaks have already started showing. Most recently, a 30-minute gameplay video was uploaded to YouTube, showing an early boss fight sequence and some live exploration of the upcoming action-rich game. For as long as it stays up and online, you can check it out below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-than-average">Bigger Than Average</h2>



<p>The Black Myth: Wukong leaked gameplay video unfolds with the player going through an intense boss fight – but it’s mostly cinematic-based. In the first few minutes of the video, we see the protagonist, who is based on the ancient Chinese character ‘Sun Wukong’, fighting enormous enemies, all of whom are effectively kicking the snot out of him.</p>



<p>In one scene, one of them summons a gargantuan axe that’s powerful enough to cleave a mountain in half.</p>



<p>Once that’s over and done with, the character’s setting pivots (following more cutscenes), and the player is pulled into more of a tutorial setting. Over the next fifteen minutes, the story unravels as the player is tasked with fighting more low-level enemies in a dense forest punctuated with ancient ruins.</p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong _ Wukong vs Yang Jian (Erlang Shen) fight _ Gameplay Leak" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ALlQXqELb5Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There are some obvious time skips, which allow for some of the most interesting enemies in the game to be shown, such as a humanoid enemy with an enormous head standing as tall as a house.</p>



<p>It looks good – the combat isn’t anything too innovative, but it looks well-built and challenging, which is what people will expect coming into this game. The visuals are stunning and the cutscenes are cinematic enough to keep players engaged and immersed in the story.</p>



<p>Are you going to be picking up Black Myth: Wukong next week?</p>

Joe/Transformers crossover movie starring Chris Hemsworth.</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog producer Toru Nakahara will produce Eternal Champions for Sega, while David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger will serve as producers on behalf of Skydance.

It will presumably try to capture some of the appeal of the Mortal Kombat films, which draw from a similar time period in gaming history and remain nostalgic favorites.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Biggest Movies Coming in 2024</h3></div></output><p>Aside from Eternal Champions, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/upcoming-video-game-movies-and-tv-shows">other games getting their own movies</a> include The Legend of Zelda, Death Stranding, and Until Dawn, among others. Releases like Sega's own Sonic movies have been a financial boon for Hollywood, but the trend is not without its risks. Borderlands, which released last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">was critically panned</a> and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-ceo-borderlands-movie-backlash-poor-box-office-results-response">major bust at the box office</a>.</p><p>We'll see how Eternal Champions does when it eventually makes its way to theatres. It does not yet have a release date.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

                <p>It's our favorite time of the year and not <em>just</em> because temperatures are finally starting to cool down. It's Gamecom time, folks!</p><p>If the dozens of fantastic games launching over the course of the next few months weren't enough to look forward to, brace yourselves for a whole lot of announcements, reveals, and deep dives courtesy of the Germany-based video game trade show. In this episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss what games they are most excited to see on the show floor, as well as what they suspect Opening Night Live has in store for us. From <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>, to more niche titles like the aptly named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun/" data-ref-id="5000-567899">Squirrel With A Gun</a>, there's a lot to chat about and even more to get excited for. Here's a quick overview of the content you can expect to see from GameSpot in the coming weeks, as well as plenty of titles to add to your ever-growing "want to play" list.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdOO0LQgKIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PdOO0LQgKIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

We’re certain there’s something here for you.</p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Steam<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Solve an old-fashioned mystery</p><p>A few weeks ago, I mentioned how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-star-wars-final-fantasy-hinterberg-1851612307/slides/5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-star-wars-final-fantasy-hinterberg-1851612307/slides/5">I was captivated by <em>Unavowed</em></a></span>, a point-and-click adventure from the folks at Wadjet Eye. Well, I’ve finished that one (it was great) just in time for a brand-new entry in the genre to come along. And while Wadjet Eye’s output is most reminiscent of ‘90s adventure games that offered full voice acting and elegant drag-and-drop interfaces, this new game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></a></span><em> </em>from designer Julia Minamata, is influenced by an earlier era of adventures, ones that ran in EGA and had you typing in what you wanted your character to do. I can’t wait to explore its mysteries.</p><p><em>The Crimson Diamond </em>is perhaps most reminiscent of Sierra adventures, especially the Clara Bow games which saw their plucky heroine tossed into murder mysteries during the roaring ‘20s. It<em> </em>casts you as Nancy Maple, a young woman investigating the discovery of an unusually large and valuable diamond in a town in northern Ontario, Canada. It’s clear from the trailer that her investigations will find her encountering people with motives of their own, some of them sinister, and land her in no small amount of peril. Sign me up!</p><p>People often talk about the evolution of adventure games from text parsers to purely graphical interfaces as a net good, as if text parsers were just a crutch, a relic from the genre’s early days that we no longer needed, but I’ve always thought of them as two fundamentally different approaches, each with their own strengths. I think there are ways in which the presence of a text parser can encourage creative thinking that a purely graphics-based interface doesn’t always allow for, and in addition to digging into the plot of <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, I’m eager to see how it uses this design element that so rarely gets employed in modern games. All in all, it sounds like a perfect fit for a cozy weekend. —<strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC (early access)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>See if this <em>Stardew Valley </em>competitor has got chops</p><p>I keep hearing about this freaking game, so I think it’s time I just play it. I’m not really one to play a farming game—having bounced off of <em>Stardew Valley </em>a number of times despite enjoying myself—but maybe <em>Fields of Mistria</em> will be the one that makes me stick with the genre. I think if it manages that feat, it’ll be because of the strength of its gameplay and art style. I’ve grown a bit tired of the pixelated look of games like <em>Stardew</em>, which certainly hasn’t helped its case, but I also never really loved the loop of it either. It isn’t that it feels bad, but rather that it feels uneven. Farming appropriately feels like busywork, and I’ve been hooked by its fishing mini-game, but whenever I had to go into the mines to dig and get into some combat, it felt shallow.</p><p>That doesn’t appear to be the case for <em>Fields of Mistria</em>, which looks to boast more in the way of tailored dungeons and involved combat mechanics. Aesthetically and mechanically, it seems way closer to a classic <em>Zelda </em>title, and that’s doing a lot to muster excitement from me. Now, if I can just make it to the point where the daily rhythm of activities feels like second nature, I might just find the first cozy farming game outside of <em>Animal Crossing </em>to make a lasting impression. —<strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Steam<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Write another story</p><p>When we put together these Kotaku Weekend Guides, typically I try to write something I’m currently playing or have at least played recently. This time, I went looking through my Steam library for a game to recommend, and Worldwalker Games’ <em>Wildermyth</em> caught my eye. The tactics RPG was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wildermyth-s-incredible-dynamic-storytelling-is-giving-1847593466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wildermyth-s-incredible-dynamic-storytelling-is-giving-1847593466">one of the best games to come out in 2021</a></span>. It lets you create a party of heroes and play through branching campaigns, all with excellent writing and interesting spins on fantasy combat mechanics. I only played through one campaign in 2021, but I have a lot of fond memories of playing as my mage Kenjamin Shepardson and using the magic system that’s more akin to an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> bending than your usual spellcasting system, requiring you to manipulate the elements in the environment. Those made each battle compelling, but the attachment I had to my custom party made the stakes feel incredibly high. <em>Wildermyth</em>’s storytelling is its greatest strength, and its ability to let you nudge the story in drastically different directions while building your party’s relationships is still head and shoulders above games with 10 times the budget. It’s finally coming to consoles on October 22, but the PC version is exceptional and well worth your time. —<strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC <br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Make it to September</p><p>I like Atlus RPGs in general and enjoy the <em>Persona</em> games in particular. I began with <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> on Vita, played a bit of <em>Persona 2: Innocent Sin</em> on the PSP, and poured about 20 hours into <em>Persona 5</em> on the PS4. They’re all great games and I liked them just fine, but none pulled me in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927">like <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> has</a></span>. I’d be lying if I said I knew exactly why that is. </p><p>Maybe it’s the modern graphics and old-school design sensibility hitting a sweet spot in my nostalgia, like I’m experiencing a lost game from the late aughts that I always wanted to play but never got to. Or it could be that the more melancholy, blue-tinted mashup of chill vibes and menacing macabre undertones is more my style than the other <em>Persona</em> games. I even find grinding the endless procedural dungeons oddly satisfying, giving me a modicum of exploration, progression, and jazzy combat without making me feel like a mouse being led through a laborious maze in search of an old bit of moldy cheese.</p><p>I can sit down at the end of a long day, turn the lights off, get in, vibe out, and then cut loose after just a few days have passed on the social calendar. It helps that the soundtrack is top notch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486">The epilogue DLC is out in just a month</a></span>. I probably won’t be done in time, which is fine. I’m in no rush.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-phones-eu<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, after years of legal battles and regulatory drama, some people can play <em>Fortnite</em> on their phones again via Epic’s newly-launched mobile Epic Games Store. It’s not available in all areas on all devices, but if you’re a global Android user or an iPhone user in the EU, you can jump through a whole mess of hoops to shotgun someone while <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-fortnite-d23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dressed</a> as a banana dressed as Wolverine.</p><p>All of this began <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost exactly four years ago</a>, when Epic launched its own payment systems for <em>Fortnite</em> on mobile devices in August 2020. Epic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly lost</a> the ensuing court battle with Apple, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/epic-wins-google-case-which-i-did-not-see-coming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won against Google</a>. Apple has been <a href="https://aftermath.site/apples-new-app-store-policy-is-petty-as-hell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dragging its heels</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216181/apple-eu-app-store-services-fee-external-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throwing wrenches in the works</a> since, but today Epic has gotten some of what it wanted in the form of its mobile store. I’m tempted to roll my eyes at all this, feeling a bit permanently poisoned by Epic’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-about-this-sucks-1844720017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibes</a> around the whole thing, but it’s actually a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/16/fornite-mobile-ios-android-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty big deal</a>: increased anti-trust attention on these big companies and their store policies has highlighted the ways their iron grip harms both developers and players, and loosening that grip is inarguably a good thing.</p><p>But to actually install the mobile Epic Games Store and play <em>Fortnite</em>, as well as mobile versions of Epic-owned <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>, you’ll need to click through several settings menus and ignore multiple warnings. There are so many steps that Epic has made videos explaining it, in which you can practically hear the narrator sighing in frustration as they say “There are a lot of steps, and we’re here to help.”</p><p>Here’s the Android instructions:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Learn How to Install the Epic Games Store on Android" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4C4RxVF-unI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the nearly two minute video, Epic explains that first “you’ll get a popup saying the file might be harmful, which isn’t true,” so you should select “download anyway.” Then, before the store starts installing, “you’ll probably see a security notice saying your phone isn’t allowed to install apps from this source,” which you’ll have to change in settings and agree to a confirmation. You’ll get <em>another</em> source-related popup once you’ve downloaded the store and want to install your first game from it, which requires a trip <em>back</em> to settings and <em>another</em> confirmation. “Whew, we did it!” declares the narrator, before noting that Epic is working on making this process easier in the future, alongside “regulators around the world.”</p><p>The installation process is slightly less messy on EU iPhones, but not by much, though the iOS video is 12 seconds shorter than the Android one. And none of it is as seamless or confidence-inspiring as just installing an app from the big stores that you're probably used to.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Learn How to Install the Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6cmu0NuM3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Is some average parent going to power through all this, wading through the intimidating warnings and extra confirmations, just to give their kid <em>Fortnite</em>? If their kid insists enough, and shows their parent these videos, and repeatedly assures them the mobile EGS isn't just spam designed to steal their credit card information, maybe. But in this age of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/scams-phishing-robocalls-facebook-marketplace-291255fc54f4bef161cb6155af562d96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased online scams</a>, I wouldn’t fault anyone not up to date on this whole saga for giving up. Epic’s decision to make tutorials is a good idea, and especially to make them so staid, clearly aimed at adults with phones and not young <em>Fortnite</em> players.&nbsp;It’s wild to me how complicated this whole process is, and I’ll be curious to see if it has a demonstrable consequence of keeping people away from alternate app stores.</p><p> But Epic seems determined to stay the course: In his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-apple-google-fortnite-eu-tim-sweeney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File</a> newsletter today, our old boss Stephen has Tim Sweeney saying that</p><blockquote><p>it might well be a billion dollars of lost revenue in four years of <em>Fortnite</em> being off the iOS App Store…</p><p>And there's really no price that isn't worth paying for freedom, for all developers and the future of gaming…. if we spent a billion dollars so far, that's a small price to pay for the future freedom of our company and of all of the others who want to participate in the market.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Sweeney goes on to say</p><blockquote><p>The entire game industry is in a suppressed state, compared to what it would be if there were a free and open competition among stores. Developers would make a lot more money. Developers would lower the prices because the profit-maximizing price is actually quite a bit lower than the current price…&nbsp;</p><p>So we regard the mobile gaming business as largely broken. As evidence to that, look at the dearth of awesome games that are at the top of the charts and look at UA [user acquisition] arbitrage that's leading to casino games and super greedy pay-to-win and loot box-type games being in all the leading categories. That’s a result of the dysfunction that arises from the many forms of malpractice of the App Store practices: the taxes, but also the marketing and promotional strategies and the data strategies and so on.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>While I’m not sure I believe in the benevolent hand of the free market, Sweeney isn’t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbreaking:_The_Worst_Person_You_Know_Just_Made_A_Great_Point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">essentially wrong</a> here. I have to give Epic some grudging respect for continuing to pursue all this, though I’d rather that billion dollars have gone to keep Epic staff from <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their jobs</a>.</p><p>Epic has an extra carrot to dangle today to encourage a baffled parent through these hoops. Alongside the mobile store, <em>Fortnite</em>’s new season launches today; it’s <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel themed</a>, just as it was in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 2020</a>, shortly after <em>Fortnite</em> was first taken off phones.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-ttrpg-starter-set-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>While many folks are currently out exploring the beaches and tropical forests of Tural in Final Fantasy XIV’s latest expansion, Dawntrail, other folks have been able to dip their toes into and explore the world of Eorzea on their tabletop, thanks to Final Fantasy XIV TTRPG (referred to simply as FF14 going forward).</p><div catalogid="8b8fd096-0582-4aac-8265-f08d5ed75a93" id="206135"><div id="206135" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Final Fantasy TTRPG Starter Set</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $59.99 USD</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 3-5 (Recommended for 5 players)</li><li><strong>Playtime</strong>: 120+ min.</li><li><strong>Ages</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong>Box dimensions</strong>: 12.20 in x 8.70 in x 1.97 in</li></ul><p>To level set expectations, I want to make clear that this Starter Set offers a narrow look at only a small aspect of the experience that this RPG system features – how combat works and the narrative flow (i.e. how skill checks work). Nearly all customization aspects and systems are still a mystery and won’t be explained here. </p><p>Contained in the set is everything you and up to four friends need to complete the included three scenarios: four premade characters (two DPS, one Tank, and one Healer), a player book, a game master book, and all the required maps, tokens, and do-dads needed to complete the scenarios. </p><p>FF14 follows the general flow that all tabletop RPGs do, where the players tell the Gamemaster their idea, and the GM has them roll a die to see how well they do in their endeavor, all culminating in the outcome of their actions. Occasionally, players will find themselves in combat, which introduces certain abilities or skills tied to the individual’s character’s class that they can use to dispatch their foes, and also involves rolling dice. You can expect a good bit of hilarity, with plans crumbling in the first few moments, and things just spiraling out of control, but those moments are also part of the charm and magic of these games. These will eventually lead to some amazing memories for you and your friends, so just enjoy the ride.</p><p>For players of other popular tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder or Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there are a lot of similarities in how combat and skill checks play out in FF14. Dice rolls are focused around the use of a D20 – a 20-side dice – to determine if you succeed in something and how well you do. Having an advantage or disadvantage in a situation causes you to roll two dice and take the higher/lower of the two, critical hits when you roll a 20 – it all feels familiar and comfortable to play (as a longtime D&amp;D player). That isn’t too say that FF14 is a carbon copy, as it still does tweak and adjust some mechanics that impressed me, and made it all feel like its own game as opposed to just a D&amp;D clone with a Final Fantasy paint job. </p><p>From a quick glance through the four characters included in the set, Square Enix has put the work into trying to incorporate mainstay systems from the MMO here into the tabletop experience. For players coming over from the digital game, you will notice familiar terms and concepts for each class and role. The Black Mage gains bonuses if they cast spells of the same element concurrently (such as dealing additional damage with fire spells thanks to their Astral Fire trait), or the Warrior has attacks that combo into another, letting them attack multiple times in a single round. And the incredibly powerful Limit Break attacks also make an appearance that can turn the tide of a tough encounter if used at a pivotal time. </p><p>The aspect that I found myself most enjoying was the “Direct Hit” mechanic for attacks. In place of rolling to see if you hit at all, FF14 instead adopts the idea where you always, at minimum, hit a target, but if you roll and manage to meet or exceed the target’s physical or magical defense value, it's considered a “Direct Hit.” These “Direct Hits” can cause additional damage or effects to trigger. </p><p>Take the Warrior’s “Overpower” primary ability as an example. The base effect of the skill causes enemies that don’t target the warrior to take a penalty should they attack anyone except the warrior. However, if you manage to succeed in the attack and score a Direct Hit, Overpower additionally deals 2 damage to all targets. One of the most soul-crushing things in a TTRPG is to plan some cool attack out in your head, line everything up, and then have it all come crashing down around you as you roll poorly and not only miss out on that cool moment but also risking missing out on that turn, period. I love removing “missing” with an attack, not worrying about losing out on a turn, and not helping my team. </p><p>Where this starter set stumbles (and stumbles pretty hard actually) is in just how little of the actual system you get a peak at with this kit – which is a shame because what they do show is pretty neat. If you’re hoping to find out how to level up your character and gain new abilities, you won’t find it here – take three character sheets of the same character at three different levels instead. Or how about a look at how the equipment works? Won’t find even a spot on the included sheets for that. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This starter set has to serve as both your start and end points with your time with the game.</p></div><p>Class changing, non-combat jobs, character creation, specifics on racial bonuses, and the list goes on for parts of this system that remain in a mystery, but all of this wouldn’t be as big of a deal if the set had been released alongside the core player and GM books. Instead, this starter set was released isolated from any other release, meaning that all those questions remain unanswered. </p><p>And if playing this set sparks your interest, you have to wait to keep playing with only a “Coming Soon” to take comfort in. Some sites, such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/3dNpE?object_uuid=f50703fd-4cf9-4c9e-8c95-7646c4472dff&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>BigBadToyStore</u></a>, have a preorder page with “March 2025” listed for the Standard Handbook, meaning players may still have a good bit of time yet to wait. Without the availability of those core rule books to then continue your adventures, that means that for the foreseeable future, this starter set has to serve as both your start and end points with your time with the game, and there simply is not enough “stuff” in this set to meet those needs.</p><p>These issues are all capped off with the relatively high price tag of $59.99 on Square’s store page – a price that is nearly triple that of other TTRPG starter sets (that arguably are more feature-rich) or is the same as the video game <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-xiv-online-complete-edition---digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Final Fantasy XIV Online Complete Edition</strong></u></a> that bundles the base game and all its expansions. </p><p>The production quality of this set is great, with thick paper for the characters sheets, the maps and books are glossy, and full-color books and cardboard tokens are sturdy (the tokens were a bit of a challenge to get out the punchboards in my copy), but it would have been nice to get miniatures of the four characters, too. The price tag stings a bit more, seeing as how both the player and gamemaster books are free downloads, so in essence, you are paying $60 bucks for some cardboard, dice, and folded-up maps.</p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 16, 2024 8:15 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>While both the look and feel of this starter set are top-notch, it’s unfortunate how light and lacking the content inside is. A number of the issues surrounding this kit will be alleviated once both the game master and player handbooks are released, and this kit can be used simply as a stepping-off point into the wider system and game, but until then, this is a very limited experience. The Final Fantasy XIV TTRPG ruleset looks to have some cool mechanics and show potential, but so much has been left out and left to speculation. I'm very interested in checking out more, so at least in that regard, the starter set succeeds – even if I don't know when exactly I will get that chance.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>This month, a major update for Once Human was released, and with it came some major features, such as Animal Capture and Animal Ranching. In addition to that, "The Living Plane" now takes to the skies, bringing new in-game events, a new motorcycle skin, and other new features. The September update for Once Human is also shaping up to be massive, adding a new PvP scenario to the game.</p>
<p>Once Human has performed remarkably well since release, reaching a peak of <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-exceeds-230000-peak-players-since-release-devs-tease-major-update/">230,000 concurrent players</a> and ranking fifth on Steam's player count chart. This game focuses heavily on multiplayer content, and the developers have been working tirelessly to add new content that will keep the audience entertained.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human丨Version 1.1 Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NkEIqrlIi3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since you are fighting for survival in the apocalyptic world, Animal Ranching can benefit you, allowing players to create and maintain their own farms. These farms can provide all sorts of benefits for the settlers at the camp, allowing players to get their hands on animals such as Boars, Deer, Wolves, Sheep, and more.</p>
<p>The animals can provide fur, milk, and meat by cultivating your own farm. If you don't have animals that can provide that, the more aggressive animals on your farm can help defend your settlement against any nearby threats. The Animal Ranching doesn't stop there, as a major update set for September will allow players to breed rare beasts, which can provide extra benefits to your pre-existing farm.</p>
<p>Moving on to "The Living Plane," a colossal beast that soars through the skies, players can mount this creature as of the August 15 update, where players can participate in exclusive shooting challenges to win special rewards.</p>
<p>"The Living Plane" challenges aren't only available from the August update. Players in Once Human will now be able to participate in "Open World Racing" events. In these events, players are responsible for building custom land vehicles to participate in points-based challenges. Taking more unique routes and separating from the crowd can earn more points.</p>
<p>In September, Once Human's second large-scale PvP scenario will launch. In it, players taking part in the Prismverse's Clash must choose to side with Rosetta or Mayfly. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTQGwdeqa8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this scenario</a>, players must battle camp anomalies to obtain Prism energy.</p>
<p>Once Human will also be showcased at Gamescom, only a few days away. Attendees will be able to participate in a dungeon specifically made for Gamescom, and winners will receive special Once Human gifts.</p>

Those affected will receive severance and career assistance, though further details about what those offerings include have not been revealed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/xdefiantthumb-1716583385007.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft lays off 45 developers across San Francisco and North Carolina offices.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Yesterday Ubisoft San Francisco and Red Storm Entertainment informed their teams of a restructuring that resulted in 45 employees leaving Ubisoft,” a Ubisoft spokesperson said in a statement. “This difficult yet necessary decision was made to align these studios’ organizations with their future business and development objectives. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to those affected, including severance and career assistance, and we thank them for their many contributions to Ubisoft.”</p><p>This is the second shift for the Red Storm team this summer, with the first arriving in May when Ubisoft announced that further development on its free-to-play spinoff, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland"><u>Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, was canceled</u></a>. At the time, the publisher called the move a “tough call” but would transition those members of the development team to other projects like XDefiant and Rainbow Six. It’s unclear how many members of the Red Storm team were affected by yesterday's layoffs.</p><p>Red Storm’s portfolio includes a number of noteworthy Ubisoft titles from the last few decades, including a number of entries in the Tom Clancy and Far Cry franchises. The studio also recently developed a VR-only title, Assassin’s Creed Nexus, which released last year. Ubisoft’s San Francisco branch developed titles in the Rocksmith series as well as South Park: The Fractured but Whole. It’s currently working on XDefiant and Rocksmith+.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft laid off a number of employees across a few separate instances last year, too, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-hit-by-more-layoffs-in-customer-service-and-elsewhere"><u>60 affected in May</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-lays-off-124-employees-to-enhance-collective-efficiency"><u>another 124 in November</u></a>.

<p>The playoff bracket for Modern Warfare 3’s category at the Esports World Cup is now fully assembled and is stacked top to bottom with CDL teams. Every lower-tier competitor has been eliminated, but nobody has gone home empty-handed. </p>



<p>From tomorrow, we’ll see the top eight teams at the event, including Cloud9, Atlanta FaZe, and OpTic Gaming, fight for the massive $600,000 grand prize and 1,000 Club Championship Points. It has been an intense couple of days across the tournament and some surprises have surfaced, suggesting that we’re going into a phenomenal weekend of COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-through-and-through">CDL Through and Through</h2>



<p>When the MW3 tournament kicked off at the Esports World Cup, a handful of Challengers-grade teams took to the stage. From the circuit below the CDL, we saw Gentle Mates, OMiT Brooklyn, Stallions, Lore Gaming, and then there was also Team Falcons, who qualified through a MENA circuit.</p>



<p>Today, the last of those teams were eliminated from the tournament as 100 Thieves swept Lore Gaming, which just weeks ago won the Challengers Champs tournament and secured a $60,000 prize.</p>



<p>Here are the fixtures that will kick off the single-elimination playoffs bracket tomorrow:</p>



<ul>
<li>Optic Gaming vs. Cloud9</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe vs. Boston Breach</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra vs. 100 Thieves</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge vs. Royal Ravens</li>
</ul>



<p>OpTic, Toronto, Surge, and FaZe all made it this far without dropping a series, but Cloud9 had a rough spot with Vancouver, securing a loss that led to a recovery against Gentle Mates. The fixture against Vancouver Surge was a hard slog that at times seemed bizarre. In the first round of Search on Invasion, HyDra went <strong>huge</strong>, securing a record of 21 – 9 – but it wasn’t enough to land the map win.</p>



<p>On the evening of August 18, our EWC champion will be crowned. The esports odds are looking good for FaZe, OpTic, and Toronto, but that’s nothing new. Will OpTic secure back-to-back world championship titles?</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/download-the-tetrachroma-demo-right-now</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/download-the-tetrachroma-demo-right-now.955512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/download-the-tetrachroma-demo-right-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I downloaded the demo for <em>TETRACHROMA</em> based on a tweet, and 70 minutes of my life disappeared. I am going to be blunt: The demo is very, very good. If you like <em>Tetris</em>, <em>Panel de Pon</em>, <em>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</em>, <em>Lumines</em>, or really any block-based puzzle game, you should just download it as soon as you are finished reading this blog, because it is one of the most beguiling twists on the genre I have seen for a very long time.</p><p><em>TETRACHROMA</em> by developer <a href="https://x.com/sparsevector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sparsevector</a> is functionally <em>Tetris </em>but with one small caveat – block color matters and lines can only be cleared when they are uniform in color. You are given a series of blocks of two colors, usually red and blue, and tasked with playing an otherwise normal <em>Tetris </em>game. If you drop a Tetrimo on a column or adjacent to the row, the block will transfer that color to the adjacent row and/or columns. This process, indicated by arrows, is interrupted only by gaps and blocks that match the color of the Tetrimo you are dropping.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>A very simple change creates complications very quickly. Credit: sparsevector </figcaption></figure><p>This may seem like a minor change, but in practice it can be maddening. By adding a tiny bit of friction, one other detail to account for, it disrupts the usual flow of <em>Tetris</em> play. By adding the variable of color, the way that you work your way through clearing blocks is totally altered. Often you are forced to choose between color uniformity and filling the row, which can quickly create sub-optimal situations. Sometimes, playing <em>Tetris</em> the way you normally would works out. Other times, it leads to an increasingly untenable mess. This complexity also further emphasizes the importance of the <a href="https://tetris.com/article/48/why-its-important-to-use-the-hold-queue-in-tetris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hold Queue</a>, as an errant block of the wrong color can be pocketed for future use. The color-changing mechanic also makes huge swings possible, and fighting your way out of a corner can feel intoxicating when you finally do it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The demo also features a nice puzzle mode. Credit: sparsevector</figcaption></figure><p>If this is in any way confusing, I can assure you that it all makes sense in play. I should also mention the idiosyncratic soundtrack, which plausibly feels like it belongs in an obscure puzzle game for the Sega Saturn or NeoGeo. (I was not expecting a track that sounds like <em>The Entertainer </em>on a player piano but with a really sick beat behind it). If this does not sound like your cup of tea, give it a shot. If you are a puzzle sicko already, you’re in for a treat. Personally, I can’t wait to see what the final game looks like.</p><p>The demo for <em>TETRACHROMA</em> is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702490/TETRACHROMA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, where it can also be wishlisted. It is slated for release some time in 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That seems like a potential red flag to me, but we’ll have to wait and see how the PS5 plays once folks can get their hands on it. </p><p>For now, here is what other critics and writers are saying abou<em>t Black Myth: Wukong</em> on PC:</p><hr><h2 id="h210995"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>God Is A Geek</em></a></span></h2><p><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a fantastic video game – and a staggering achievement from an indie studio. Like <em>Lies of P</em> last year and <em>Nioh 2</em> before it,<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a sterling example of how to take Soulslike elements and weave them into something that feels fresh and original. It’s gorgeous to look at, has some of the best music in any game this year so far, and presents itself with such confidence and panache that it’s hard to pick fault with it. </p><h2 id="h210996"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span></h2><p><em>Wukong</em> is one of the most joyful action RPGs I’ve played simply for how lovingly it treats its world and characters and, by extension, how much it clearly wants me to love them too. It worked: Punchy combat aside, I wanted to keep working through each area to meet another weird little creature with a mysterious quest or to get jumped by another animal who learned MMA. In a pool of games about fallen kings and sad dragons, it’s delightful to play an action game that isn’t obsessed with being dour and where the best solution to the most grueling fights is to use as many fun abilities as you can. </p><p>In a year with the tremendous <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC, I never thought I’d play a game that veers in such a wildly different direction but manages to reach similar highs, even if it lacks the sheer scale and build complexity as FromSoftware’s masterpiece.</p><p><em>Wukong</em> is its own beast and if it has to be labeled a soulslike, then I think we’re going to have to come up with a new definition. There’s nothing else quite like it.</p><h2 id="h210997"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rpgsite.net/review/16157-black-myth-wukong-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/16157-black-myth-wukong-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RPG Site</em></a></span></h2><p> Do I feel that the game is unfinished? In large pieces, yes, but at least with the story, no. I felt satisfied with how the tale wrapped up…but I can’t shake the multiple, lingering frustrations I had throughout the journey to the end.</p><p>A game with peaks and valleys like this is, as I’ve stated throughout the review, frustrating. I can <em>see</em> a 10/10 in this game somewhere, but multiple questionable-level design and game design choices combined with a hefty amount of performance issues and bugs unfortunately drag it down. <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is a beautiful, somber, fascinating tale to experience — you just have to muddle your way through a forest of problems to enjoy it.</p><h2 id="h210998"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Sixth Axis</em></a></span></h2><p><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a stunning game to look at, but the exploration is lacking, and the fighting is just sort of fine for the most part. It’s just a bit uninspiring, and isn’t a game that I’m expecting to stick with me for any length of time now that I’m done with it. </p><h2 id="h210999"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h2><p> As GameScience’s debut action game,<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. </p><p>Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as <em>Elden Ring </em>ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears.</p><p> Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs. </p><h2 id="h211000"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GamesRadar</em></a></span></h2><p> I absolutely loved <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> for the first two chapters, but recurring annoyances and some drawn-out sections began to wear me down around the halfway point. Combat carries the experience, the story is interesting albeit too fragmented to put me on the edge of my seat, and the world is a wondrous place to be. </p><p>It’s exciting to see such a rich setting, which has gone largely untapped in games, treated with clear love and care by an action RPG of this scale. Despite some frustrations,<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> feels great and finishes strong – so strong that I’ve half a mind to give New Game Plus a try, if only to find yet more stuff I missed. </p><h2 id="h211001"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><p><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is definitely not a souls-like. What I wasn’t expecting was for it to be essentially a lengthy boss rush. It’s not uncommon to go from one boss fight into another and then another, and it’s in these elaborate battles where <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>shines. The moments in between, however, aren’t quite as strong, sometimes devolving into aimless tedium. But its satisfying combat and unique variety of boss fights mostly manages to overcome these flaws. </p><h2 id="h211002"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamerant</em></a></span></h2><p>  <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a game that shies away from the Soulslike label, yet it is clearly gunning for the Soulslike audience. It is far from the best in the genre, but it’s also not the worst game that has followed in <em>Dark Souls</em>’ footsteps. </p><p>If you go into it expecting a mostly standard Soulslike experience with some blood-boiling boss encounters mixed in with basic level design, you will have a better time than if you were going into it expecting it to be like a traditional character action game. </p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> offers about 30 hours of gameplay for its first playthrough with a ton of side content to check out as well, but many will tire of the limited combat options long before they reach its dazzling yet equally aggravating final boss fight.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase is set to stream on Tuesday, August 20 at 2 p.m. Eastern/ 11 a.m. Pacific, and will include new trailers, announcements, and developers talking about their upcoming projects. We asked the <em>Kotaku </em>staff about some pie-in-the-sky hopes and dreams they want to see at the show, and also mixed in one prediction based on Keighley’s track record. Here are a few things we’ve got our fingers crossed for.<br></p></div><div><p>I feel like every day for the past six months or so I’ve been certain Paramount and Sega would finally blow the lid off the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>promotion and put out a trailer for the next live-action movie. And every day I have been disappointed. We are nearly four months away from this movie’s premiere on December 20, and most of the public hasn’t seen so much as a frame of the Keanu Reeves-led film. Paramount doesn’t need to rely on Geoff’s latest showcase for an audience, but it seems like they’re waiting for <em>something </em>grand considering they’ve barely done any promotion for the movie this close to its release. The <em>Sonic </em>fandom is driving itself up the wall living on crumbs. It’s time, Paramount. Give Geoff the trailer so he can give it that World Premiere 9000. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>It’s usually a safe bet that Hideo Kojima makes some kind of appearance in a Geoff Keighley joint because the host will not let us forget they’re besties. Kojima Productions does have three known game projects in the works between <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <em>OD</em>, and <em>Physint</em>, but it does seem like the Norman Reedus-led sequel is the most imminent. We haven’t seen the game in almost seven months, and if it’s coming in 2025, I could see Kojima bringing at least a small teaser of some kind to the show. If not, I’d put Kojima getting any kind of mention on my bingo card. Geoff can’t help himself. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Despite everything going on over at Microsoft, or maybe <em>due </em>to it, I’m really rooting for the studios that fall under its umbrella. I’m excited for a number of upcoming games out of several of those teams, like <em>Avowed</em>, which we know is already going to be at Gamescom. So instead of going with the all-too-safe pick, I want to see something that’s seemed a bit more nebulous of late: <em>Fable</em>. We’ve known about this upcoming series reboot for some time now, and Playground Games has been hard at work on it for a while, but it hasn’t really amounted to much outside of some CG trailers and a “gameplay” trailer that hardly featured any of it earlier this year. Show me the damn game, Microsoft.</p><p>I want to be stoked for this upcoming RPG, especially considering how obsessed I was with <em>Fable 2 </em>as a kid. I never actually got around to playing the entire series though, and by the time I got a platform that could play them, the world had moved on from <em>Fable</em>. It’s back now though, and I’m finally in a position to be there for a <em>Fable </em>launch. Considering the game is supposed to be out next year, <em>Fable </em>should probably start appearing at as many shows as possible before it comes out, why not start here and now? —Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Earlier this year, after many rumors, Xbox confirmed that a handful of once-exclusive games would arrive on PlayStation and Switch. This led to <em>Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush</em> and a few others becoming multiplatform titles. While none of these were <em>Halo</em>-level big, it did show that<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805"> Xbox was willing to become a more multiplatform brand</a></span> moving forward. And now, there are new rumors that another Xbox game will be making the leap to PlayStation and it will be revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p><p>What game will Xbox toss over the fence and let PlayStation users enjoy? We’re not sure yet. At one point it was rumored to be<em> Forza Horizon 5</em>, but <em>Verge </em>reporter Tom Warren has said that’s not the case. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1824126136361558124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1824126136361558124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warren also suggested</a></span> it won’t be a<em> Gears of War</em> or <em>Halo</em> game, nor will it be Bethesda’s open-world RPG <em>Starfield</em>. So what <em>could</em> it be? It could be 2023’s<em> Forza Motorsport</em>, though I’m not sure Xbox wants to make that franchise multiplatform. More likely it will be something older and not as popular, like the first games that hopped over to other consoles. So I’d predict <em>Killer Instinct </em>or <em>Rare Replay. </em>There’s also the possibility that something that hasn’t launched yet, like that upcoming <em>Indiana Jones</em> game, gets a PS5 port. We’ll have to wait and see what Xbox is willing to share. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Remedy Entertainment announced it was remaking the original two<em> Max Payne </em>games back in 2022. It felt a bit unnecessary and quixotic to me at the time, but the more time passes, the more I hunger for the classic, brooding detective thrillers to get their next-gen makeover. I’m not sure how the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091">PS2 games will translate</a></span> to modern sensibilities around third-person shooting and level design, but fortunately that’s not my job to figure it out. The first two <em>Max Payne </em>games remain all-timers, and as worthy of being remade as <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Metal Gear</em>, or anything else.</p><p>The studio is also at the height of its creative juice coming off of <em>Control</em> and <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, so I’m eager to see whether Remedy plays the remakes as straight visual overhauls or goes completely meta with their return as creative director Sam Lake is fond of doing. The timing also feels ripe for a peak of how the project’s been going. The studio recently announced the <em>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake</em> was in full production, and 2025 seems like a good window for a full release. I want to see Punchinello Manor in all its modern, ray-traced glory. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
