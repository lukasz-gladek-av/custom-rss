You earn back five percent of the amount you spend on games as this store currency, which can then be used to get money off further purchases on the eStore. So if you spend $60 on a new title, you’d usually receive $3 into your account. Which might not sound a <em>huge </em>amount, until the next time you’re browsing the store to look at indie games on sale, and realize you can have the one that takes your eye for free! It makes buying things on the Nintendo console store feel directly rewarding, rather than the more intangible offers from Microsoft of Sony.</p><p>Which makes it really odd that it’s coming to an end. Gold Points you already have will continue to work as before—they’re valid for 12 months after you receive them, and you’ll still be able to use them for discounts until the last possible date, March 24, 2026. You can also still receive them until that March 24, 2025 date, on any digital or physical purchases you make. Further, physical games published ahead of the deadline will still be redeemable, even after March 24.</p><p>There’s no information regarding whether Gold Points will be redeemable against Switch 2 games on that device’s store.

This was a separate money saver for Nintendo Switch Online users, where you could buy two big-name games at a discounted price.</p><p>Obviously, this is all timed ahead of the launch of the Switch 2, expected some time perhaps in May or June this year. But it remains deeply strange, given the Switch 1 will have a long tail, its eStore will remain online and updated with new games for years to come, and its customers will now seemingly be getting a worse deal.</p><p>It could be—in fact it’s extremely likely—that Nintendo will announce a whole new loyalty scheme for the Switch 2, and is looking to reset everything ahead of that. But unless original Switch users will also gain the benefits, it’ll be a huge bummer. It’s also extremely odd that any of this is happening <em>before</em> the Switch 2 launches. Nintendo may well have plans for something even better, but if so, there would surely be a better way to go about announcing things.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-elden-ring-nightreign-have-pvp/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nightreign incorporates a lot of what made the original so special. But one element players fight tooth and nail over is each other. I’m here to tell you if Elden Ring Nightreign features any PVP or if it’s solely PVE.</p>



<p>I got to experience the debut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test</a>. I was blown away by how incredible it was and how much it differs from Elden Ring. It looks the same on the surface, but the overall feel, speed, and complexity make it a tough and tantalizing proposition.</p>



<p>You’re encouraged to team up, traverse The Lands Between, and take down familiar FromSoftware bosses. But some players want a break from AI to take on real people. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> having PVP would scratch this painful itch, so let’s see if it’s possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-pvp-in-elden-ring-nightreign">Can You PVP in Elden Ring Nightreign?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No time for PVP right now. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign doesn’t include any PVP and the only combat in the game is played out in classic PVE fashion with human players against enemy AI.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, if you’re big into PVP, Nightreign might not be the Souls game for you. In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with IGN</a>, game director Junya Ishizaki talked a lot about Nightreign and what the team wants to accomplish with it.</p>



<p>The topic of PVP came up when interviewer Tristan Ogilvie asked: “Are there any other sort of modes planned, like a PvP battle royale or anything like that?” Ishizaki responded: “<strong>Currently there are no plans</strong>. We wanted to first and foremost concentrate on this three-player co-op experience. So that’s the main focus for now.”</p>



<p>Nightreign will launch with no PVP features unless something changes between now and launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pvp-be-added-to-elden-ring-nightreign">Will PVP be Added to Elden Ring Nightreign?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no confirmation from FromSoftware about adding PVP to Elden Ring Nightreign in the future but never say never.</strong></p>



<p>Alluding to the IGN interview above, Junya Ishizaki was quoted saying “<strong>Currently</strong>” when it came to PVP ideas. This doesn’t mean the developer won’t look to add PVP in a future update. The sole focus is on delivering a complete and coherent three-player experience with working functionality.</p>



<p>But we know more content is going to be available at launch. Furthermore, additional content is arriving post-launch. PVP may eventually get added if the team can implement it effectively.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for any further updates on Elden Ring Nightreign’s PVP status.</p>



<hr>



<p>Check out the latest Elden Ring Nightreign details and questions including if you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-with-two-players-or-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play it Solo or with two players</a>.</p>



<p>Can Nightreign be the start of something special for the Souls genre? Or are you hoping this is a one-and-done deal for FromSoftware so it can move on to a new project?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming sources have said that the publisher and the developers are now confident that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on March 20, 2025.</p>



<p>Of course, never say never of another delay, but Ubisoft has made preparations to increase its marketing of Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its March 20, 2025 launch, including finalising the embargo dates for the games review.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows reviews will be live on March 18, 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking with several developers working on the game, they said that they felt confident that it will be ready for its March release date, with one source stating that the game is now “pretty much done”.</p>



<p>As mentioned during Ubisoft’s latest earnings call, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows is currently on par with that of Assassins Creed Odyssey</a> in terms of its pre-order numbers. “Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by the dual protagonist approach,” Guillemot said in the most recent earnings call.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Shadows currently has around 300,000 pre-orders, said sources and Odyssey’s day one player numbers were between 400-450,000; a gap of around 100-150,000 that needs to be made up in the next four weeks.</p>



<p>In comparison, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws, a game that failed to meet Ubisoft’s expectations</a> had less than half the pre-orders Shadows currently has in the same time period before launch, it was said.</p>



<p>Looking at the data, if Shadows continues the same trajectory as Odyssey throughout launch, it’s estimated that the game could sell approximately 3.5 million units in its first month. Valhalla, which was the series’ most successful Assassin’s Creed game had some eight million players in its first month, with more than 65% being attributed to past-generation consoles at the time.</p>



<p>Will you be buying Assassin’s Creed Shadows? Let us know in the comments or in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

this content!</p></div><p>While Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will primarily stick to the gameplay of the original PS2 game, you can expect several enhancements and quality-of-life changes.</p><p>First off, you'll be able to choose between playing the game with modern controls in a modern third-person action game format <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-let-you-play-the-game-with-its-original-ancient-controls/1100-6524131/" data-ref-id="1100-6524131">or you can opt for a setup closer to the original game</a> that comes with a traditional MGS top-down viewpoint. Players can also change their equipped camouflage on the fly with a quick-select button.</p><p>On a technical level, the shift to Unreal Engine 5 has also allowed Konami to overhaul the animations of Snake Eater as part of its modernization efforts.</p><p>"At the early stages, we had planned on only overhauling the graphics to modern standards, but we just didn’t think it would be satisfying to play if that was the only update, so in the end we remade nearly all the animations, and found ways to refresh almost every facet of the game, as well as fully realizing elements that were held back by technical limitations at the time of the original," series producer Noriaki Okamura said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-2025-on-ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>The original voiceover recordings from Snake Eater on PS2 have been kept for the remake, but some new lines have been recorded.</p><p>"We're using all the original voice performances, but there are some lines where characters teach you the controls that really don't match anymore," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-features-a-few-new-lines-from-snake-eaters-original-cast/1100-6524174/" data-ref-id="1100-6524174">Okamura explained in a 2024 interview</a>. "So we actually did get the original actors to re-record just those. Plus, back then, twenty years ago, we actually had to compress the voice acting down a lot to fill all that audio. Today, we aren't as limited. We don't have to compromise as much on formats and compression, so we can actually have those performances in even higher quality."</p><h2>What does Metal Gear Solid Delta mean?</h2><p>Confused by the use of that Greek symbol? The <a href="https://twitter.com/Metalgear/status/1661550418357534721">official Metal Gear Twitter account</a> explained that the Delta symbol was chosen because its meaning "fits the concept" of the remake project. "Delta means change or difference without changing structure," according to the account.</p><h2>Is Hideo Kojima involved in Metal Gear Solid Delta?</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTXRjuPJA4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jHTXRjuPJA4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hideo Kojima and his key collaborators have no involvement with Delta. In an interview with <a href="https://za.ign.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/176621/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-devs-on-whether-kojima-is-involved-and-why-they-picked-this-game" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, Konami confirmed that Metal Gear Solid 3 director Hideo Kojima and his frequent artistic collaborator Yoji Shinkawa, who helped establish the signature design of the Metal Gear Solid series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-isnt-involved-in-the-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-konami-confirms/1100-6514670/" data-ref-id="1100-6514670">are not involved with the remake</a>.</p><p>"They are not involved," a Konami spokesperson said. "However, the development team will work hard to create this remake and also the ports--for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection--so that they can be enjoyed on multiple platforms by even more players all around the world."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-expected-to-leave-konami-after-mgs5-inside-/1100-6426024/">After Kojima and Konami split ways</a> during the development of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Konami began distancing itself and the series from Kojima. It even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lawyers-reportedly-block-metal-gear-solid-creator-/1100-6432799/">blocked him from accepting an award</a> in person for The Phantom Pain at The Game Awards in 2015.</p><p>If there is one positive takeaway from the reveal trailer, it's that this cinematic teaser has a <em>lot </em>of references to Snake Eater throughout it. While it might look like a BBC documentary that explains how the food chain works, you can see references to Shagohod, The End's faithful companion, and even a codec conversation about giant ants.</p>

			<p>Being a huge fan of the Monster Hunter series, rumors of FromSoftware working on a similar experience based on Elden Ring got me quite excited. When Elden Ring Nightreign was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">announced</a>, however, I have to admit I wasn't particularly excited about the little that was shown, as I felt that the trademark FromSoftware gameplay mechanics, like the weighty combat and in-depth exploration, weren't really a good fit for a game that looked to be all about exploring maps as quickly as possible to power-up and survive the final boss encounter. The more I learned about the game, the more I felt this co-op venture could be a fun little game to play every now and then before getting abandoned in favor of meatier experiences.</p>
<p>After playing the game's Closed Network Test, however, I realized how wrong I was. FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Elden-Ring-Nightreign-01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The basics of Elden Ring Nightreign are really straightforward. From the iconic Roundtable Hold, players can decide to undertake expeditions with three other players, picking one of four Nightfarers, which will become eight in the launch version, all coming with unique special abilities, before getting thrown into one of the game's maps, where they need to survive for three days. At the end of the third day, the squad will get to fight one of the main bosses and will be rewarded with relics that represent the game's permanent upgrade system, which improves characters with a variety of different perks. Relics can also be obtained if the squad fails to get to the third day and defeat the final boss, so players still get something for taking part in expeditions.</p>
<p>On paper, winning a game doesn't sound too difficult, but in reality, Elden Ring Nightreign does its very best to prevent players from reaching the final night. At the start of a game, all characters start with very weak equipment and must obtain better weapons and gear by clearing locations on the map or defeating minor bosses to be able to take on even more challenges, all the while discovering Sites of Graces which automatically restore the character's HP and FP, the latter used to perform Weapon Skills, as well as Flask charges and level up once enough Runes have been obtained. All of this would still have been easy enough, especially with a competent team that sticks together, if it weren't for the time limit for each day, which is represented by a blue circle that gets smaller and smaller as time goes by. At some point, the circle will become very small, indicating that the squad should quickly head over to the location indicated by a tree icon on the interface to fight the night's boss and move on to the following day. All in all, despite the wrenches the game launches, it is a much more straightforward experience than the base game, which is quite simple to understand after a couple of games.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Elden Ring Nightreign features some roguelike mechanics which come into full force as soon as a game begins. All the weapons and perks that can be obtained are randomly generated, forcing players to make decisions that will shape their builds on the fly. As of the Closed Network Test version, the game features a very good number of weapons coming with different quality levels, but many of them feel too much like others, often having only the Weapon Skill to differentiate them, leading to some bloat in this regard.</p>
<p>I feel fewer weapons that are better differentiated would work better, considering the game wants players to move quickly from one place to another without spending too much time thinking about which weapon to pick, something that is clearly highlighted not only by the fast traversal speed of all characters, the lack of fall damage and the chance to get invaded at any time randomly by some powerful bosses, such as Margit the Fell Omen, who is just as annoying in Elden Ring Nightreign as he is for Elden Ring new players the first time they encounter him. With these variables, death is always behind the corner, but, in true FromSoftware fashion, it is not the end, as it is possible to get revived by other players for a short amount of time. If the other players fail to revive a companion, the dead player will be sent back to the last Site of Grace for the price of all their Runes and one level, which can be restored by recovering them from where the player died.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Elden-Ring-Nightreign-02-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the chaotic experience of the Elden Ring Nightreign Closed Network Test was generally fun, especially when playing together with others who didn't strike off on their own (a death sentence in this game), it also highlighted some issues that must be addressed before launch for the experience to reach its full potential. The lack of duos matchmaking is a major oversight that will hopefully be changed in the launch version, considering how popular it is in other co-op games and how it should be more than viable in the game, especially to up the challenge level a bit if the current balance is kept. As of now, the vast majority of bosses are quite easy to take down, with only some exceptions, even at a low level, so if the balance doesn't change in the final release, playing the game with only one other companion could definitely make things more interesting, though I would prefer for the general challenge level to go up regardless.</p>
<p>The biggest issue that could make or break Elden Ring Nightreign, however, lies in how map variations will be handled. In the Network Test version, getting to the final boss in a game was pretty much a matter of collecting as many Flask upgrades as possible, which granted excellent survivability in the vast majority of scenarios, allowing some players to even explore outside the blue circle, which drains HP, using the Sites of Grace to restore HP and Flask charges as they went. As such, in one of the final testing sessions, pretty much everyone was pinning for the churches where the Flask upgrades are located, resulting in an experience that was becoming stale fast, no matter the picked Nightfarer or the randomized elements. I sincerely hope the final game will go all out regarding map variations, or the whole experience will turn into a rush toward Flask upgrades that will get boring very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Even though the experience wasn't perfect, the Closed Network Test&nbsp;<span>succeeded in making me excited about the unique take on the Souls gameplay formula featured in Elden Ring Nightreign. I am now really looking forward to trying out the game when it launches in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May.</a> Hopefully, FromSoftware will be able to address some of the CNT version issues by then</span>&nbsp;and fully realize the potential of the experience.</p>

            <p>I really, really like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> It might just be that this logic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> stick its thumb out noticeably from the omnipresent gaggle of post-roguelite survivalyptic soulsbuilder decklikes, but I suspect it's also down to the deeply satisfying bloopy twinkle dink that plays whenever you drop someone into a seat with your floating hand cursor.</p>
<p>You've got a limited number of seats and a bunch of jolly demand-os, and it's your job to make them all happy. "I want to sit with Bob". "I need a window seat". "I forgot to shower". "I do not like bad smells". So you quarantine the nostril bombers in the back of your limo, make sure everyone else is happy, and drive off to the next level. There, you'll take the role of a cinema usher. Some punters want to sit next to someone with popcorn so they can steal it, and some want to wear massive cowboy hats that block those behind them. It's all quite simple, but robust, and just thoughtful enough to lightly tickle your synapses, like a gentle grizzly bear wielding an illustrious peacock feather.</p>

<p>Here's what the Steam page - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">which also has a demo</a> - has to say:</p>
<blockquote>"Window seat or aisle? Booth or table? Lone wolf or life of the party? In Is This Seat Taken?, your mission is to organize groups of people according to their preferences. It’s a cozy, no-pressure logic puzzle game where you’re in charge of who sits where."</blockquote><p>

Here are some features, arranged in the correct order:

</p><blockquote><ul>
<li>Play seating matchmaker to please picky characters.</li>
<li>Discover each character’s unique traits—relatable, outlandish, and everything in between.</li>
<li>Piece together satisfying puzzles with no timers or leaderboards.</li>
<li>Unlock fun new scenarios as you progress—from bus rides to banquets!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed this one, as I said. I'm almost positive its a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head. The world's first <em>Seatlike</em>? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed. No release date just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar Games are considering letting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> players modify the game’s map by way of Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics, according to a report. The idea is that people can make and sell their own “custom experiences”, as they do in those games - expanding upon the existing customisation opportunities in GTA Online. This might even extend to featuring real-world sponsors, rather than the parody versions of familiar brands we encounter in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. 
</p>
<p>
All of that’s from <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/">a Digiday article</a> that cites three anonymous industry sources “with knowledge” of meetings between Rockstar and certain popular Fortnite, Roblox and GTA Online creators. Apparently, they’ve been having “open-ended” discussions about “the potential to create custom experiences inside the upcoming game”. These experiences “would allow creators to modify the game’s environment and assets to bring their own intellectual property - and potentially their brand sponsors - into GTA’s virtual sandbox”, the article notes.
</p>
<p>
Why do all this, given Rockstar’s historically iffy relationship with those who attempt to mod their games? Because publishers always want to make more money, and because GTA 6 in particular is said to be mindbogglingly expensive. It’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/13/gta-6-cost-2-000-000-000-make-claims-leak-eight-times-gta-5-21413035/">rumoured</a> to have cost two billion dollars to date. Hence the pressure to add monetisation features.
</p>
<p>
The Digiday article includes some third party comment that puts a spotlight on FiveM, the immensely popular mod framework from CFX.re that lets people host their own GTA role-playing servers, and supports subscription access models. Rockstar used to be at war with CFX.re as part of their larger policy towards piracy: they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">banned</a> members of the modding team back in 2015 and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/take-two-reportedly-sent-private-investigators-to-modders-home/">reportedly</a> sent private investigators to somebody’s home. Then, in August 2023, they <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update">announced</a> that they’d bought the CFX.re team and “expanded our policy on mods to officially include those made by the roleplay creative community.”
</p>
<p>
Digiday offer the FiveM arc as evidence that Rockstar are getting more into user-generated content platforms and Ye Olde Metaversing with GTA 6. All of which makes sense to me, though the developers and publisher Take-Two Interactive have yet to comment on the report at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">wait for a GTA 6 PC release date continues</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FromSoftware games have always had an element of multiplayer. Elden Ring Nightreign also encourages this, but playing with two players is the dream for many duos. We’ve got the latest details on Nightreign’s party-formation features. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a breath of fresh air from the minds at FromSoftware. This isn’t to say the company’s work is bad—not by a long shot—but Nightreign has a different feel. The take-your-time exploration of Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Bloodborne is replaced by frantic battling and a constant race to clear bosses and level up as fast as possible.</p>



<p>A typical lobby involves three of you wailing away at tanky foes. But let’s see if it’s possible to play Nightreign as just two players or even one.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-elden-ring-nightreign-two-player">Is Elden Ring Nightreign Two Player?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Three players might be advisable. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign currently doesn’t permit you to play with two players.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Network Test</a> gave us a glimpse into <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nightreign</a>‘s potential. However, we also learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign is suited to a Trio</a>. This direction comes at the behest of game director Junya Ishizaki.</p>



<p>He explained: “The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way.”</p>



<h2 id="h-will-elden-ring-nightreign-add-a-two-player-mode">Will Elden Ring Nightreign Add a Two Player Mode?</h2>



<p>Junya Ishizaki has said even though the Network Test didn’t allow for two-player teams, FromSoftware is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-considering-allowing-just-two-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering allowing two players</a>.</p>



<p>“Regarding having just two players, not three players or Solo, <strong>it is something we are considering</strong>, but it is currently not in the game at the moment,” explained Ishizaki.</p>



<p>Technically, you can invite a friend and play a game of Nightreign together. But you still have to partner up with a third person to complete the matchmaking process. If the third person leaves for whatever reason, it becomes you and your friend battling as a duo!</p>



<p>We’re still a while out from Nightreign’s full release, so we’ll have to see if FromSoftware changes its mind before the anticipated launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">Can You Play Elden Ring Nightreign Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Elden Ring Nightreign can be played Solo if you’re not up to having partners</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though you can’t in two-player, Solo is an option. I wouldn’t say it’s smart (or feasible) to play Nightreign on your own though, so tread carefully around The Lands Between. </p>



<hr>



<p>Will you be put off buying Elden Ring Nightreign if it debuts without a two-player mode? Or are you tough enough to take on the Nights on your own?</p>



<p>If you missed out on the initial test runs, fear not, more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign Test Sessions</a> may be coming to give you a chance to get involved.</p>

But, as has been the case with most previous PlayStation upgrades, anyone who simply played Days Gone via PS Plus will need to pay the full $50 price tag, rather than $10.

"I would've payed $10 for the upgrade just to try it out despite the fact that a remaster for this game is not necessary," wrote AdSevere4623 on reddit, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/">lengthy thread full of complaints about the issue</a>.
</p>
<p>
"CD Projekt Red gives us free Witcher 3 PS5 upgrade so many years after release and Sony charges $50 if you have PS Plus version," added Mo-Skito.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this isn't the first time this situation has occured. 
</p>
<p>
Another game to offer an enhanced PS5 version with a paid-for upgrade is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> Intergrade. And again, you needed to actually own the PS4 version to be eligible. If you simply had access to Rebirth on PS4 via PlayStation Plus, you couldn't upgrade for less.
</p>
<p>
Things worked slightly differently with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which was given away by Sony back during the era of Covid lockdowns. In this case, users with a free copy were then able to apply that game's $10 upgrade to access its PS5 version. But that was a license for the full game - rather than relying on a subscription to access it.
</p>
<p>
Still, some fans say the policy should change to be more akin to that of Xbox - where you can pay a modest amount to upgrade access to titles on Game Pass, and gain their deluxe edition.
</p>
<p>
Others, meanwhile, have pointed to the fact that you can buy DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> - such as the Burning Shores DLC for Horizon Forbidden West. Is this add-on much different?
</p>
<p>
"This is as stupid as requiring someone to pay for the full game when purchasing a DLC for a PS+ game," CoolGur878 noted. "And, mind you, PS+ is not a free service."
</p>
<p>
In addition to having fancier visuals, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-definitive-edition-announced-for-pc-and-ps5">Days Gone Remastered will offer a new survival arcade mode named Horde Assault</a>, plus fresh permadeath and speedrun modes for the main game.
</p>
<p>
These extra contents for Days Gone Remastered will also be offered on PC, as a $10 DLC.
</p>
<p>
Days Gone developer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">recently working on an under-wraps live-service game for PlayStation</a>, though this was reportedly cancelled following Concord's high-profile flop. It's unclear what the developer is putting together next.

We now know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is set to launch in 2025</a>, but it will be released into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTQ5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">The Switch 2’s bigger screen is just what I wanted</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">The Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>You can always count on Nintendo for a surprise. This is the company that followed the Game Boy with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a strange dual-screened handheld</a> and broke out of its GameCube slump with a console focused on motion controls. It’s the company that lost its lead with the Wii U and then gambled on another innovation — the portable hybrid known as the Switch — to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718273/nintendo-2023-big-moment-mario-zelda">ultimately get back on top</a>. All of those were big, risky swings that seemingly exemplified the company’s playful, experimental ethos.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, is… <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">a bigger, better Switch</a>. It’s kind of boring. But it’s also exactly the right move from Nintendo. At a time when people expect their games and experiences to carry over between devices, the old console paradigm of starting over with a new generation doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. And since Nintendo hit a home run with the original Switch, it has the runway to be a little bit boring this time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Whenever the Switch 2 comes out, it’ll have competition from handheld PCs.</p><p>As I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">earlier this month</a>, “it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo.”</p><p>Yes, the Switch 2 will probably outsell most handheld gaming PCs by a wide margin.

According to Dbrand CEO Adam Ijaz, the Killswitch is based on the “actual dimensions” of the new console obtained from a “3D scan of the real hardware.” But in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, he declined to say exactly how or where Dbrand obtained such information.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTkwOA==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks">The Switch 2 leaks keep coming</a></h2><div><p>New day, new Nintendo Switch 2 leaks.

Interestingly, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> report that the screen will “most likely” be an “OLED panel” — previous reports have said the console would have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051407/analyst-tips-8-inch-lcd-for-nintendo-switch-2">an LCD screen</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjcyOQ==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">Is this the Nintendo Switch 2?</a></h2><div><p>Nintendo isn’t officially at CES, but it might have stolen the show anyway: accessory maker Genki brought a 3D-printed mockup of what it says is Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we got to hold it and take some high-resolution pictures.</p><p>Based on the mockup of what we’ll call the Switch 2, Nintendo’s next console appears to be wider than the original, with slightly larger Joy-Con controllers that seem like they’ll be more comfortable to hold.

<p>Nintendo released a notice today announcing the discontinuation of My Nintendo Gold Points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the My Nintendo reward program, players could earn Gold Points when purchasing digital Nintendo Switch games or DLC. The earned points could be used towards rewards and discounts on the My Nintendo Store and Nintendo eShop. However, after March 25, 2025, at 1:30, Gold Points will no longer be awarded on eligible purchases.</p>



<p>Fortunately, players can use Gold Points they have already earned for longer, as they are valid for 12 months after receipt. Moreover, there are some cases where Gold Points may be awarded after the discontinuation date; check them out below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Players will earn Gold Points if they pre-order a downloadable product before the end of the bonus period.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gold Points can be earned if players purchase a packaged version of software released before the expiration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Also, suppose players purchase Nintendo Switch (OLED model) White/Customized, Nintendo Switch Customization, or Nintendo Switch Lite Yellow/Turquoise/Grey/Coral/Blue from the My Nintendo Store before the reward expiration date and time. In that case, they will be able to earn Gold Points after the shipping date. Check out more details about earning Gold Points after the discontinuation date <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0218.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>

            <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has said he took the job overseeing indie games for PlayStation because he "had no choice" - and now they're selling better than ever on the console.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/">Venturebeat</a>, Yoshida discussed his 30+ year career at PlayStation, including his move in 2019 from president of SIE Worldwide Studios to overseeing a new initiative focused on independent developers.</p>
<p>"Well, I had no choice," said Yoshida about the move. "When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company."</p>

<p>He continued: "But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose."</p>
<p>Yoshida explained PlayStation had been criticised by indie developers, that "PlayStation doesn't care about indies". That's now changed, he believes, with indie games on PlayStation selling better than PC in some instances.</p>
<p>"You don't hear that kind of criticism anymore," said Yoshida. "Last year we had lots of anecdotes from our indie partners that their new games were selling better on PlayStation than any other platform. Thats amazing. Some games sold better on PlayStation than on PC. When I started that work five years ago, our indie partners would say that when they released their games multiplatform, the Switch version would sell three to five times more than PlayStation. Bit by bit, that gap has narrowed down. We have a strong team inside the company supporting indies."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last month</a>, though clarified in this interview that he hasn't retired. He "felt good about the state of [PlayStation's] support for indies" and so decided to leave. As such, he plans to still work with indie developers.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. I love working with these younger, talented developers," said Yoshida. "They come up with amazing games every year. Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies. They're bringing something exciting to the industry. It's a lot of fun. That's my dream job, to be able to help them."</p>
<p>Yoshida also addressed current issues in the games industry, in particular why development has slowed down and so many layoffs have occurred.</p>
<p>"I think it's an overreaction to the Covid situation," he said. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves. Then we had to face reality and make adjustments. If you take out the Covid years you'd have smoother growth over the years."</p>
<p>Yoshida discussed his beginnings at Sony, courting companies like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Namco to move development to PlayStation, and his own work on games like Crash Bandicoot and Gran Turismo. "Crash Bandicoot was my first product, though," he said. "Mark Cerny and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> taught me a lot. They trained me as a producer."</p>
<p>A big shift at Sony happened ahead of the PS4. The PS3 was "another hard time", Yoshida explained - a topic also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it">covered recently on Eurogamer by fellow former PlayStation exec Shawn Layden</a>. "We were losing a billion dollars. I thought PlayStation was finished."</p>
<p>As such, with development of the PS4, hardware and software teams worked more closely together to ensure the console was easy to develop for and collaboration could occur. That's how the controller's Share button was created, for instance.</p>
<p>"Starting with PS4 and PS Vita, that wall broke down," said Yoshida. "We became part of the hardware design process. We loved that. Lots of things about the hardware came from ideas and feedback from the game team. So we loved the system. We knew what we were getting. We were making prototypes based on the hardware prototypes."</p>
<p>He added: "But we still didn't know if it was going to succeed, until Microsoft made some great decisions for us. They put the ball on the tee and let us take our swing. We couldn't have asked for better competition."</p>
<p>Since leaving PlayStation, Yoshida has been interviewed a number of times, discussing everything from a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">new Bloodborne game</a>, to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ill-fated-nintendo-playstations-first-game-was-a-space-shooter-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">ill-fated Nintendo PlayStation's first game</a>.</p>
<p>And beyond helping indie games, he's starring in one too: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">Yoshida has voiced a character in the forthcoming Promise Mascot Agency</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
During a recent house clearout I discovered a cache of creative writing from my teenage years. Naturally, I now consider most of it to be unbearable. Reading certain notebooks makes me feel as though my stomach is mounting an upwards assault on my brain. BURN IT, scream the parts of said brain that have learned the perils of starting poems with "O Muse". BURN IT ALL. Nonetheless, I felt bad about being mean towards my adolescent self, so I popped all those misbegotten papers in a giant suitcase. It squats next to me right now as I type these words, like a mausoleum filled with dead albatrosses. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly mixed emotions appear to inform <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amphora-hell">Amphora Hell</a>, in which you play an amphora (read: ancient species of vase) with legs. The amphora is the work of the Kilnmaster, a terrible Olympian force who is one part Hephaestus to one part shmup villain. The Kilnmaster has just decided that he hates his amphora with legs and wishes to destroy it with flying hammers. "No evidence of my failure must remain," he bellows in the Itch preamble. "Prepare to be scrapped!"
</p><!--more-->
<p>
What follows is a sort of arcade pisstake of neurotic perfectionism and the way projects we deem write-offs may refuse to let go of our imaginations. It's a simple play, so simple that my previous sentence feels desperately overloaded.</p>
<p>As the amphora, you run right or left on a stack of lanes and moving platforms, trying to avoid twirling hammers that appear at random from either side. The challenge increases rapidly: stay intact for 40 seconds or so and the Kilnmaster's nightmarishly disembodied head will appear and coast towards you, purring threats like a demon vocoder. The unspoken objective is to last long enough to hear the entirety of the game's pulsing background track. I have yet to manage this.
</p>
<p>
I like this game because it's a self-deprecating introduction to creator June Flowers's <a href="https://june-flower.itch.io/">other experiments</a>, which range from "the first gunk-type game" to a game of stick and hoop played using interactive fiction mechanics. All of this is summarised as "brain poison for your brain poison", which describes a lot of the art I like.</p>
<p><a href="https://june-flower.itch.io/amphora-hell">You can download Amphora Hell for free on Itch</a>. If you get past the floating head stage, do let me know if there's anything weirder to report, and by all means share any of your own projects you now wish to destroy with flying hammers.

            <p>I tend to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> closer to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> than a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>. Balance? Leave me alone, for I am immersed in the stinky fantasy of being a sniveling Skaven bin-licker, commanding my slaves to mine useless gold purely because it irritates my dwarfish enemies.</p>
<p>As such, I'm not quite as tuned into the nuances of enemy faction behaviour as a lot of players, despite my ungodly hour count. I do miss fighting against large enemy empires though, something the AI seems more reluctant to pull off these days. Creative Assembly seem to think so, too. <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/65">A new blog post</a> outlines the changes they're making to AI, and there's an <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/forums/72-campaign-ai-beta/threads/8980-how-to-download-the-campaign-ai-beta-on-steam">experimental beta branch available </a>right now if you want to test them out.</p>

<p>There's a fair bit of design talk in the blog, so I'll stick to the helpful "How will this affect you in-game?" explainers they've given. They're looking at three major areas in all: 'Query System', 'Aggression', and 'Faction Potential'.</p>
<p>The query system is how the AI detects enemies and potential enemies on the map. So, anyone who isn't them basically, given that it's Warhammer. The problem? Campaign AI prioritises defending its settlements when enemy forces are present, and 'enemy forces' hitherto included even the lowliest agent character. They're now making the enemy less likely to cower behind their walls at the merest whiff of a rambling troubadour weaving daisy chains on adjacent farmland. From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>"How will this affect you in-game? It means an AI controlled faction will no longer immediately assume a defensive posture and concentrate forces near/in settlements whenever any hostile agent ventures into their territory. This should enable AI factions to use resources that previously went to the defensive response for other purposes, e.g. raiding enemy territories, concentrating forces to break through defended positions."</p></blockquote>
<p>They're also aiming to make the AI better at assessing rival faction's strength, and more incentivised to declare war on other AI factions. I sort of love how vaguely sinister the word 'incentivise' is in this context, since its basically flipping a switch in someone's head that makes them angrier (which I seem to remember being the <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Angron">actual lore behind a Warhammer 40k character</a>, actually.)</p>
<p>Finally there's 'faction potential', which basically governs how powerful a given faction is likely to grow. If you've noticed certain Dark Elves performing absurdly well in <em>every single campaign</em>, it's likely to do with their high potential. From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We’ve made five tweaks to Faction Potential for this Beta:</p>
<ul>
<li>A slight increase of major AI faction strength versus minor AI factions</li>
<li>Slight increase of faction potential weight in auto resolve calculations</li>
<li>Lowered the minimum faction potential minor factions can have</li>
<li>Moderately increased the maximum faction potential bonus for AI factions under the shroud - this allows higher potential factions to defeat and conquer lower potential factions faster</li>
<li>Small increase of base faction potential for all factions on all difficulty levels"</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This should mean that major factions conquer the little guys faster and more often, increasing the chance they'll survive until late game, and also be less passive overall.</p>
<p>This can obviously change between campaigns, but here's <a href="https://youtu.be/EYLHQwGffHg">a quick timelapse</a> by YouTuber MonkeyBot of a campaign in the current beta. The Bloody Hands orcs seem to do a lot better than usual, and the Skaven don't usually do quite as well in my experience either. Also, the Ordertide has been well and truly krumped.</p>
<p>Will I be jumping in to try these changes any time soon? No. I have work to do and showers to take regularly, both of which will suffer horribly if I'm not careful. You should be careful, too. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3s-ai-playing-smart-in-forge-of-the-chaos-dwarfs-is-as-miserable-as-it-is-brilliant">Good Twarhammer AI can be horrible</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you’ve got children that have grown out of the Gruffalo but still like to be read a story at night, chances are you know about Dog Man. A series of books from Dav Pilkey, Dog Man is a dog, who’s also a policeman, who takes part in a host of silly adventures in his superhero alter-ego, The Bark Knight.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dog Man: Mission Impawsible - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toJ0IOjJVKQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dog Man has reached that hallowed ground of popularity and ubiquity that have earned him an upcoming cinematic debut, but Dog Man fans can already join him in Dog Man: Mission Impawsible, a platforming adventure featuring all his friends. It’s an old-school tie-in platformer, and while it’s relatively simple, younger fans will absolutely get a kick out of the artwork and spending time with their favourite characters.</p>


<p>Piggie – a bad guy who happens to be an actual pig – along with his cohorts, Bub and Crunky, are causing bother in the city, and it’s up to Dog Man and his Supa Buddies to save the day. They’re going to do that by jumping across platforms, hopping on bad guys’ heads, and making their way through the occasionally tricky levels from left to right, and while it isn’t Mario, it’s mechanically sound and offers enough variety to keep you entertained through the game’s runtime.</p>


<p>Much of that variety comes from being able to switch between Dog Man and his two companions, 80-HD and Lil’ Petey. Besides being able to jump different distances, or fit through different-sized spaces, they all have special abilities that you’ll need to employ to make it to the end of each level, their talents growing as you progress. It’s easy to grasp, and the younger gamer in our house could easily recognise the various points that needed a specific character to get past.</p>
<p>That said, Dog Man: Impawsible Mission can be tricky for younger fingers and thumbs. My youngest is 8 years old, and while we aimed to take turns doing levels, he often passed the controller back to me mid-stage because it was proving frustrating. That’s in part due to some jumps needing to be much more precise than others, while the characters’ different heights injects a spot of trial and error. We overcame all those mild frustrations together, but if your child isn’t a regular platformer fan, prepare to be their in-house Supa Buddy.</p>

<p>Dog Man: Impawsible Mission definitely looks the part, with bright and vibrant visuals that look as though they’ve been pulled straight from the books. There’s also artwork to unlock that showcases some of the storyboarding from the books, or highlights key moments in the game, but these are made slightly less interesting by the inability to zoom in closer, or to blow them up to full screen.</p>

			<p>Ever dreamed of getting into The Elder Scrolls VI as an NPC (non-player character)? Well, here's your chance, courtesy of Bethesda Game Studios and Make-A-Wish: <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction?linkId=100000340468689" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there's an ongoing silent auction</a> to make this specific dream come true.</p>
<p><em>One winner will have the opportunity to work with the Bethesda Game Studios development team to create a character to appear as a video game NPC in The Elder Scrolls VI.</em></p>
<p><em>Calling all gamers and fantasy fans! This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows you to immortalize yourself in one of the most highly anticipated video games of all time, The Elder Scrolls VI. The Elder Scrolls series, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is renowned for its vast open worlds, deep lore, and immersive storytelling. With this exclusive experience, you'll work with the developers to create a custom character that will appear in the game, leaving your mark on the legendary franchise.</em></p>
<p>The only issue is that, well, the auction is already well beyond the means of any regular gamer. Right now, the bid is at $10.5K, and it's bound to get higher—it was at $7.1K just yesterday. There's no publicly listed end date, though one would assume you'd get notified about that kind of information after making a bid. Also, this is only available for United States residents.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have covered someone getting into The Elder Scrolls VI as an NPC. Back in November 2018, fans of the fantasy RPG franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/fans-bethesda-shirley-curry-npc-tesvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petitioned</a> Bethesda to add 'Granny' Shirley Curry, who had become beloved in the community after her YouTube videos of playing Skyrim. A few months later, Bethesda officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-elder-scrolls-vi-or-starfield-e3-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that they had already scanned Curry to make her an NPC in the game. Meanwhile, modders have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-is-now-available-in-game-through-a-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> her to Skyrim.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls VI was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at E3 2018 when Bethesda wanted to reassure fans about its commitment to single-player games following the unveiling of Fallout 76. It only <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered production</a> around the launch of Starfield, in August 2023. The likely launch window is between late 2027 and 2028.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> was a heady mixtape of nostalgia for me. It brings Don't Nod's narrative strengths of young adult melodrama and magical realism into an era I lived through. A story about four young women sharing a pivotal summer in the year of 1995.</p>

<p>It is a spot-on punk rock time capsule full of flawed characters, a mesmerizing pop soundtrack, and young adult angst. However, due to how Don't Nod has decided to present this tale, it is difficult for me to fully recommend this intimate adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-swann-on-bed.jpg?itok=hF1KLRmD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-swann-on-bed.jpg?itok=k4oLzLZT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The old days of rental stores and rewinding cassettes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> Tape 1 Review – My So-Called Life</h2>

<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> starts with Swann Holloway, a woman returning to her childhood home of Velvet Cove after receiving a text from some old friends. After reconnecting at a local bar, her friends slowly remember the first time they met twenty-seven years ago and a haunting incident that has reunited them in the present.</p>

<p>Those friends include Autumn, a girl with a summer job and a jerk for a boss, Kat, a quiet but observant bundle of anger in overalls, and Nora, an acne-scarred defiant rocker with a turbulent home life.</p>

<p>This framing device, while familiar, does a great job of suspense. It's the basis for various coming-of-age stories like <em>Stand By Me</em>. The flashback structure adds a level of suspense to the entire story, the knowledge that something major or devastating will happen in the future. This is a studio that doesn't shy away from emotional gut-punches, and that unease hangs over the entire narrative.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-case.jpg?itok=nlrgg0LB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-case.jpg?itok=-crGXONb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The minute I saw this I turned to dust and immediately wanted to hang out with Swann.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> Tape 1 Review – Gotta Get With My Friends</h2>

<p>It's a clever set-up since the pacing of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is far more sedate. Like most narrative-centric experiences, gameplay involves moving Swann through several locations, choosing dialogue options that either build (or destroy) relationships with certain characters and occasionally solving a puzzle. The closest point of comparison would be another Don't Nod drama, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tell-me-why-episode-3-spoilers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>. You have some authorship over Swann's character, but the draw is more on character drama than plot logistics.</p>

<p>The closest thing to a major mechanic is Swann's camcorder. At any point in the game, you can pull it out and record snippets of video. Record enough of a certain object or phenomenon and you'll make a Memoir, a sort of montage of your footage. There are even sections in Swann's bedroom where you can watch the footage you shot up to that point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-camcorder-footage.jpg?itok=7jsYceGY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-camcorder-footage.jpg?itok=QTMtE6aL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I did a double-take when I first used this. The effect is perfect.</figcaption></figure><p>It's a small but wonderful way of characterizing Swann through gameplay. Recording every bird, squirrel, or beautiful skyline isn't just for completionism but illustrates Swann's interests. Her friends even encourage or chide her for it in certain scenes.</p>

<p>As the story of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> unfolds, the vibe is less Stephen King or Hitchcock and more <em>The Donnas</em> or <em>Bikini Kill</em>. From the minute you play as teenage Swann, it is clear Don't Nod did their research into the 90s era.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every time you use Swann's camcorder, there's a noticeable analog filter over the lens. The shelf is packed with boxy VHS cassette tapes and thick potboiler novels. She even has a troll doll and an off-brand Tamagotchi on her desk. But the best atmospheric touch is the music: a moody blend of dreampop mixed with riot grrl punk rock. When it comes to depicting the look and feel of the 1990s, this game comes off ace.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-playground.jpg?itok=3PP7wEpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-playground.jpg?itok=pnsze4hl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hanging out at night. It happened more often than you think.</figcaption></figure><p>This underground attitude extends to Swann's friends. They play in a garage band, aptly titled <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, openly smoke, and complain about things in their personal life&nbsp;- complaints like distant or deadbeat fathers, annoying sisters, and how to get out of their dead-end small town.</p>

<p>Complimenting this is dialogue that walks the razor's edge of adolescence and awkwardness. Writing convincing dialogue is difficult for young adults, the first <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/life-is-strange-remastered" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Life is Strange</em></a> was particularly hit-and-miss, but it's clear the narrative team here did their research. The dialogue isn't just believable, it is couched in the era.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-adult-autumn.jpg?itok=3yIaptJD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-adult-autumn.jpg?itok=3EaQcDxz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Good question, Autumn. Good question.</figcaption></figure><p>The countercultural attitude isn't just the characters putting on airs but a part of the girl punk cultural movement that started in the mid-90s. The disdain for authority isn't just friction against parental systems, but an extension of social awareness of institutional problems. As angry and juvenile as the main cast can get, they have layers.</p>

<p>The present-day sections further contrast this atmosphere. While brief, these interludes do a great job of framing the characters' yearning for the past. A past not inundated with smartphones, social media, or recovering from a devastating global plague. The game even keeps track of your relationships between certain characters in the present and the past; further cementing the effect of time on people and memory. There is some rose-tinted nostalgia here, but it is more wistful than romantic.</p>

<p>While the vibes of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> are immaculate, I can't fully recommend the game on them alone. There are some technical issues. Uncanny robotic facial animations and out-of-sync lip flaps kept distracting me during certain parts. There is some tell-don't-show going on regarding certain character dynamics. For example, Nora's dysfunctional home is alluded to in the montage and mentioned but not illustrated.</p>

<p>But the biggest hurdle is pacing. The lion's share of this game were several small scenes intercut with montages of small-town life, a nature walk through the woods, some quasi-horror segments, and a big rock-and-roll performance. The closest thing to stakes isn't life or death or confiding in a dark secret but helping a character find a set of lost keys. If you think plot and narrative momentum are central to an experience, chances are you'll be bored or frustrated by this.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is currently an incomplete story. There is an inciting incident and a big cliffhanger twist near the end. It's a twist that gets better the more I think about it, but that lack of closure does sour the experience; even if that closure arrives in a few months.</p>

<h2><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> <em>Tape 1</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While it only tells half a story and has some technical jank, <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> retains the quirks and the charm of Don't Nod's previous outings. As awkward and occasionally embarrassing as Swann and her friends can be, their story is a melancholic and human one. And if you know you'll need to wait for the ending, I say give this a look.</p>

<p>According to a new report, Rockstar Games plans to make GTA 6 a new “metaverse platform” for user-generated content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digiday</a> reports that Rockstar has spoken to some of the best user-generated creators for Roblox, Fortnite, and GTA for their upcoming title, GTA 6. According to the report and three anonymous industry insiders, the developers are exploring the possibility of creating custom experiences in the game, which will allow these creators to introduce their intellectual property to GTA 6’s world while having the ability to alter the existing elements of the game, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fans will appreciate user-generated content in GTA 6 after seeing how well GTA RP servers have done for a game released over a decade ago. Thanks to the user-generated content players experience in the GTA RP servers, GTA 5 remains one of the most popular games on Steam and is followed massively on Twitch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, in 2023, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fivem-redm-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar had acquired Cfx.re</a>, which brought two of the biggest role-playing communities under its umbrella, FiveM and RedM. At the time, it was speculated that this move would allow GTA 6 to feature role-playing servers at launch or might get them soon after release; however, the developers never confirmed this information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsairs-ceo-believes-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-early-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corsair’s CEO believes</a> GTA 6 will come to PC early next year. Also, GTA 6 release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-may-not-be-the-end-for-gta-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be the end</a> for GTA online.

            <p>If you are one of the many eagerly awaiting Elder Scrolls 6 - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">first announced all the way back in 2018</a> - well, I am sorry to say I don't have a release date for you <em>just </em>yet.

<p>The upcoming Elder Scrolls 6 has been long in the pipeline. As I've already said, it was first announced over six years ago. At the time of its reveal, Bethesda was keen to make sure everyone knew Elder Scrolls 6 was still a way out, and said it was in pre-production (although we do know it will be released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">before Fallout 5</a>). Then, back in 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-in-design-phase-being-built-on-new-starfield-technology">Bethesda said Elder Scrolls 6 was in a design phase</a>.</p>
<p>The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Todd Howard has since said he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>"But I'm betting you won't hear much in the way of details until a good six months before release," Nesmith said at the time.</p>
<p>So, do you fancy turning yourself into an Elder Scrolls 6 NPC?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has announced it will discontinue its Gold Points scheme across the Switch eShop and official Nintendo website.</p>
<p>From 25th March 2025, players will no longer be able to earn Gold Points from purchases. Points earned before this date will still be usable.</p>
<p>Gold Points are currently earned through purchases on the eShop or official Nintendo website, essentially like a loyalty scheme, and can then be redeemed for a discount.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for digital games made up to and including 24th March 2025 will still earn Gold Points, regardless of the game's release date (even if payment occurs after this date). Points will not be granted if the pre-order is cancelled, or if payment fails. Pre-orders after this date will not earn points.</p>
<p>Gold Points can still be earned by registering physical games, as long as the game was released by 24th March 2025 (as shown on the eShop). Gold Points can be earned up to two years from a game's original release date in Europe (one year in other countries).</p>
<p>Lastly, Gold Points are valid for 12 months from the date of being earned, expiring at the end of a calendar month. That means Gold Points earned up to and including 24th March can be used to receive a discount on the eShop for another year.</p>
<p>It's unclear why Nintendo is ending this scheme, with the <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83">announcement</a> simply stating: "We sincerely thank you for using the My Nintendo rewards programme, and apologise for any inconvenience."</p>
<p>Perhaps Nintendo will be switching to a new equivalent scheme for Switch 2 and is ending Gold Points in advance?</p>
<p>In similar news, Nintendo has stated <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers</a> cannot be redeemed for Switch 2 exclusive games.</p>
<p>These vouchers are available for players with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, allowing them to purchase two games from a select list at a discounted price, including various Nintendo exclusive games.</p>
<p>"Please note that Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers cannot be redeemed for Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games," the purchase page now reads.</p>
<p>Again, it's unclear what Nintendo's plans are here for Switch 2, but change is definitely afoot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo unveiled its Switch 2</a> last month, along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">brand new Mario Kart</a>.

			<p>Yesterday, Arc System Works announced the launch date of its upcoming game HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT: July 17. This will be the first fighting game based on Yoshihiro Togashi's manga and anime franchise and the first game from the IP to be released globally.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now open digitally on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/JP0036-PPSA24274_00-0000000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456420/HUNTERxHUNTER_NENxIMPACT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, with Switch digital pre-orders set to open later. Players who pre-order the Deluxe Edition will earn a 48-hour Early Access before release and a special color variation for Killua (PS5) and Hisoka (PC). Players who preorder the Nintendo Switch version will receive a special color for Gon.</p>
<p>The retail edition will only be released for PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch in two versions: Standard and Limited Edition. The latter will include the following items:</p>

<p>At launch, HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT includes sixteen characters from various arcs of the 2011 anime adaptation of the series. The first DLC character will be Nephelpito from the Chimera Ants arc. Players will be able to obtain Nephelpito by either purchasing the DLC separately or by buying the Deluxe version of the game. He is also the first character (out of four) available in Season Pass 1, set to be released in Winter 2025.</p>
<p>Offline modes include Free Battle, Training mode (which allows players to practice with their characters in any situation, also coming with various settings and a “Record” function), a Replay section that allows players to rewatch their favorite matches, and the Story mode that gives the opportunity to relive famous scenes from HUNTERxHUNTER and play against the CPU based on set situations. Some stages also act as tutorials to help players understand how to play on top of enjoying the 2011 anime’s iconic moments.</p>
<p>The Single mode, on the other hand, provides a variety of challenges, including the “Sky Arena” featuring a series of matches against the CPU to become the “Floor Master”. Each character also comes with a “Combo Trial”, which will challenge players to perform several combos.</p>
<p>The Story and Single modes also serve to collect “Titles,” “Profile Icons,” and Greed Island Cards - G.I. Cards - to fill your Collection and help you personalize your profile online.</p>
<p>The multiplayer supports a quality rollback netcode. Online modes include Player Matches, which are meant for casual fun, and Ranked Matches, where players can try to become “Triple Hunter”, accumulating Rank Points and scoring as high as possible. Both modes also allow players to challenge each other to gain G.I. Cards.</p>
<p>HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT was included in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated fighting games of 2025</a>, so look forward to our review in due time.</p>
