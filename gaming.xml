<p>Running 24-hours a day from 30th June to 6th July in Minnesota – and broadcast across the world on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Games Done Quick's Twitch channel</a> – the in-person event was "filled with delightful moments", including everyone's favourite pup <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-the-moment-peanut-butter-becomes-the-first-dog-speedrunner-in-agdq-2024">Peanut Butter</a> playing Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>"The crowd roared at every successful pitch and bat, did the wave, and sang their hearts out with ball game chants," the SGDQ team said. "Other highlights were a coordinated dance of Herald of Darkness during Alan Wake 2 and a musical performance during the 1991 Western classic Sunset Riders."</p>
<p>Crowds gathered physically and virtually for speedy runs of other games like Elden Ring, Minecraft Dungeons, Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain, Halo 3, Old School Runescape, Evil Zone, and "much, much more".</p>

        <p>"Fight for the truth, awaken your resolve, and enter the tournament for the throne."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sega has dropped a fresh trailer for Atlus' new RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p>Revealed at a panel at this weekend's Anime Expo 2024, the new teaser gives "viewers an early peek at the turbulent events that kickstart the player’s journey in Metaphor: ReFantazio". You can check it out below:</p>

<p>The video description simply says: "Fight for the truth, awaken your resolve, and enter the tournament for the throne."</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio focuses on a young protagonist drawn into a magical election when the world's king dies. Any person of any social status can become the next king by gaining support of the population, leading to a world-spanning adventure and battle for the throne.</p>
<p>Players will be able to battle in real time with attacks and dodges, which ensures field exploration is dynamic and should make grinding quicker, but turn-based combat remains for traditionalists, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11, 2024</a> on PC via Steam/Windows, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and last-gen consoles. Physical and digital pre-orders are available now.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to be a "culmination of our RPGs", said director Katsura Hashino, following the studio's work on the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. Its release marks the 35th anniversary of Atlus' first game. Hashino explained more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-fantasy-election-adapts-personas-social-gameplay">Metaphor's fantasy setting and election twist on familiar Persona gameplay</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/07/metaphor-refantazio-trailer-showcases-why-you-should-get-excited-for-this-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Has there ever been a better time to be an RPG fan? Genre aficionados are eating exceptionally well these days, and Metaphor: ReFantazio is nestling on the horizon with the potential to be the next essential purchase for those in the know. Adding to that hype, ATLUS have released an all-new story trailer at the Anime Expo 2024 panel, offering fans an early peek at the turbulent events that kickstart the player’s journey in Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Story Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5IWiqGKcQg?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Today’s Anime Expo panel contained exciting new game details. Metaphor: ReFantazio’s Director Katsura Hashino and Character Designer Shigenori Soejima provided the packed hall with details on the game’s setting, characters, monsters and more. For those in the know, one of the reasons that Metaphor ReFantazio is such a big deal is that these are the creators of Persona 3, 4 and 5, arguably three of the most genre-defining RPGs of the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>You can definitely see that lineage in the visual and character design, with a similarly captivating anime-esque strand carryies through in both the animated cutscenes and in the moment to moment gameplay. There’s an interesting mix of real-time and turn-based aspects to the combat, and it all looks thoroughly enthralling at this point, and that’s before we even know how it all comes together.</p>
<p>Early tomorrow morning, ATLUS will also share details from the panel in a special “ATLUS Exclusive” Showcase – Story livestream on the ATLUS West YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@atlus">https://www.youtube.com/@atlus</a>) and Steam. A recording of the actual AX panel will also be available for viewing at a later date on the ATLUS West YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11, 2024 on Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Steam. Physical and digital pre-orders are available now. For more information and for links to pre-order, visit metaphor.atlus.com. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on this one as we get closer to launch!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-is-working-on-an-unannounced-remake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>2K is working on an unannounced remake.</p>
<p>That's according to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-shupe-45aa09170/">LinkedIn page</a> (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-2k-working-on-unannounced-remake">MP1st</a>) of a motion capture animator who has been working at 2K for the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Among the games you'd expect to see on the resume of a developer working at 2K Games – 2K25 WWE, NBA 2K25, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">upcoming Mafia game</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-game-lands-far-cry-and-ghost-of-tsushima-writer-as-narrative-lead">highly-anticipated new BioShock game</a>, to name but a few – there are also references to two unannounced games (one is a sports title) and an "unannounced upcoming remake".</p>

<p>Whilst it's not unusual for a studio with such a storied catalogue to be remastering or remaking classic games for current-gen systems, news of an "unannounced remake" has some players incredibly excited, not least BioShock fans.</p>
<p>It's been almost ten years since the BioShock trilogy was remastered, and there's plenty of appetite for a reworking of the first BioShock game, widely regarded as one of the best video games ever made.</p>
<p>But that's not all. 2K is also home to the Sid Meier games and Spec-Ops: The Line, another cult classic admired for its storytelling, so there's several games 2K could have pulled from the vault. Watch this space, eh?</p>
<p>ICYMI, BioShock creator Ken Levine is still not done with follow-up project Judas. But the game is inching closer, evidenced recently by its appearance in trailers and now, a marketing beat where select people such as Game Awards host Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">have now played it for a number of hours</a>.</p>
<p>On the surface, this is a BioShock game in all but name, with gunplay and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And this is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">essentially what trailers</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">shown us of the game so far</a>.</p>

            <p>Manor Lords' publisher has hit back at claims the game is an "interesting case study in the pitfalls of early access", stating that assuming games can continue "endless growth" "causes so much trouble in the games industry".</p>
<p>Responding to a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215487585094094848/">LinkedIn</a> from Hinterland CEO Raphael van Lierop, Tim Bender – who heads up publisher Hooded Horse – responded with a lengthy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tim-hooded-horse_manor-lords-is-a-pretty-interesting-case-study-activity-7215509660999503874-5CO0/">post</a> of their own, suggesting that "if this industry is to find a more sustainable path forward, we need to move away from takes like [this]".</p>

<p>"This is exactly the kind of distorted endless growth/burden of expectations/line must go up perspective that causes so much trouble in the games industry," Bender wrote.</p>
<p>"Manor Lords just sold 250,000 copies in the last month – after selling over 2 million copies in its first three weeks – and has a Very Positive review rating of 88 percent with a median playtime of 8 hours 48 minutes per player (very long for any game, especially a recently released one).</p>
<p>"Players are happy, the developer is happy, and we as publisher are thrilled beyond belief."</p>
<p>"And yet here we are – Manor Lords is apparently a 'case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access' because the 'game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches' (one of the patch notes being called 'small' here runs over 3,000 words and over 10 single-spaced pages) leading to 'CCUs have plummeted since launch' (yes, we didn't maintain the 173,000 concurrent player peak) and the apparently dark reality that some people, after enjoying their purchase of a premium, single-player title, might decide to go on and play another game (The horror! The horror!)."</p>
<p>Bender goes on to say that before Manor Lords was released, they "had a chat" with its solo developer, Greg Styczeń.</p>
<p>"I told him that after release, he was going to hear from all sorts of commenters talking about missed opportunities because he failed to grow as fast as they wanted, and judging the game a failure by some kind of expectation they formed. I told him to ignore all that – to focus on his core vision for the game, and to keep in mind that the Early Access road is long and that he should not feel any sense of pressure from the expectations of others – for both his own health and stress levels over the coming years and for preserving the state of calm and peaceful mind that supports his creative vision.</p>
<p>"If this industry is to find a more sustainable path forward, we need to move away from takes like [this]," Bender concluded. "Success should not create an ever-raising bar of new growth expectations.</p>
<p>"Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust. And a release should not begin an ever-accelerating treadmill on which devs are forced to run until their mental or physical health breaks down."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-patch-makes-experimental-changes-to-tweak-balance-and-reduce-ale-consumption">A number of "experimental" changes were recently</a> made to Manor Lords to tweak the balance, including reduced ale consumption.</p>
<p>The update fixes a number of commonly reported issues, including "None" people spawning and not working; the game being stuck at the summary screen after a victory; weak archer damage; and overly high ale consumption.</p>

            <p>XDefiant producer Mark Rubin has told players it's "okay to move on" if the game "isn't for you", but disputed claims the game was "rushed out" to avoid releasing at the same time as other big games.</p>
<p>Responding to an X/Twitter post in which a fan suggested the shooter was "rushed out because of GTA 6 and Call of Duty Black Ops 6", Rubin – who has previously worked on Call of Duty games – was quick to refute the claim, saying: "Rushed out? No".</p>
<p>"What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO," Rubin said. "And so all of the infrastructure for an FPS has had to be built up from the ground floor. Even CoD started on ID tech which was a shooter engine. Apex started on a shooter engine.</p>

<p>"But for us we are working on developing all new tech in an engine that was designed for something else."</p>
<p>After saying that the engine XDefiant uses is "really great but does require a lot of work", Rubin then acknowledged that as the engine hadn't been designed for shooters, "with that work comes a lot of bugs".</p>
<p>"The engine is really great, but it does require a lot of work and with that work comes a lot of bugs that other engines have already worked out," Rubin said.</p>
<p>"We're not a shooter that's been out for 20 years. If you like what we are trying to do stick around and you'll see things improve and new features get added. But if the game isn't for you that's ok you can move on."</p> <div>

<p>Ubisoft's Tom Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter XDefiant finally launched for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 21st May, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-due-to-console-certification-issues">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">delays</a>. It was initially revealed as Tom Clancy's XDefiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-ghost-recon-and-the-division-merge-in-ubis-6v6-free-to-play-fps-xdefiant">back in 2021</a>, but Ubisoft later announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-drops-tom-clancys-name-from-xdefiant">dropping the prefix</a> following criticism from Tom Clancy fans who felt XDefiant's flamboyant action strayed too far from the franchise's more serious military themes.</p>

And while the <em>Starter Edition </em>is the full version of the game with zero restrictions, there is one major drawback to purchasing it: <strong>The </strong><em><strong>Starter Edition</strong></em><strong> requires a subscription to play after 30 days.</strong> Notably, the <em>Free Trial</em> does not. - Simon Mackinley Estey <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85cd8126426ef8096be52d7ffd1ab8f7" data-recommend-id="image://85cd8126426ef8096be52d7ffd1ab8f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Tarnished One sits upon his steed in a field of wild flowers, contemplating the final season of Moonlighting, and how that show never received the credit it deserved for how it broke the fourth wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished One sits upon his steed in a field of wild flowers, contemplating the final season of Moonlighting, and how that show never received the credit it deserved for how it broke the fourth wall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85cd8126426ef8096be52d7ffd1ab8f7" data-recommend-id="image://85cd8126426ef8096be52d7ffd1ab8f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Tarnished One sits upon his steed in a field of wild flowers, contemplating the final season of Moonlighting, and how that show never received the credit it deserved for how it broke the fourth wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Minor Erdtree Incantation can only be found in <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span> expansion.

<p>As the Esports Trade Association hosts the EsportsNext 2024 expo in Chicago, the city’s mayor has declared today, July 7, ‘Esports Day in Chicago’. The Esports Trade Association is an organisation focused on the advancement and regulation of the esports industry, working through several programs and initiatives to spread awareness, raise support, and organise events.</p>



<p>In an official proclamation, Mayor Brandon Johnson announced that today, Chicago’s people will celebrate Esports Day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unprecedented-support">Unprecedented Support</h2>



<p>Governments worldwide are becoming more receptive to the concept of esports or competitive gaming. Some nations are developing faster than others – the United States has a strong collegiate system that’s seeing thousands of students participate in esports programs, for example. In South Korea, the esports scene has been ramping up over several years, with the nation driving the way in the construction of esports stadiums and facilities.</p>



<p>In Chicago, the Office of the Mayor has now declared a full-fledged day to represent the growth and power of the esports industry. Hours ago, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-davidson-42953846_dlcdrop-esports-gaming-activity-7215678908430438401-tbNN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Brandon Johnson released a statement</a> to showcase this new day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Chicago-based Esports Trade Assocaition brings together the most talented and visionary members of the esports community to unify the local esports sector, and is committed to building an inclusive and supportive environment that cultivates sustainable growth for all.</p>



<p>I, Brandon Johnson, Mayor of the City of Chicago, do hereby proclaim July 7, 2024, as ESPORTS DAY IN CHICAGO, recognising this premier event and urging all residents to champion our esports and tech ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a wonderful thing to behold. Once upon a time, the concept of competitive gaming was scoffed at, now it’s a multi-billion-dollar industry with thousands of competitors and millions of fans worldwide. In some ways, it’s starting to seriously rival traditional sports.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-will-go-back-to-its-original-loot-system-for-black-ops-6-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.920832/</guid>

<p>A Call of Duty leaker has claimed that Call of Duty Warzone will be moving away from the Warzone 2-era of its backpack system for its Black Ops 6 integration.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@BobNetworkUk</a>, who claimed Warzone will return to its original loot system. The leaker has also revealed that Wildcards will be added to Loadouts in Warzone.</p>



<p>Earlier in June, Bob revealed that Warzone’s original map, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Verdansk, will be delayed until 2025</a>, a rumor that Insider Gaming has corroborated. </p>



<p>If the latest rumors are true, it suggests that Activision’s strategy for the next couple of years is to continue capitalizing on nostalgia. For Call of Duty 2025, codenamed Saturn, it’s understood that the game will see the return of classic Black Ops 2 maps. It’s currently unclear, though on whether or not they will return to the extent we say with Modern Warfare 3 and the MW2 (2009) maps.</p>



<p>Bob also revealed in early June that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-black-ops-6-theatre-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 is set to see the return of Call of Duty Theatre Mode</a>, which was a great feature in the older Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25, 2024, for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. It’s believed that Call of Duty will be coming to Nintendo platforms at some point after its release in 2025.</p>

		<p>Inbetweengames has announced that it has made its tech-noir tactics title All Walls Must Fall free to download on Steam and itch.io, and that this is a permanent move. It has not been made free on Switch. The game first released six years ago, placing players in a 2089 Berlin in an alternate universe where the Cold War never thawed. All Walls Must Fall has a further unique setting in that many of its procedurally generated levels are set within Berlin’s gay club scene, where the battle to avert nuclear war plays out.</p>
<p><iframe title="All Walls Must Fall - Coming Out Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Zc77HwYflI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The download links for All Walls Must Fall are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/628290/All_Walls_Must_Fall__A_TechNoir_Tactics_Game/">All Walls Must Fall – A Tech-Noir Tactics Game on Steam (steampowered.com)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://inbetweengames.itch.io/awmf/devlog/760809/all-walls-must-fall-is-now-free">All Walls Must Fall is now FREE! – All Walls Must Fall by inbetweengames (itch.io)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In a post, Isaac, David and Rafal of Inbetweengames wrote, <em>“That’s right – the game is now completely free for everyone! It’s been 6 years since we released All Walls Must Fall, and we’ve decided that we’d love if everyone who always wanted to play but never quite got around to buying it has the opportunity. So it’s now totally free on Steam and itch.io! We hope you enjoy playing our tech-noir tactics game that we made. We put a lot of our hearts into it, and while we’ve all moved on to other projects now, that time we made our own little indie game will always be special to us.”</em></p>
<p>All Walls Must Fall has procedurally generated levels within which players carefully lay out and execute plans, through a mix of real-time and simultaneous turn-based gameplay. Time manipulation is one of the tools available to players, allowing actions to be rewound if the outcome is not what was desired. Additionally, the game offers a New Game+ mode, facilitating continuous gear upgrades as challenges progressively intensify in a limitless fashion.</p>


<p>In our All Walls Must Fall review, Steve said, <em>“Unfortunately, I didn’t really enjoy my time with All Walls Must Fall. The fantastic setting, thumping soundtrack and original take on seduction mini-games are not matched by its gameplay mechanics. Everything felt too chaotic and the environments too lacking in variety to maintain my interest. There is probably a solid strategy experience to be found here, but it needs a much clearer focus. The procedurally generated levels just felt out of place to me, lacking the careful design of many other strategy titles. A tabletop version of this setting has the potential to be awesome, but in this medium, All Walls Must Fall just didn’t float my boat.”</em></p>

            <p>Guess what, Tarnished? We've all been saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>'s "Scadutree" incorrectly.</p>
<p>According to VaatiVidya's fascinating video Amazing Secrets in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, <em>scadu</em> is derived from ancient English and is pronounced "sha-doe" rather than "ska-doo"... which, let's face it, makes much more sense given the DLC's subtitle.</p>

<p>"You might have noticed that I've started saying 'Shad-doo-tree" differently in my videos, and that's because I've seen a lot of commentary going around regarding its correct pronunciation," VaatiVidya explained in the video (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/weve-all-been-saying-scadutree-wrong-in-elden-ring-fromsoftware-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"Apparently, the word <em>scadu</em> comes from Old English and means shade or shadow. So this is a shadow tree and it's pronounced… shadutree, or shadowtree.</p>
<p>"It sounds a lot better than saying <em>ska-doo</em> or all the time so I was very happy to be educated on this."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-writer-george-rr-martin-tells-us-nothing-and-everything-about-a-live-action-spin-off">Elden Ring worldbuilding writer George R. R. Martin recently gave his strongest hint yet that the critically acclaimed game may be getting its own "feature film or TV" spin-off</a>.</p>
<p>"Oh, and about those rumours you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on Elden Ring… I have nothing to say. Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumour?"</p>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cut-voice-lines-discovered-for-elden-ring-dlcs-final-boss">cut voice lines have been discovered for Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree's final boss</a>? A dataminer discovered the lines in the game's internal files when comparing English and Japanese dialogue.</p>
<p>The lines themselves don't offer any groundbreaking insight, but it's certainly an interesting decision to cut the lines.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was designed to boost higher in docked mode than its predecessor while maintaining good efficiency in Handheld mode, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Answering a fan question in a recent video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> commented on the console's power efficiency and expected performance, making a comparison with the popular Steam Deck. The YouTuber stated that the console was designed to boost higher than the original Switch while offering better battery life in handheld mode. In handheld mode, the console will run at 5 watts with a fanless cooling solution, whereas in docked mode, it will operate between 15 to 30 watts with an adequate cooling solution for the additional power draw. To provide a comparison, the YouTuber mentioned that, compared to similar 5nm chips from AMD, the Nintendo Switch 2 chip was competitive in efficiency, primarily because it was designed with power efficiency in mind.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Moore's Law is Dead also commented on the Nintendo Switch 2 performance, saying that the console should be able to run every game that runs on Steam Deck, but with some important differences. As the Nintendo's console cores are expected to be not as powerful as those of the Steam Deck's chip, the system is likely not going to run games as well as Valve's system does. A game that runs, for example, at 90 FPS on Steam Deck will likely run at around 60 FPS on the Switch 2, while a game running at 60 FPS on Valve's system will probably run at 40, 45 FPS on the Nintendo console, with VRR to smooth things out. Thanks to the console's GPU and NVIDIA DLSS support, however, the Nintendo system is likely going to run them at higher resolution and likely with some ray tracing as well than on Steam Deck. While this may sound disappointing to people who expected the Nintendo Switch 2 to perform better than the Steam Deck, it will still be a significant improvement over its predecessor, which will be appreciated by all current Nintendo Switch users.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, and it will launch on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. No matter when it launches, Nintendo is going to make sure it will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/">widely available in stores at release.</a></p>

		<p>Japanese RPGs play host to some of the weirdest and wildest ideas, and Neptunia Riders vs. Dogoos is this weekend’s offering. Spinning out of the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, Neptunia Riders vs. Dogoos pops the Neptunia stars onto motorbikes and puts them up against an array of Dogoos, the traditionally pretty rubbish slime creatures that have appeared in every game. Here though, they seem to be morphing into all sorts of other shapes and sizes, including male and female human forms, with dog slime heads. Yep, that’s right. The game already launched in Japan back in DATE, and now Western gamers can sample its delights next year in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos | Announcement Trailer | PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch™" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaSftQiWawc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by Compile Heart, the Hyperdimension Neptunia series has been running since the first game arrived for PlayStation 3 way back in 2010, revolving around the world of Gamindustri. This world is broken up into areas designed to represent different gaming consoles, and originally featured areas based on the Nintendo Wii, PlayStation, Xbox and the cancelled Sega Neptune. Here they’re shifting the series focus, with Uzume Tennoboushi and the Four Goddesses zooming around on motorcycles. Check out the trailer. It’s… interesting.</p>
<p>The Neptunia series has expanded to include a host of spin-offs, with the latest, Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution, sadly not a highlight, only earning a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/neptunia-game-maker-revolution-review/">4/10</a> in our review, with Miguel saying, “Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution is another stinker in a long line of disappointing Neptunia series entries. I love these characters and their world, but this is a flat action-RPG with a barebones management game bolted onto it that do not do them right by any means.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that Neptunia Riders vs. Dogoos is a return to form for the series when it arrives for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in 2025. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on the game in the coming months!</p>
