		<p>Just ahead of the Xbox Tokyo Game Show event at 11AM UK time, Forza Horizon 6 has leaked, confirming that &nbsp;the next entry in the open world racer is heading to Japan, when it launches in 2026.</p>



<p>The teaser shows a number of license plates from the locations that the series has visited in the past, before panning past some Japanese memorabilia and up to reveal Mount Fuji off in the distance.</p>
<p>The leak came from Forza’s own social media accounts, posting the teaser to Instagram almost 12 hours ago, and it’s seemingly appearing as an advert across social streams. With the cat out of the bag – the neko, if you will – it seems they’ve just left it all live.</p>
<p>No word on platform specifics just yet, but the game is definitely coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC at launch, with Xbox Play Anywhere and availability on Game Pass. Whether it’s day and date for PS5 as well, we won’t have to wait too long to find out, I suspect.</p>

<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-switch-2-gyro-controls-confirmed-for-future-update">previously teased gyro mode</a> addition, the update also adds in a brand-new boss, various camera adjustments and a fair share of bug fixes to boot.</p>
<p>What's more, the studios have revealed the new Titanic Scion update roadmap, so we can get an idea of everything on the horizon. It's near-identical to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-roadmap-outlined">the one showcased earlier this month</a>, but it's always nice to know what's in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The free 'Iris Outfit' DLC will still land on 2nd October, followed by more new bosses and cosmetic items on 16th October. The 'Into the Abyss' Expansion Pack will then arrive as a paid add-on in November, before a batch of three bosses land for free in December.</p>

<p>We had a decent enough time with Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion's mech combat when it launched on Switch 2, but felt that the whole thing was sullied by a less than perfect performance. Here's hoping that this update moves things in the right direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards are far from being the most popular game format among users, but they are proving to be way more popular among developers, as they allow them to overcome some of the limitations of traditional cartridges, according to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>



<p>Speaking with German publication <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JP Games</a>, Hamaguchi-san acknowledged why users don't like them, but from a developer's perspective, the discussion on Game-Key cards is much different. This new format allows developers to overcome storage restrictions, as releasing on a Game-Key card allows the developer to overcome the Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges 64 GB limitation.</p>



<p>The biggest issue for developers, especially those making high-end AAA games, is the loading speed of traditional cartridges, which is slower than the speed of solid-state drives. By releasing games on Nintendo Switch 2 in this <em>"semi-download"</em> format, developers can leverage the faster loading speed of the console's internal storage, allowing them to release their AAA games on the system.</p>



<p>While acknowledging how users may not like Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director hopes that, in time, they will come to like them and accept them as part of the culture of gaming on the system. Not only is using them optional for a developer, but it also allows studios to release high-end experiences that may not have hit the system without them.</p>



<p>Since their reveal alongside the system this April, the Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards have been somewhat controversial, especially among those who like actual physical releases. While some developers worked their magic and managed to release their huge AAA games on a regular cartridge, like&nbsp;CD Projekt Red did with Cyberpunk 2077, others made it clear, like Naoki Hamaguchi, that traditional carts have limitations that<span> force them to release their games on Game-Key cards, like in the Star Wars Outlaws case. The open-world game launched on a Game-Key card</span> as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/">Switch 2 cartridges didn't give the performance needed at the quality target the developer was going for.</a></p>

            <p>Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal whipped out their dark shades and finest tactical trench coat at last night's State of Play, announcing that a remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> is set to sneak into our lives early next year. It's a "modernized" version of the classic stealthy and shooty sci-fi sojourn.</p>

<p>The remaster is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3131640/Deus_Ex_Remastered/">set to hit PC on February 5th, 2026</a>. As you can see in the trailer above and as explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/deus-ex-remastered-launches-february-5-on-ps5/">PS blog</a>, it gives the original game a visual facelift that smooths out some of its old school blockiness, with revamped character models that boast "smoother lip-sync animations and ragdoll physics". Elsewhere in visuals department, Aspyr and Eidos have touched up the various environs JC Denton sneaks or shoots through with "reimagined lighting, dynamic shadows, water physics, particle effects, and fully updated textures".</p>
<p>They've also worked in some quality-of-life additions like autosaves, zippier loading times, achievement tracking, and cloud saves "across supported platforms". Rounding things out is revamped support for controllers which "draws inspiration from what Eidos-Montréal pioneered in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> and Mankind Divided" with "refined radial menus, fluid weapon management, and streamlined navigation". Plus, setups with ultrawide or multiple monitors will work out of the gate.</p><p>So, a very remastery remaster. The question is whether it'll be as tempting a purchase for PC folks as I imagine it'll be on console. As of writing, the original Deus Ex's game of the year edition can be grabbed for less than £1/€1/$1 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/Deus_Ex_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/">Steam</a> thanks to a deal running until September 29th. Over on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">GOG.com</a>, it's currently £5.99, but is also part of the platform's preservation program, meaning GOG themselves have made sure it runs as it should on modern hardware.</p>
<p>Add in the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397550/Deus_Ex_Revision/">both</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex_revision_mod">platforms</a> host the Deus Ex Revision mod which offers a substantial fan-made revamp of the game, and it's tough to say whether the £22.49/€26.09/$26.99 that's been stapled to the remaster right now - set to go up to £24.99 and equivalents once it's out - will be that appealing to folks keen for an Extra dose of Deus.</p>
<p>Time will tell if going the full remake route might've been a better call on Aspyr's part, at least from a PC-centric perspective.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> is set to release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and Xbox next January and will come with boost features familiar to players of the Pixel Remasters, known as Streamlined Progression.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed to Eurogamer these boosts will also be coming to the PS5 and PC versions of the game in a future update, though there's no date yet. The PC version's enhanced lighting features will be coming to PS5 too.</p>
<p>As outlined previously in a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch2-xbox-series-x-s">Square Enix blog</a>, players will have access to a new menu where they can implement a number of boosts such as HP full, MP full, Limit gauge full, and maximum damage dealt, which can be toggled individually.</p>

<p>"I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days, as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest," said director Naoki Hamaguchi. "I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p>
<p>"That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamaguchi stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> is "doing very well" on PS5 and PC in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">Automaton</a>, so there's no need to worry about part three.</p>
<p>For its remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, Square Enix decided to create a trilogy. But as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">sales appear to have decreased with each installment</a>, some fans have been worried about the quality of the third game, presuming the company may be keen to move on.</p>
<p>"I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we'll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third installment," said Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>He additionally provided a status update on the project.</p>
<p>"Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely," he said. "A lot of the content is already playable, and the game's direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything."</p><p>For now, the game remains without a release date, but as Remake is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">heading to Switch 2 and Xbox in January</a>, and Square Enix has confirmed the whole trilogy will be coming to both platforms too, the final part presumably won't be released until after then. Perhaps it'll even be a simultaneous multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Indeed, the multiplatform release of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake project will certainly boost sales, helping to counter any decline in sales.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Windows Central</a>, Hamaguchi declared himself an Xbox fan. "I'm going to do my best to make sure that Square Enix can continue to reach a wider audience, including Xbox," he said. "So thank you from me as well."</p>
<p>He also discussed optimising the game for the Xbox Series S, which is notoriously tricky due to its lower specs.</p>
<p>"In terms of hardware specs, I would say the Xbox Series S is actually quite solid in terms of spec," said Hamaguchi. "We didn't come across much of a processing challenge, but many of the challenges were more memory related.</p><p>"Optimisation is something we were strongly cognizant of as we worked on the PC version as well. For Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we took some of the philosophies found in Nanite for Unreal Engine 5 and created our own solution for Unreal Engine 4. We were successful in delivering stable graphics there, and gain Steam Deck verification as well. We have been pretty proud of what we were able to achieve, even on lower spec systems."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has hinted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version">that game may also be headed to Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>Up to 12-players can take part in a match at any one time, though <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001255.000050711.html">according to the official Konami press release</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-will-not-support-cross-play-konami-confirms">crossplay is still not supported</a>.</p>

<p>There are two available game modes: Survival Capture and Survival Intrude. The first is a capture the flag style mode where players must secure a dwindling number of cute green Kerotan, and the latter a battle royale style mode where players must battle over a shrinking play area.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has proven popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-surpasses-a-million-sales-on-launch-day">selling over a million copies on its launch day earlier this month</a>.

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is itself a fantastic recreation of the original game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">In Eurogamer's review</a> it's described as "an achievement for the development team behind Delta too, some of whom were original staff from the Metal Gear Solid 3 team. The legend of Metal Gear Solid 3 has been brought back to life thanks to their efforts, and the experience of playing it has put me in a position I could not have foreseen just a few years ago."</p>

			<p>During yesterday's State of Play, Bandai Namco shared a new Code Vein II trailer that unveiled the game's release date. The sequel to 2019's Soulslike action RPG will release on January 30, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $69.99, the Deluxe Edition priced at $89.99 (including 3-day early access, the Mask of Idris expansion DLC coming in January 2027, and a Custom Outfit Pack with three costume sets and one weapon), and the Ultimate Edition priced at $99.99 with all the above plus a digital mini artbook and soundtrack and a Character Costume Set that comes with six costumes based on characters from the original game.</p>



<p>A Collector's Edition is also exclusively available <a href="https://t.co/9GBTiLv45w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Bandai Namco Store</a>. Priced at $179.99, it gets players all the aforementioned digital bonuses and the following physical goodies:</p>



<ul>
<li>60-page 25x25cm artbook</li>



<li>18cm figurine of character Lou Magmell</li>



<li>Exclusive Steelbook</li>
</ul>



<p>Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced during Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. This sequel builds upon the previous installment's foundation to improve in key areas, as outlined in a new gameplay presentation video that you'll find embedded below.</p>



<p>To begin with, the character creation system is much more robust and detailed than in the original, allowing customization of details such as eyes, hair, scars, and even outfits, hats, masks, and accessories. Being a Soulslike, the combat system is of paramount importance. The developers are evolving it by introducing new weapon types and strategies, such as the bayonet weapon, which blends ranged and melee combat and requires ammunition. The game also retains the core mechanic of building up bleed status on enemies to capitalize with jail attacks, but now the jail weapon types vary more, giving players tactical flexibility tailored to their style. The boss fights promise to be more epic thanks to multi-phase battles and more dynamic enemy abilities. </p>



<p>The companion system was also significantly expanded. In Code Vein II, companions not only fight alongside the player but can even be “assimilated” to provide passive buffs and additional powers. Each companion also has unique abilities, such as Lou, the revenant who can control time.</p>



<p>Narratively, the game introduces a stronger focus on time travel, with the protagonist and companions traveling to the past to save the future. The world exploration also sounds more interactive, with map objects that unlock new areas and crafting mechanics involving consumables like flour for creating buffs and healing items.</p>

			<p>During Sony's September State of Play event, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the final launch date for its long-awaited game Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>The open world action/adventure title will be available starting on March 19, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now across all platforms, with the Standard Edition priced $69.99 and a Digital Deluxe Edition priced $79.99. The latter provides access to some in-game extra cosmetics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kairos Plate Helm</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Gloves</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Boots</li>



<li>Kairos Cloak</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Armor</li>



<li>Balgran Shield</li>



<li>Exclaire Champron</li>



<li>Exclaire Barding</li>



<li>Exclaire Saddle</li>



<li>Exclaire Stirrups</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Deluxe Edition will be available for $10 more and also includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deluxe Edition Limited SteelBook</li>



<li>Map of Pywel</li>



<li>Letter from the Developer</li>



<li>Greymane Brooch Pin</li>



<li>3 Character Photo Cards</li>



<li>3 Patches</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Collector's Edition is priced at $279.99 and adds a stunning 17” Diorama as well as a digital Ultimate Pack that gives players a Tormented Soul Bow, Derictus Spear, Sielos Longsword, Shroud Lantern, and Hyperion Horse Tack Set. All Crimson Desert pre-orders also include the Khaled Shield, and all PS5 pre-orders get the exclusive Grotevant Plate Set. This may be all that remains of t<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hat rumor from two years ago about Pearl Abyss partnering with Sony on the game</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the game's pre-orders opening, Pearl Abyss also updated its <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously shared PC system requirements</a>. The minimum specs are exactly the same, but the recommended specs have been greatly reduced from the previous recommendations of Ryzen 7 7700X / i7-13700K CPU and RTX 4070 SUPER / RX 7800 XT GPU to Ryzen 5 5600 / i5-11600K and RTX 2080 / RX 6700 XT, likely as a result of ongoing optimization. The Steam page also now lists the macOS requirements, which we have reported below:</p>



<p><strong>MINIMUM:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 15<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M1<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics: </strong>M1<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 135 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>RECOMMENDED:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 26<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M4 Pro<br><strong>Memory: </strong>16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> M3 Pro<br><strong>Storage: </strong>150 GB available space</p>



<p>Crimson Desert is powered by the rather impressive proprietary BlackSpace Engine, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have covered in detail in our GDC 2025 report</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The end of the road is finally in sight for the second triple-A game developed by the studio currently known for the MMORPG Black Desert. Crimson Desert was originally announced pre-COVID at G-Star 2019 and even had a Winter 2021 launch window at some point before <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being delayed indefinitely</a>. Initially, the game was meant to feature some MMO-like elements, but it was revamped into a full-fledged single player action/adventure title, which inevitably required a lot of work. </p>



<p>It won't be long before we judge for ourselves whether the change and the wait were worth it. In the meantime, stay tuned for additional Crimson Desert coverage.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is out now, and the series' first foray into Japan features many of its classic staples. This is noticeable early on during the <strong>altar puzzle</strong>, the game's first puzzle sequence you'll encounter. If this early puzzle has you stumped, don't worry, we have the solution right here to help you. Here's how to solve the <strong>Silent Hill f altar puzzle</strong>.</p><h2>Silent Hill f - altar puzzle guide</h2><p>This first puzzle won't be as tricky as some of those you'll encounter later, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-shrine-vault-puzzle-guide/1100-6534872/" data-ref-id="1100-6534872">shrine vault puzzle</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f locker codes</a>, but it may still stump you if you've not noticed a key detail that reveals the answer.</p><p>When you reach the altar, you'll find five stands and five items, or "offerings," before you on plates. It may be immediately apparent that you must place the items in a specific order, but the related poem sure leaves you guessing. The five offerings include a vase, a paper fan, and three dead animals, each of them dressed in some kind of ceremonial wrappings, including a bird, mouse, and fish.</p><p>The alter poem, as confusing as it is, reads:</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p><strong>Altar</strong></p><p>Thy restless heart betrays thee as unfit for this auspicious day.</p><p>Thou must first pay respect to the gods and the spirit of thine ancestors.</p><p>A restless heart leads to a corrupt soul.</p><p>Only through sufficient offerings laid upon many stands may thy soul be cleaned.</p></div><p>If you tried relying on just this poem for the answer, you'd probably have better luck using simple trial and error. It's not very clear at all. Instead, the answer is in the details on the offerings themselves. If you interact with each offering, you'll see that you can spin them. Do so and you'll notice each has a symbol somewhere on them that matches the symbols on one of the altar's stands.</p><p>With this in mind, you simply need to place each offering on the altar that matches its symbol. If you're still stumped, don't fret. Here's the answer, plain as day to help you.</p><h2>Silent Hill f altar puzzle solution</h2><p>From left to right:</p><ol><li>Fan - front left</li><li>Fish - back left</li><li>Vase - front middle</li><li>Bird - back right</li><li>Mouse - front right</li></ol><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367" data-ratio="0.57242063492063" data-width="1008" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill f altar puzzle answer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png"></figure><p>Placing the offerings in this order will immediately solve the puzzle and initiate a cutscene.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Koei Tecmo ups the gameplay ante on its musou Zelda spinoff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2020’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity gave us an expanded look on a time in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s history only whispered about in a few flashback cutscenes. The new Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment seems to be following this trend by taking us even further back in time to the founding of Hyrule and the imprisoning of Ganondorf, of which only fragments were shown in Tears of the Kingdom. Just as Tears expanded on everything Breath of the Wild had to offer, Age of Imprisonment seems to be equally upping the stakes, both in taking advantage of the Switch 2’s increased horsepower and showing off some new and welcome features to the hack ‘n slash spinoff series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo I played (which is now also available to attendees of the Tokyo Game Show) comprised a 10-minute chunk of an early mission that also sought to capitalize on Tears of the Kingdom’s new discoveries: exploring The Depths. Given that this creepy underground area effectively doubled the size of Hyrule, I’m excited to see where these types of missions can lead, and what horrors we’ll find lurking in the dark (I can’t be the only one hoping we get some acknowledgement of the creepy giant statues). This iteration of Hyrule Warriors seemed to run a lot smoother on the Switch 2 and I couldn’t spot any dips in the framerate while wading into combat, but being in an early enclosed area it’s hard to say if Nintendo’s new console was truly being put through its paces.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I began the mission as Zelda, still adjusting to being thrown backwards in time during the events of Tears of the Kingdom, with the ancient Zonai beings Rauru and Minera escorting her toward sacred sites of power hidden away in the Depths. After equipping myself with a few Zonai devices to use in battle, it wasn’t long before I was mowing through enemies in true Dynasty Warriors “musou” style. This time around, Zelda has put down the sheikah slate in favor of a lightsaber, mixing in more straightforward sword slashes with the ability to shoot light arrows from afar, or recall her sword as it dances around to cut swaths through enemies. It’s a great way to make her less of a technical fighter and more of an easy to pick up all-rounder stand-in for Link (who couldn’t make it on account of the whole time travel thing).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zelda has put down the sheikah slate in favor of a lightsaber. It’s a great way to make her less of a technical fighter and more of an easy to pick up all-rounder stand-in for Link.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I was only able to play as three different characters during the demo, I have to hand it to Mineru for stealing the show. Her ability to pull out random complex Zonai death contraptions was something I never got tired of. Whether it was driving a giant spiky four-wheeler of destruction through enemies, or simply hopping onto a giant tire to ride side-saddle instead of running, Mineru has so far proven to be the Green Lantern of this universe with her ability to pull out the wildest creations out of nowhere. Many of her crazier constructs – like summoning a spinning paddle to whack giant orbs into enemies like a bowling ball – had me itching to go back to Tears of the Kingdom to see if I could recreate these death traps myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though only Mineru got to summon complex machines, each character was able to gather singular Zonai devices to be used in battle as consumable items, and deployed in a few ways. At first I was whipping out my flame emitter to mow down groups of little Frox enemies, but later I was able to set one down to continuously burn a Construct Captain while I flanked from the side with more direct attacks, making it an effective 1-2 punch combo. All devices will drain your battery, making their deployment a tactical choice unless you’ve stockpiled battery rechargers. I was only able to mess around with a few, but with different characters using devices in various manners, there’s a lot of room to find great times to deploy them – especially on boss fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with deploying devices, holding R also allows you to activate special unique skills in combat that cover wide areas and blast through the opposition with some bombastic attacks. Each character I got to play had two different abilities, and I was also able to map them alongside Zonai devices for easy use. While they can be used to mow through hordes of grunts, they really shine when facing tougher bosses and captains that stand between you and your objectives. Even the most generic of construct captains can employ strong unblockable attacks that can cover a wide area and do heavy damage, signified by a glowing aura that spreads out from them. Koei Tecmo has seemingly taken a page from another of its action series, Nioh, in presenting the best way to stop an unblockable strike is to overpower it with one of your own. Being able to anticipate, react, and shut down a deadly foe with a trick of my own was immensely satisfying and rewarding (and at least this early on, I was given a pretty generous reaction time before their attack would unleash).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I also appreciate the steps Age of Imprisonment has taken to make your allies feel more tangible, as they are now able to assist you in battle with bigger attacks when you’re running out of skills to deploy. In one instance, a boss readied its charge attack, while both of Zelda’s skills were still on cooldown. Suddenly I was given the option to swap to Rauru waiting on the other side of the arena, and I was able to deploy his unique skill to intercept the boss and save Zelda in a moment that felt truly cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An even bigger upgrade to making more use of your allies is a new ability - a sync strike that can be triggered when you and your ally have dealt enough damage to fill a meter. This lit up their portraits on the side, and also helpfully showed when I was in range of a character to perform the strike with by highlighting the ground to the person in range. Not only are these moves as dramatic as they are powerful, but they’re also unique to the two characters you sync up, opening up the floor for a lot of possibilities and tactics. Pairing up Zelda and Rauru allowed me to shoot out twin beams of light that I could aim independently with each control stick to focus on two bosses at once, while having Zelda synch up with Mineru for a strike let her ride on the back of the Zonai’s mech to wade into battle alternating powerful slams and magic explosions. Given the nature of some of these attacks, I’m really hoping that co-op play will allow each player to direct their own attacks during these sync strikes, though nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though my time with the demo was criminally short, I’m already looking forward to seeing how more of its characters fight in sync – especially the tiny korok musketeer and enigmatic looking Zonai construct that looks very similar to a notably absent hero. Luckily I’ll only have just over a month to wait until Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment arrives on November 6th.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-evolved-into-an-even-better-legend-of-zelda-complement]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here's a new trailer to make up for it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some breaking news from Level-5, with the company today confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> will no longer arrive on the Switch and Switch 2 this year.</p>
<p>This update comes alongside the latest trailer at the Tokyo Game Show. It's now scheduled to arrive at some point in 2026. Here's the <a href="https://www.layton.jp/jouki/en/topics/250925/">official statement via the Layton website</a>, which notes how the team wants to deliver the title in the "best possible form":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LEVEL5 Inc. would like to begin by offering its sincere apologies to all fans who have been looking forward to the release of Professor Layton and the New World of Steam. Although the release was originally scheduled for 2025, in order to deliver the game in the best possible form, the launch has been rescheduled for 2026. We deeply regret any inconvenience this delay may cause and greatly appreciate your understanding and continued support."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the trailer above, you'll be able to hear the "brand-new music composed for this adventure" which also gives fans a "first glimpse of the steam-powered town, Steam Bison, and Layton and Luke's classic back-and-forth".</p>
<p>When we hear more about when exactly this new entry will be releasing for Nintendo's platforms, we'll let you know. This new Professor Layton outing was originally revealed by Level-5 in 2023 and was targeting a 2025 launch until this latest delay.</p>
<p>In some other delay news, 2K Games yesterday announced it would push back the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
