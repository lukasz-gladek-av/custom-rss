            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that a second&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta will be held next month, giving you another chance to check out the next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>The first open beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">took place in November</a>&nbsp;and was so popular that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player count records</a> for the series, despite essentially being a playable demo. No wonder Capcom wants to hold a second beta test.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, this second beta is for players who "were unable to participate the first time or simply wish to play again", so if you did miss the first open beta, now's your chance to check it out once more.</p>

The first starts on February 7th and ends on the 10th, while the second runs between February 14th and 17th.</p>

<p>This second beta will contain all of the content featured in the first test, as well as the chance to take down the returning Gypceros monster, which made its last mainline appearance in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create your character, remake it "as many times as you like", and even design your Palico companion. Naturally, character creation data will also carry over into the full version of the game, and you can use the character you made in the first beta as well.</p>




<p>If you take part in the beta, you can also net yourself some unique rewards for the full game, including a bonus pendant and some extra items.</p>

<p>The second beta period will be held not long before the main game releases;&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.

            <p>Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra</a> chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a> hardware announcements.</p>
<p>No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t bet against the Ryzen 9 9950X3D nabbing the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s crown as the king of gaming CPUs, though whether it (and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D) are actually worth buying will surely come down to price. The 9800X3D is already a super-duper-premium part, and won’t stop bossing games just because something with 24MB more cache comes along, so it could feasibly remain the one to upgrade to if you don’t do the kind of multitasking or media work that would benefit from the added threads.</p><p>AMD’s new handheld processors, also unveiled at CES, are a more diverse bunch. In addition to the Ryzen Z2 and Ryzen Z2 Extreme – direct replacements for the Z1 chips powering handhelds like the Asus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> – there’s also a Ryzen Z2 Go designed for cheaper portables. It’s this modest, 4 core/8 thread part that forms the brain of the $599 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> that also got a CES reveal yesterday.</p>

<p>Curiously, these are a mishmash of various generations of AMD Zen CPU and RDNA graphics tech: the Ryzen Z2 Extreme combines Zen 3 and Zen 5c cores, as well as RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics, while the standard Z2 is built around RDNA 3. The Z2 Go relies on the even older RDNA 2, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s custom AMD APU, so it’ll be interesting to see how the three compare when actually running games. Just don’t expect that to happen on a new Deck version, as Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b">Bluesky</a> to shut down rumours of a Z2-powered Steam Deck successor.</p>

<p>Also curious was the lack of detail AMD gave their other 'big' announcement, the first RDNA 4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">GPUs</a>: the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. No specs, price, release window, nada. They exist. That’s your lot. It took a since-deleted Asus post (well caught, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-might-have-told-us-little-about-its-rdna-4-graphics-cards-but-at-least-we-know-the-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-have-16-gb-of-vram/">PCG</a>) to even let slip that they’d come with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>And yet, this dearth of info didn’t stop AMD from letting our Ziff cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-benchmark">IGN</a> from testing out the RX 9070 on the show floor. In an Extreme-quality <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> benchmark at native 4K, it averaged 99fps, which IGN reckon puts it roughly on par with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review">GeForce RTX 4080 Super</a>. Not bad going, except the latter is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">replaced by the RTX 5080</a> at the end of this month, seemingly without significant price bump. As with pretty much of all of AMD’s CES reveals – interesting on paper yet light on performance specifics – we’ll have to wait and see how they do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though available already in other regions prior to the film's release in December, in the UK the meals will be available from today until 18th February.</p>
<p>The included toy also differs. In the US the meals include a plastic character figure in a rolling wheel, while in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHenBg5IGyg">UK it's fabric balls with character faces</a>.</p>

			<p>At CES 2025, we learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> PC handheld will be the first officially licensed SteamOS-powered device not manufactured by Valve. There has been much speculation about whether and when SteamOS would officially move beyond the Steam Deck, and it's finally happening.</p>
<p>Valve itself&nbsp;<span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the subject in</span> a blog post, explaining that this will be the exact same version of SteamOS available on their own Steam Deck. A team is working to ensure everything will work just as well when the device ships. Moreover, Valve said that this work to support the Lenovo Legion Go S will also improve compatibility with other handhelds. Before this handheld ships on the market, Valve plans to ship a beta version of SteamOS that will improve the experience on other handhelds for users to download and test for themselves. The work will continue after the device's launch, too, as you would expect from Valve.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems like the Lenovo Legion Go S will have two variants, one without SteamOS and one with Valve's operating system. The former will be available later this month with the regular Windows, priced at $729.99 initially, although a configuration priced at $599.99 is expected to be available in May. That's also when the SteamOS version of the handheld is due to launch at an even cheaper of $499.99.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S Windows Variant</figcaption></figure>
<p>The $729.99 version is the one equipped with the Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, which likely explains the higher price. The other two versions, either Windows or SteamOS, will feature the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor. The price difference is likely due to licensing fees.</p>
<p>Other than that, the specifications should be the same: 8” WUXGA 16:10 120Hz PureSight touch display with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, up to 32GB of 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM, 3-cell 55.5Whr battery, two USB 4 ports, a microSD card reader, and WiFi6e support.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro.1076907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro’s Blank Voucher is a classic roguelike example of asking players to enter the unknown. The item appears to do nothing, offers zilch to a run, and wants to sap you of precious Store currency. So we’re here to dig into what the Blank Voucher is, what it does, and the real purpose behind its existence.</p>



<p>The beauty of a roguelike gameplay loop is each run differs—some more so than others. Balatro joins this <em>club</em>, shows <em>heart</em>, and is ultimately a <em>diamond </em>in the rough. Its endless array of Jokers and gameplay modifiers are why the indie title is our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Indie Game of 2024</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s pick</a>.</p>



<p>Curiosity is a big aspect of your first few hours in Balatro. You add cards you don’t know the purpose of, and choose items that seem innocuous now but could be the difference between a failed run and a victory. The Blank Voucher epitomizes these traits, and I’ve got everything you need to know about the expensive Shop voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-blank-voucher-in-balatro">What is the Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So why should I buy it then? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher is a $10 consumable added to your redeemed Vouchers once you purchase it from Balatro’s midround Shop.</strong></p>



<p>Complete any Small, Big, or Boss Blind in Balatro, and you’re taken to the Shop. You can spend your accumulated money on Jokers, Booster Packs, standalone cards, and Vouchers here. We’re taking a closer look at Vouchers, in particular, the Blank Voucher.</p>



<p>On its own, the Blank Voucher “Does nothing?” and is a little disconcerting as the eye-watering $10 fee could be better spent elsewhere. Balatro has a trick or two up its sleeve though to make the purchase worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does the Blank Voucher do in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher on its own has zero effects and offers nothing to a run</strong>, but if you <strong>buy it 10 times</strong> during different playthroughs, <strong>you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</strong></p>



<p>You need to suffer for 10 runs buying the Blank Voucher knowing it provides no bonuses. It’s a meaningless, stagnant consumable designed to look pretty. Purchase it on 10 unique occasions, and you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-blank-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Buy Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>You should buy the Blank Voucher whenever you get the opportunity—unless you’re struggling on a run—as the Antimatter Voucher is an incredible item.</strong></p>



<p>I can tell you now the <strong>Antimatter Voucher is one of my favorites in the game</strong>. It gives you an <strong>extra, free Joker slot</strong> to use however you wish—with zero consequences. Whereas a Negative Joker gives you an extra slot in exchange for requiring the Negative Joker to remain in your possession, Antimatter is more liberating.</p>



<p>I don’t need to tell you how beneficial this is, but I will anyway. How many runs have you had where an additional Joker could help you beat the Ante 8 Boss Blind? You’ve got a couple of scaling Jokers, a plus-mult Joker, a times-mult Joker, and a Chip-boosting Joker, but the shop is offering another Rare Joker to push your score potential over the edge.</p>



<p>Antimatter gives you a lot more flexibility and firepower to stack Chips on Mults—or add Blind-beating modifiers. <strong>Always buy a Blank Voucher</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Balatro’s addictiveness continues to consume me as the months go by. Are you still enjoying it? Also, what are your favorite Jokers to use?</p>

                <p>It's official: Valve's SteamOS will be available on more platforms soon, and the first handheld PC gaming device to adopt the operating system will be the new Lenovo Legion Go S. At CES 2025, it was revealed that the slim Lenovo unit will run on the Linux-based OS--, the same one used on Valve's Steam Deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121"></a><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg"></figure><p>The big draw here is that SteamOS is more intuitive to use and better suited for smaller screens when compared to its Windows 11 counterparts. While you are losing out on the flexibility of being able to load games from multiple storefronts, SteamOS makes up for it by being quick and easy to use thanks to its design. Essentially, if you're looking for a pick-up-and-play handheld gaming PC that isn't a chore to use and you don't mind sticking to Steam, these new Lenovo devices could be perfect for you.</p><p>As for the new Lenovo model, the Legion Go S looks like it'll be a direct competitor to the Steam Deck thanks to several hardware changes. Most notable is that it won't offer Switch-like removable controllers, but it will keep the small trackpad found underneath the face buttons. These handhelds will be flexing some impressive power thanks to the new AMD Z2 Go chip. These will also be equipped with a 120Hz variable-refresh-rate display and customizable levers on the rear.</p><p>Lenovo will launch a $730 model equipped with a Windows OS, a 1TB SSD, and 32GB of RAM first, and another Windows OS version with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for $600 in May. The SteamOS Legion Go S is also planned to launch in May, and while exact hardware specs haven't been confirmed yet, we do know that it'll be priced at $500. Additionally, Valve will support it with SteamOS updates.</p>

            <p>Classic FM is launching a new video game music radio series presented by Minecraft YouTuber DanTDM.</p>
<p>Next Level with DanTDM launches on Saturday 11th January at 9pm for an hour, and will run each week until Easter.</p>
<p>The first episode will focus on legendary soundtracks from games such as The Legend of Zelda, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, The Elder Scrolls, and of course Minecraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/dantdm-next-level-video-game-music-series/">Classic FM</a> has championed video game music for quite some time, with entries in its Hall of Fame from 2012. It then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fms-video-game-music-show-is-back-for-a-second-series-in-november">launched High Score in 2017</a>, a radio series presented by BAFTA-award-winning composer Jessica Curry, who also co-founded Everybody's Gone to the Rapture studio The Chinese Room.</p>
<p>It seems clear, though, the radio service is aiming for a younger audience with the hiring of Daniel Middleton, aka DanTDM.</p>
<p>The YouTuber has 29 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw">his channel</a>, with more than 20bn views across his online content.</p>
<p>"Teenage me wouldn't be able to believe I have my own radio show!" he said. "Having studied music production at university and then worked in video games for the past 15 years, being given a show that celebrates the meeting of these two worlds feels totally surreal.</p>
<p>"Classic FM is such an iconic station and I'm really grateful and excited to have been given this opportunity."</p> <div>

<p>"Across three months, he will not only showcase the greatest video game music to our loyal listeners, but with Dan at the controls, we're looking forward to welcoming VGM fans to Classic FM for the first time too," added Classic FM managing editor Philip Noyce. "We have always championed new forms of classical music, from film scores to gaming soundtracks, so I'm pleased to announce this next chapter in our support of video game music."</p><p>DanTDM has recently been involved with charity work, <a href="https://x.com/dantdm/status/1859288096098898244">donating gaming carts to Great Ormond Street Hospital</a> for Children. Additionally, he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV-DiKWne8s">admitted he was invited to see the set of the Minecraft film</a>, with some fans speculating he has some form of cameo.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Minecraft film's second trailer</a> released in November, with the full film launching on 4th April this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">reported</a> that the US federal government had placed Chinese video game publisher Tencent - owner of League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear and much more besides - on a list of Chinese military companies. The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.</p>
<p>At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.</p><!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">statement in full</a> is rather robotic, and mostly just fleshes out the spokesperson's previous argument that Tencent is not, in fact, involved with anything military. It further argues that Tencent is not a "military-civil fusion", in response to the US defence department's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4023145/dod-releases-list-of-chinese-military-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1260/">standing claim</a> that China's armed forces rely on "technology and expertise" provided by Chinese "companies, universities and research programs" that "appear to be civilian entities".</p>
<p>"As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the [Chinese Military Company] List is a mistake," the statement reads. "Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group."</p><p>The statement also specifies that the "CMC list" - which was introduced under the first Trump presidency, and is known inside the US government as the Section 1260H list - is distinct from another document, the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List, maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. The point being that "inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company".</p>
<p>Tencent are about "to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake", during which they "will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List."</p>
<p>If it comes to a lawsuit, Tencent won't be the first Chinese company to go to court over their inclusion on the US federal government's list of "military-civil fusions". As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/">Reuters</a>, drone maker DJI and Lidar maker Hesai Technologies sued the Pentagon last year over their designations, though they're still on the list for the moment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony's upcoming Until Dawn film adaptation will feature both a new cast of characters and a new story.</p>
<p>This titbit was shared during a presentation at CES by Sony's president of film division Screen Gems Ashley Brucks, who stated that while the film would - clearly - be different in some ways to the original Until Dawn game, it would still respect the series' source material.</p>
<p>"The key to [successfully] adapting these games comes down to one thing: respecting the source material," Brucks said (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">IGN</a>). "Our close collaboration with PlayStation Productions gives us and our filmmakers the advantage of working directly with the creators of the game."</p>
<p>The Sony exec said it was a "careful balance of trying to identify and incorporate what the fans love about the game and the experience as well as offering something fresh and exciting to entice newcomers".</p>
<p>"In adapting Until Dawn, filmmaker David F. Sandberg, who is a big fan of the widely acclaimed game, took the essence of what makes the game great and selected elements we think are the most important to the fans and paid homage to it in the right way," Brucks continued. "We then built out Until Dawn's universe, using the core premise of a group of friends who encounter a variety of terrifying threats to tell a new story that is truly visceral and horrifying."</p>

<p>Actor Peter Stromare, who is said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-sees-peter-stormare-reprise-his-role-as-dr-hill">reprising his role as psychiatrist Dr Hill in Until Dawn's adaptation (so, perhaps there is at least one returning character after all)</a>, added the film will "honour the spirit of the game".</p><p>"I have been lucky to be part of Until Dawn since the original, incredible, super terrifying game, and what's why I'm so excited to be part of this film, because the whole thing is a love letter to horror, and it completely honours the spirit of the game," Stormare said.</p>
<p>"The movie is going to be full of fresh characters and victims in a brand new story loaded with twists, so whether you're a longtime fan or discovering it for the first time, get ready for Until Dawn like you've never seen it before."</p>
<p>The Until Dawn film is set to arrive later this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-horror-until-dawns-live-action-movie-adaptation-arrives-next-april">on 25th April</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, the recently released PS5 remake introduced a new ending for Until Dawn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">which hints towards a sequel</a> (please be aware of story spoilers for Until Dawn if you follow the link).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games available on the Xbox Game Pass can expect to lose around 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, although being available as part of the subscription can be beneficial for some of them.</p>
<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session hosted on the <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/news-publisher/industry-q-a-christopher-dring-answers-your-questions.37/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Install Base forums</a>, former head of GamesIndustry.biz Chris Dring revealed some interesting tidbits on sales of games available on Xbox Game Pass, saying that any game can expect to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, less if it is a big mainstream release. How low Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and even Starfield have charted makes it clear how Game Pass hurt the sales of these games on Xbox consoles. Being available on Xbox Game Pass, however, can also be beneficial for multiplatform games, as a surge of players on Xbox can have a strong impact on sales on PlayStation.</p>
<p>While a game being available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library can lead to lost sales, it can also make it easier for developers to get people to try out their game. Chris Dring highlighted that, from data, it is known that a lot of people only play the Call of Duty series, and if some of them got the game via the Xbox Game Pass this year, they might have tried another game available on the subscription service they may otherwise never have played. Unfortunately, this may be a best-case scenario, as the limited growth of subscription services and the existence of big free games that are hundreds of hours long makes it unlikely.</p>
<p>While Microsoft never made it clear, it's evident from the company's marketing messaging and some of its latest decisions, such as the first major changes introduced to the service <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">last year </a>since its launch, that the Xbox Game Pass is impacting their console business. According to well-known analyst Mat Piscatella, the company's approach to its subscription service needs to be balanced with its other services, and the aforementioned changes introduced last year suggest that this is what Microsoft is attempting to do. Balancing the service and further expanding on other systems, according to the analyst, could make Xbox's future <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">bright.</a></p>

            <p>God-wrecking MOBA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> is going free-to-play next week after four months of paid early access. The game of omniscient deities scrapping over lanes and minions has been playable since September last year by early bird "founders" willing to pay some bucks (it had plenty of closed alphas since May too) but now it's finally opening up to the rest of us mere mortals. And it's throwing in a new "god" too, the genie-toting thief Aladdin. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It'll be free-to-play from Jan 14th, say developers Hi-Rez in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2437170/view/525331314946081986">a Steam post</a>. There'll be 45 playable gods, including the fresh addition of the thief from One Thousand And One Nights. Aladdin can trap enemy players in his lamp where they'll have to fight both the pilferer and his genie (you can read <a href="https://www.smite2.com/news/aladdin-closer-look/">more about his skills here</a> if you like). Other characters to be added in the free-to-play update include Mulan, Geb, Ullr, and Agni - all gods returning from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a>.</p>
<p>The usual many-laned Conquest mode will be there to induce many a teamfuss. But it'll also be adding a few extra game modes. Joust is a 3v3 single lane mode, for example, while Duel mode is a one-on-one scenario. Assault mode is also returning from the previous game, and is "similar to the regular conquest mode, but instead features a single lane and no jungle."</p>
<p>Lacking in Smite wisdom, we placed freelance offerings at the shrine of Matt Cox (RPS in peace) and he blessed us with his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2-early-access-review">early access Smite 2 review</a>. He thought it was okay, but noted that the supreme beings of Hi-Rez' pantheon have to compete with the agile and exciting heroes of Valve's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>. And the comparison does not make Thor et al look as godly as they might like to think. </p>
<blockquote>I haven’t spent a single second wishing I wasn’t playing Deadlock instead. Valve’s third-person MOBA shooter has emerged with wildly unfortunate timing for Hi-Rez, rendering me incapable of not dwelling on how it innovates where Smite stagnates. Smite sells itself as the MOBA where every shot’s a skillshot, but Deadlock is the MOBA where every shot is an actual shot, comboed with a sprinting dodge-jump into a powerslide.</blockquote>
<p>It's god eat god out there in the MOBA realms, my friends. Meanwhile, Hi-Rez are not shutting down Smite 1, they say, but their attention has shifted heavily to the sequel. In October, the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-rez-studios-lay-off-unknown-number-of-workers-to-give-smite-2-a-sustainable-future">laid off a number of workers</a>, leaving only small teams to work on "light updates" for both Smite 1 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a damning report of mental and physical abuse at Indonesian support studio Brandoville.</p>
<p>The studio provided assistance to Ubisoft on the forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, though it closed in August last year, after which reports of abuse emerged.</p>

<p>Yesterday a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horrific-abuse-of-workers-at-indonesian-external-development-studio-revealed-in-new-report">report from People Make Games detailed allegations of abuse by Brandoville commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai</a>, who ran day-to-day operations of the studio.</p>
<p>Before its closure, the studio provided art and animation support for games like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Age of Empires 4.</p>
<p>However, reports allege from 2019 to the studio's closure in 2024, Lai abused multiple employees. This ranged from imposing a strict work schedule and daily Christian worship, to forcing an employee to write lines like a schoolchild, humiliating her in front of colleagues, and demanding a video of her slapping herself a hundred times as punishment.</p>
<p>Other abuse includes controlling the finances of employees and overworking a pregnant employee, whose prematurely born son sadly died after four months in intensive care.</p>
<p>You can watch the full report in the video above, though be aware it contains harrowing content and footage.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has also contacted Age of Empires publisher Microsoft, though a response is yet to be issued.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch next month, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delay in November</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While Nintendo seems content to wait some more before announcing the Nintendo Switch 2, accessories manufacturers aren't pleased about the system still being kept under wraps, and some have started revealing more about the highly anticipated console.</p>
<p>Accessories manufacturer Genki is showcasing its Nintendo Switch 2 accessories lineup at CES 2025, and reputable French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerama</a> had the chance to check out a mock-up of the system reportedly based on a real system the manufacturer owns and how the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers work. The new mock-up also confirms a bigger size over the original console and a second USB-C port on the top of the console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="fr">VIDEO — La Nintendo Switch 2 en avant-première au <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a>.</p>
<p>L'accessoiriste Genki indique posséder la vraie console et expose une maquette 3D + des accessoires.</p>
<p>Les détails ici : <a href="https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1">https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1</a> <a href="https://t.co/IJ6taQggIQ">pic.twitter.com/IJ6taQggIQ</a></p>
<p>— Numerama (@Numerama) <a href="https://twitter.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Following the report from Numerama, Genki decided to go all-in with the early Nintendo Switch 2 reveal by adding a short video on its <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> showcasing the full unit and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-dock-60w-charger/">dock</a>. While there's no way to verify if everything is indeed based on the real system or on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">other mock-ups</a>, there's a solid chance the video is showing the real console, given how pretty much everything about it is leaking online.</p>
<p>Genki isn't the only Nintendo Switch 2 accessories manufacturer showing its upcoming products during CES 2025, and Numerama spoke with some of them, who all seem to agree that the system will launch in April. According to some of these manufacturers, it is possible to even purchase the console already on the black market, which, as Numerama highlights, sounds like a bold claim considering nothing has leaked regarding software.</p>
<p>With new leaks and rumors sprouting like mushrooms almost daily, the only thing that is left is for Nintendo to finally announce the Nintendo Switch 2. When the reveal will happen not even these chatty manufacturers know, but with all these daily leaks, it shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In a fairly exciting case of two major industry stories meeting in the middle, former members of downfallen indie publisher Annapurna Interactive have reportedly joined forces to take control of several game projects previously published by Take-Two Interactive's label Private Division, which has itself been sold off amid layoffs. The game projects in question include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series and an unannounced project from Pokémon developer Game Freak.</p>
<p>That's from a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">Bloomberg</a> article (paywall), helpfully summarised by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-annapurna-interactive-staff-acquire-take-two-s-private-division-label">Game Developer</a>. To give you the backstory here, Annapurna Interactive are a division of fancy-dan auteur-driven media company Annapurna Pictures, known for films like Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle. Founded in 2016, the Interactive label are the publishers of such acclaimed smaller game projects as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>. Notwithstanding the critical success of these projects, there have long been tensions between Annapurna Pictures leadership and the gaming division. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">entire staff of Annapurna Interactive resigned in September 2024</a>, after the failure of negotiations to spin the label off as a separate company.</p>
<p>Then, in November, Take-Two announced that they would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-two-are-selling-private-division-and-closing-roll7-and-intercept-because-theyre-in-the-business-of-making-great-big-hits">sell Private Division</a>, while also confirming the closure of OlliOlli World devs Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 devs Intercept Games. Private Division are comparable to Annapurna Interactive in publishing "mid-tier" games like Rollerdrome and After Us, that have a particular combination of artsy-experimental and blockbuster polish - the broad idea being to enhance Take-Two's prestige as a publisher of innovative work and establish revenue streams beyond the vast empires of Rockstar and 2K Games. Or at least, that's my impression, based on years of preview events.</p>
<p>It's the kind of venture that gets chopped when the old "economic headwinds" are a-blowing and investors aren't seeing desired returns, even when the operation is making money. "The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick observed back in November. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits."</p><p>Which brings us to today. According to Bloomberg, a new, currently unnamed team of former Annapurna Interactive staff have struck a deal with private equity firm Haveli, the new owners of Private Division, to take control of several Private Division projects and franchises.</p>
<p>The deal doesn't cover everything Private Division were working on at the time of their sale. For example, it doesn't include two new projects from Yellow Brick Games and Bloober Team, which Private Division were to publish: Yellow Brick will self-publish their game, while Bloober's deal with Private Division has been fully dissolved. As for what remains of Annapurna Interactive, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactive-has-splintered-into-two-groups-both-of-which-are-now-working-to-pick-up-the-pieces-says-new-report">Annapurna executives are now hiring staff</a> so they can follow through on existing obligations.</p>
<p>I have a lot of love for Annapurna Interactive's line-up, particularly The Outer Wilds, and am happy to see a few of the people involved with those projects striking up afresh under a different banner. I hope the former Private Division members who've lost their jobs as part of the sale have similar success elsewhere. I am also curious to hear about the new Game Freak game, though given Game Freak's heavy association with Nintendo, I wouldn't be surprised if it was exclusively for consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There’s a good bit for Xbox fans in this set of five Most Wanted 2025 games, with a pair of exclusives that are coming from Compulsion Games and Playground Games respectively. Sure, we might have doubts about whether they’ll stay as exclusives for very long, these days, but they should be a good reason to pick up an asymmetrical gamepad… or boot up your gaming PC.</p>
<h2>20 – Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Morphing out of the DLC plans for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2/">Dying Light 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has grown into a standalone game, bringing back the fan favourite protagonist from the original game, Kyle Crane. It’s been thirteen years since we last saw him, and he’s now exploring the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, a region filled with both human factions and monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azIBRaiB05I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kyle himself is no longer truly human, the zombie DNA fully merging with his own to provide some major new powers – he is the titular Beast, if you hadn’t guessed.</p>

<p>We got to go hands on back at Gamescom 2024, and you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">check out our preview impressions here</a>.</p>
<h2>19 – Two Point Museum</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 4th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Having revolutionised healthcare and teaching across Two Point County, where to next for this tongue-in-cheek management sim series? Well, why not dust some old bones and tomes in the museums of this world? Also… ghosts?</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum Preview – We played the&nbsp;Prehistory, Marine Life &amp; Supernatural museums" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLbM27hYcsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two Point Museum is bringing plenty of new ideas to the table, as you build out museums around each theme, soak in all of the pun-laden artefacts and beings that you can exhibit, and curate entertaining tours to inform and enlighten your visitors… and convince them to toss a coin into your donation pitcher.</p>
<p>We’ve played the opening few levels and had a grand time digging into the new setting. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/03/two-point-museum-preview-dino-bones-funny-fishies-spooky-spectres/">Read our Two Point Museum preview here</a>.</p>
<h2>18 – South of Midnight</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from Compulsion Games, the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/09/we-happy-few-review/">We Happy Few</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> looks to be something rather different, whisking us away to the fantasy world of Prospero and confronting our heroine Hazel with giant sea monsters.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLBOyKqw58A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game features an almost claymation visual style, blending together action adventure exploration with Bayonetta-style combat. The world blends together vibes of the deep south of America with giant, island-sized alligators and more, which you’ll come across after a hurricane has ripped across this world.</p>
<h2>17 – Civilization VII</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, NSW, PC – 11th February 2025</em></p>
<p>There’s been a good few pretenders to the throne emerging over the last few years, but Civilization VII is arriving in just over a month to firmly put its stamp on the historical 4X genre once more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game will tackle the concept of shifting ages, just as the genre as a whole has been. Split into three distinct ages – Antiquity, Exploration and Modern – each civ is restricted to a particular time period and then has to grow and morph into another through a point of crisis. Rome will eventually fall, but that can provide the historical and gameplay foundations to become any number of medieval empires – the Holy Roman Empire, perhaps? – and from there lead into modern European nations.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/">hands on with Civ VII back at Gamescom 2024</a>, as well as having the opportunity to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/interview-ed-beach-on-civilization-vii-ages-diplomacy-security-blankets/">speak with Creative Director Ed Beach</a> about this major new direction for the series.</p>
<h2>16 – Fable</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>We’re putting a lot of trust in Playground Games and Xbox with this one. It’s been years since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-announce-reveal/">the formal announcement of Fable in 2020</a>, which had already been long-rumoured to be in the works, and every occasional reappearance at Xbox showcases has been heavily reliant on lusciously produced cinematics and an understated British sense of humour, rather than gameplay. Still, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> is supposedly on track for release in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fable - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FiBmVBaY0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To be charitable, the most recent trailer from last June does state that it’s “in-game footage” and shift between clips that could be representative of in-game dialogue scenes and wandering through the environments, building up to some quick shots of combat. It does look very, very pretty, as the baton is passed from the now retired hero Humphry to a new hero.</p>
<p>One we want to see much, much more of, and which we’d expect is coming later, rather than sooner. There’s other big first party Xbox games expected before then!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>That’s not the half of it for Xbox and PC gamers this year, with more exclusives still to come as we approach the top 10.</em></p>

            <p>
Accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> have been shown off at the CES 2025 trade show in Las Vegas by accessories manufacturer Genki.
</p>
<p>
French website <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html">Numerama</a> went hands-on with one of these models and was told by Genki representatives that it was based on access to the actual Switch 2, which it expected to launch in April this year.
</p>
<p>
Incredibly, the report states that access to an actual Switch 2 unit via the black market is also now possible, "if you put up the money". 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is still to announce Switch 2, but at this point it feels like there's little left to learn about how the next-generation handheld will look.
</p>
<p>
Still, these latest images - and video, below - of the Switch 2 dummy unit that Genki is showing off give us our best view yet of the hardware.

<p>
As we've seen in images of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">multiple previous</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">Switch 2 accessories</a>, and as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">reported separately</a> prior to that, Switch 2 will be a slightly larger version of Nintendo's current hardware, with an additional "C" button on the right Joy-Con, magnetic attachments for the controllers, and an additional USB-C port on the device's top. 
</p>
<p>
Videos shown on Genki's stand, and also now on the company's website, show a highly-detailed look at the new Switch 2 Joy-Con - including its previously-rumoured optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for more.
</p>
<p>
Separately, yet another accessories manufacturer has begun advertising its own add-ons via Amazon in Japan. Images of a Switch 2 console cover from third-party company Laziro offer yet another look at what the handheld is expected to look like:

"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense,"  industry analyst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">Serkan Toto told Eurogamer last month</a>. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them."
</p>
<p>Nintendo has itself revealed little about Switch 2. Officially, we only know for certain that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">the console will be announced before 31st March</a>, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has kicked off the new year by announcing a second open beta test.</p>
<p>This beta will include the content from the first beta - so Character Creation, Story Trial and the Slay Doshaguma Quest - as well as the chance to hunt down Gypceros, a returning monster for the series. If you took part in the first beta, you can transfer your character to the second beta. This data, Capcom said, can also be transferred to the full game on release, however it stressed the same isn't the case for any game progress made.</p>
<p>Those interested in giving the second open beta a go will be able to do so between 6th February, with things getting going from 7pm Pacific time - that's actually 3am on 7th February, for those of us in the UK. This wave of the beta will run until 9th February, culminating at 6.59pm Pacific (so, 2.59am on 10th February in the UK). Another beta weekend will take place the following weekend running between 13th February and 16th February. Timings remain the same.</p>
<p>The beta is available for those Monster Hunter Wilds' players on PC via Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Those who take part will get some added bonuses in the full game, such as a decorative weapon charm.</p>
<p>"Please note that adjustments including performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, quality of life improvements and more will not be present or reflected in the second Open Beta Test build," Capcom added in a video announcing the beta, which you can see below.</p>

<p>The first Monster Hunter Wilds beta test took place towards the end of last year, and you may recall that while it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">pulled in an impressive number of players</a>, it was a little rough around the edges. Many of those partaking shared screenshots of angular, almost Nintendo 64-looking graphics during the beta's run, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">creatures looking more akin to animated origami rather than the fully fledged monsters</a> they were meant to be.</p><p>However, Capcom has said it has listened to all of the feedback and requests that have come its way since that first beta, and are "working hard to improve the quality of the game for launch" (which is set for 28th February).</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the Eurogamer team's most anticipated games of the year. Want to know our full list?

            <p>Physical game sales in the UK dropped by a massive 34.5 percent over the past year.</p>
<p>Digital game sales also dropped, though only by one percent, while subscription services grew by 12 percent. It's indicative of a shift across the entire entertainment industry towards digital services.</p>

<p>The news comes courtesy of the <a href="https://www.eraltd.org/streaming-and-vinyl-drive-music-to-twenty-year-high">Digital Entertainment and Retail Association</a> (ERA), based on data from Nielsen/GfK, India, and GSD.</p>
<p>Year-on-year, PC downloads dropped by five percent, digital console sales were down 15 percent, and physical games sales plummeted by 35 percent. Mobile and tablet gaming grew by 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason for this is the comparison with 2023, which saw huge physical sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>2024's biggest selling game in the UK was, unsurprisingly, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>. It generated 2.9m sales, 80 percent of which were digital.</p>
<p>"After the breakneck growth of recent years, it is no surprise that the games market has slowed down, but it remains a giant," said ERA's CEO Kim Bayley. "Despite the attractions of digital business models to developers, we believe physical still has a role to play."</p>
<p>Despite year-on-year decline between 2023-2024, 2025 is predicted to bring growth to the industry, due to the expected release of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console and Rockstar's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/the-lenovo-legion-go-s-will-be-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve and Lenovo have announced that they’re bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steamos">SteamOS</a> to the Lenovo Legion Go S, making it the first officially licensed third party handheld that can be powered by Valve’s gaming-oriented branch of Linux.</p>
<p>This is part of a big new push for the handheld PC gaming market by Lenovo. The Legion Go S is a slightly smaller 8″ rendition of the upcoming Legion Go 2, which has an 8.8″ display. The Go S’s 8″ screen is still impressive, with a 1920×1200 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, this is allied with either the AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, 16GB or 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of SSD storage. All models come with Wi-Fi 6e support, a pair of USB 4 ports and a microSD card slot as well.</p>


<p>This isn’t exclusively SteamOS, though. Lenovo is hedging their bets with a Windows 11 version as well, and this will actually ship first. The Windows edition Legion Go S will debut this month starting at $730 for a config with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p>
<p>Other SKUs will ship in May. The Windows edition will then have an entry level model at $600 with 16GB RAM and 1TB storage, or you can go with SteamOS starting at $500 for 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD.</p>
<p>This follows through on Valve’s plan to open up SteamOS to third parties once again. The gaming OS originally debuted with Steam Machines back in the day, but its return with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> has been exclusive to Valve’s own handheld up until this point. Last year they talked about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">porting it to the Asus ROG Ally</a>, for example.</p>

<p>The tricky thing for Valve is that, where SteamOS was able to target Steam Deck as a fixed platform, where they were able to leverage specific hardware features for the screen, implement quick suspend / resume and other tweaks, it’s trickier to be a more general OS.</p>
<p>A lot of PC handhelds have common ground to the Steam Deck by using AMD integrated chipsets as their foundation, but everything else will require dedicated support. That can be the display driver to enable VRR and other refresh rate controls, supporting back buttons, different Wi-Fi chipsets, and much more. Still, Valve is committing to providing the same experience to their new and upcoming partners, and many gamers are hoping that they’ll offer SteamOS as a basic download that anyone can use with their game PC – handheld, laptop, or desktop.</p>

		<p>It’s a good time to be a Monster Hunter fan, what with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> coming on 28th February… but what if you want to play sooner? Well, Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has good news for you, announcing that Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta 2 is also coming in February!</p>
<p><iframe title="New Year's Greetings 2025 | Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso?start=12&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta 2 will take place across two weekends, across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, with crossplay enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekend 1</strong> – Thursday 6th February 7PM PT through Sunday 9th February 6:59PM PT</li>
<li><strong>Weekend 2</strong> – Thursday 13th February 7PM PT through Sunday 16th February 6:59PM PT</li>
</ul>
<p>That translates to a 3AM start time on Friday mornings in the UK.</p>
<p>Open Beta Test 2 will expand on the first beta test with some additional monsters for you to take on. In addition to the full character creation suite, the story trial and the slay Doshaguma quest, you’ll also be able to hunt Gypceros.</p>

<p>You can carry forward your characters created for the first beta test, and that can also be transferred to the full game, though game progress is not transferring. If you do take part in the beta, you’ll also get a cute little charm for your weapon or Seikret.</p>
<p>The development team does warn that outside of content this will not be a significant shift when compared to the first beta. This includes adjustments to performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, quality of life improvements and more that will only be made for the full game. Capcom detailed the changes being made in a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/monster-hunter-wilds-pre-launch-update-addresses-open-beta-issues/">community update</a> back in December.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game last year, sharing impressions in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>. Nic said, “Time will tell how Wilds eventually plays out, but I must say — I am more excited than ever to get my hands on the final game. Just like at the Meowscular Chef’s kitchen, this small taste of a gorgeous offering from Capcom has me desperately wanting more.”</p>

			<p>This morning, CAPCOM <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWAYmEQKso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds will soon get a second Open Beta test (the first one <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took place</a> in late October) ahead of the full release in late February.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto shared the news in a brief new video, where he also introduced the differences fans will find in this new test compared to the previous one. The main addition is that&nbsp;players will be able to hunt the returning monster Gypceros.</p>
<p>Other than that, the beta will still feature Character Creation, Story Trial, and the quest to slay Doshaguma. Character creation data will carry over from the previous beta, so if you've played before, you will find your character waiting. Even more interestingly, all this character creation data from the beta tests can be transferred into the full game once purchased. However, no game progress will transfer.</p>
<p>Folks who participated in either of the Open Beta tests will receive special items to be redeemed in the full game: a decorative charm for your weapons or Seikret and an item pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Year's Greetings 2025 | Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tsujimoto also revealed that CAPCOM is working hard at improving Monster Hunter Wilds in various ways based on feedback from the earlier Open Beta test. However, these tweaks and fixes won't be ready for the second test, which will take place on all platforms between February 6 and 9 (starting and ending at 7 PM Pacific Time) and again between February 13 and 16.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to Monster Hunter World (which turned out to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-has-shipped-over-20-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-selling game CAPCOM has ever made</a>, having sold nearly 21 million units on its own and 27 when factoring in the Iceborne expansion), the hype surrounding Monster Hunter Wilds is just as massive as the biggest monsters featured in the game.</p>
<p>In our testing, the anticipation is likely to be fulfilled by the final product, which is out on February 28. In his Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't revolutionize the series' formula in any way, it competently continues to smooth out some of the formula's rough edges to present a more engaging experience. This little taste of the experience left me hungering for more, and I really cannot wait to see what surprises the game has in store for hunters when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S next year.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-combine-xbox-and-windows-gaming-handhelds/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-will-combine-%E2%80%98xbox-and-windows-together%E2%80%99-to-enhance-the-handheld-experience.1076775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-combine-xbox-and-windows-gaming-handhelds/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview, Microsoft’s Jason Ronald, the VP of ‘Next Generation’, explained that the company is working to fuse Xbox and Windows to create an enhanced, accessible, and much more enjoyable handheld gaming experience.</p>



<p>He stressed that the tech titan has ‘spent 20 years building a world-class operation system’, but that OS is confined almost entirely to ‘the console’. The goal is to make Windows-powered gaming handhelds much more efficient and user-friendly by linking the power and versatility of Windows with the gaming-focused capabilities and UI of Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-innovating-for-a-long-time">‘Innovating for a Long Time’</h2>



<p>For years, rumours regarding an Xbox handheld have circulated like wildfire. With the global rise of handheld gaming devices soaring, many have wholeheartedly expected Team Green to come out with <strong>something </strong>in that space, but Xbox’s representatives have remained relatively tight-lipped.</p>



<p>During a recent panel that was covered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by The Verge</a>, Jason Ronald of Microsoft spoke about the impending fusion between Xbox and Windows that will vastly improve how users enjoy their handheld devices. For the longest time, devices like the ASUS ROG Ally (and Ally X) have been hampered by the cumbersome and at times buggy Windows UI and experience on the small screen.</p>



<p>Ronald explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</p>



<p>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many opt to go with a Steam Deck because the SteamOS is built for gaming <strong>first</strong>, whereas the Windows 11 implementation featured on most handheld gaming devices is designed for multi-tasking of sorts.</p>



<p>Sure, it means that all Windows 11 devices are much more versatile and inclusive, but the experience isn’t great overall, and using a stock-standard Windows UI on a 7-inch or 8-inch display is often painstaking.</p>



<p>Ronald summed it up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device.</p>



<p>The reality is the Xbox operating system is built on top of Windows. So there’s a lot of infrastructure that we built in the console space that we can bring to the PC space and really deliver that premium gaming experience on any device.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps this mission could make gaming handhelds feel much more like <strong>gaming handhelds </strong>in future, and not like a miniature laptop that also plays games. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-ally-system-nvidia-ai/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-set-to-feature-nvidia-ai-%E2%80%98ally%E2%80%99-companions.1076772/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-ally-system-nvidia-ai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At CES 2025, NVIDIA unveiled an AI innovation in PUBG – the ‘PUBG Ally’. This AI companion system will grant players a buddy to run around the map with, performing tasks and helping them out on a strategic level, being driven entirely by NVIDIA’s AI technology.</p>



<p>It was claimed that PUBG Ally characters will be capable of human-like behaviour, including sharp decision-making and advanced levels of audio and visual perception. The technology is set to appear in Naraka: Bladepoint and inZOI, but the most-talked-about introduction is in PUBG, the popular battle royale game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first-time">Not The First Time</h2>



<p>In August 2024, I sat down with Arena Breakout: Infinite’s development team to learn about FACUL, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/">revolutionary AI companion system</a> that would align players with AI support in place of real-world gamers. The system was yet to be finessed into the game, but the potential of the system seemed white-hot when it was presented at Gamescom.</p>



<p>It was a throwback of sorts to the decades-old command system found in games like SOCOM.</p>



<p>The PUBG Ally model promises to work the same way as MoreFun Studio’s FACUL engine. In PUBG, a proposed ‘co-playable character’ will support players by finding loot, driving vehicles, and providing cover fire. It’ll use ‘small language models’ to accomplish most of this, empowering the ‘CPC’ to act as a human would in every scenario imaginable.</p>



<p>If you avoid playing PUBG because you’re afraid of running solo in a battle royale game, look no further than the PUBG Ally model.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t confirmed <strong>when </strong>the system would be added to PUBG. It was stressed during the CES 2025 presentation that viewers were watching a tech demo and not a live representation of the model.</p>

<p>Hi-Rez Studios has officially confirmed that Smite 2 will transition from a paid alpha to a free-to-play open beta next week, on Tuesday, January 14. It was back in September 2024 that paying customers gained access to the Smite 2 alpha, but starting next Tuesday, you’ll be able to download and play Smite 2 without spending a penny.</p>



<p>The free-to-play transition will come hand-in-hand with a sizeable content update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-smite-2-free-to-play-update-incoming">Smite 2 Free-to-Play Update Incoming</h2>



<p>The first Smite title debuted in 2014, and it wasn’t until last year that Smite 2 surfaced in an alpha state. Now, the second title is preparing to be offered to a wider audience, with developer Hi-Rez Studios pushing it out with a free-to-play operating model.</p>



<p>When January 14 rolls around, Smite 2 will become free-to-play, but it’ll also receive a substantial update including new God characters, mechanics, and modes.</p>



<p>Smite 2 is already pretty diverse, featuring a stacked roster of playable characters – 45 in total. That number is set to be increased by more than 10% with this update, as five new Gods will come through into the game, four of which are throwbacks to the original game – Ullr, Mulan, Geb, and Agni.</p>



<p>The fifth God will be Aladdin, a character who is paired with a genie that can trap opponents at will. That sounds familiar!</p>



<p>Additionally, Hi-Rez Studios will be introducing a new 3-v-3 mode called Joust. This mode accommodates the arrival of an all-new map, made up of just one lane, such is the mode. The team has also pieced together a 1-v-1 mode called Duel, which will allow players to battle on a much more intimate playing field.</p>



<p>All this is being added to Smite 2 ‘s free-to-play update alongside a slew of quality-of-life changes, such as ‘Role Guides’, and balances.</p>



<p>Will you be downloading Smite 2 when it goes free-to-play? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The first of these gaming chair announcements is the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fconcepts%2Frazer-project-arielle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frazers-new-bladeless-gaming-chair-fan-will-keep-you-cool-or-warm-while-you-play%2F1100-6528681%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Arielle Fan System</a>, a bladeless fan add-on for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Fujin-Ergonomic-Gaming-Chair/dp/B0CMGDGRD8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's Fujin</a> and Fujin Pro mesh gaming chairs.</p><p dir="ltr">The Project Arielle fan attaches to the Fujin and Fujin Pro backrests and, according to Razer's press release, can reduce the perceived temperature by between 2 to 5 degrees Celsius (roughly 3.5 to 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit) with fan noise "as soft as a whisper." It also features energy-efficient heaters that can deliver warm air up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), making it helpful in any environment. Temperature and fan speeds are controlled via a touch panel on the side of the seat, and it can be easily attached or removed from the chair thanks to a quick-release connection.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423819-arielle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423819" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423819-arielle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423819"></a><figcaption>Razer's Project Arielle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423819-arielle.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Pricing and release date information has not been revealed, though Razer is demoing Project Arielle in person at its CES 2025 booth, so we expect the fan add-on to launch in the near future.
