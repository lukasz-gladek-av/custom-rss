			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-launches-blade-18-intel-core-i9-14900hx-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-thunderbolt-5/">Razer</a> unveiled its latest controller, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, which is slated as the "ultimate wireless Esports controller. " Made using cutting-edge technology, this controller is officially licensed by Xbox, with extensive play testing and feedback from Eric "Snip3down" Wrona, a 2-time X Games medalist and 24-time Halo champion. With Wrona's approval and feedback, the controller is set to aid those who play games competitively with advanced customization, fast, responsive inputs, and ergonomics.</p>
<p>The controller features four mouse click-back paddles, two claw grip bumpers, Razer Pro HyperTriggers, Hall Effect precision thumbsticks, and Razer HyperSpeed Wireless connectivity to give gamers a seamless, comfortable experience.</p>
<p>Team Razer is already expansive, but it now includes Eric Wrona, the first controller-using esports competitor to join the team. His feedback is vital to the creation of the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro. "The Wolverine V3 Pro's intuitive design and customizable features provide a significant competitive edge. It's the undeniable choice for anyone serious about winning," says Eric Wrona.</p>
<p>The controller utilizes Hall Effect Thumbsticks, which are similar to traditional thumbsticks but come with advanced technology such as Anti-friction rings and top-tier materials to ensure that they don't wear down quickly and have long-lasting durability.</p>
<p>In addition, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro also comes with the Razer Controller app, which allows users to customize their experience further. By using this app, players can find the precision filters that work for them and customize their Dead Zones to fit the needs of the game they're playing.</p>
<p>The Wireless Razer Wolverine V3 Pro uses a USB Type-A Dongle which you can fit into a USB slot on your device, allowing you to play with a seamless connection using a 2.4 Ghz connection on either your Xbox or PC. If you're worried about your controller getting dirty, the accessory comes with its very own carrying case which holds the controller, two replacement thumbstick caps, the wireless dongle and a 10ft cable, making the controller as portable as needs be so you can take it to tournaments and competitions without worrying about it getting scuffed or dirty in your bag.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If the wireless version isn't for you, Razer has also announced the wired version of the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition, which has all of the same features as this controller but allows you to have a consistent wired connection.</p>
<p>If you're interested in this professional eSports controller, you can purchase it on the <a href="https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razer store</a> for $199.99. Alternatively, if you'd like the wired version, the price is $99.99.</p>

<p>Treyarch has revealed additional details about the Black Ops 6 Zombies through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brzOBsdEAf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CODNext</a> Showcase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-black-ops-6-zombies-maps-available-at-launch">2 Black Ops 6 Zombies Maps Available at Launch</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies will launch with two maps, Liberty Falls and Terminus Island, featuring the return of round-based gameplay. In the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls, players will find a ‚Äúbuilt-out world‚Äù that highlights stories of people who once lived there. Moreover, there will be some side quests as well across both maps.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Zombies devs embraced the 90s and the nostalgia in Liberty Falls, bringing elements such as a comic shop, a video store, a bowling alley, and more to this world. Additionally, the vibes of Liberty Falls and Terminus are very different, with the former feeling deceptively safe at first and the latter being dark and gloomy throughout.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The developers unveiled some new toys players can play with in Black Ops 6 Zombies. First is&nbsp;the Thrustodyne M23, which will help you quickly mow down the undead. Another addition is the Zombies Wunderwaffe DG-2, ready to shock anyone that comes your way. Players can also supercharge their Dedicated Melee option with the new Melee Macchiato, available at Perk Machines around the map.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will also find unique traps on each map, so you should ‚ÄúTrigger the Aetherella Trap in the Liberty Falls Comic Shop or Dark Aether Field Trap to leave a special surprise for our decaying friends‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-additional-update-and-quality-of-life-improvements-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Additional Update and Quality of Life Improvements in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, improvements such as save and quit in solo matches, joining a friend‚Äôs match progress at any time, and pausing solo matches will be available for Black Ops 6 Zombies. Also, the developers revealed that Door costs can now be shared between players, armour can be purchased through Wall Buys in Terminus Island and Liberty Falls, player-specific drops will be introduced, and self-revive will be limited to 3.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-is-a-perfectly-fine-open-world-game-set-in-an-incredible-universe.966378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> isn‚Äôt a game you play because you want to experience the most innovative open world. It‚Äôs not full of ideas that will shake up the genre, and its structure and gameplay can get pretty repetitive. In a lot of ways, it‚Äôs standard stuff. But for a certain kind of player, none of that will matter. Because what makes <em>Outlaws</em> notable is the <em>Star Wars</em> part ‚Äî it‚Äôs an average open-world game but an incredible <em>Star Wars</em> simulator.</p><p>The game takes place between the events of <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em> and puts players in the role of Kay Vess, a low-level criminal who gets in way over her head very quickly. She‚Äôs a wise-cracking Han Solo type with an adorable companion named Nix who is half puppy, half axolotl. The setup is a cliche crime caper: Kay joins a crew to pull off one huge score, with plans to retire safely on all the cash she‚Äôs about to steal. Things go sideways, and not only is Kay left penniless ‚Äî she has also pissed off an incredibly rich and powerful member of the criminal underworld. Whoops!</p><p>From there, the story takes an interesting turn, and the rest of the game is spent preparing for another crack at the loot. That means Kay has to build up her underworld credentials by taking on jobs, find a crew that can help pull off the heist successfully, and generally improve her skills and gear for a better shot. It‚Äôs a fun premise that works well with the open-world structure, ensuring everything you do in the game is building toward a big payoff at the end.</p><p>Perhaps the most unique thing about the game is the way factions work. There are four criminal syndicates you‚Äôll be dealing with, and your status with them will change over the course of the game depending on what you do. Taking on a mission to appease the Crimson Dawn might piss off their rivals, for instance, and dealing with them all can feel like spinning plates. Getting in the good graces of a gang opens up new mission paths and other opportunities, while angering them can make certain areas off limits and ‚Äî if things get really bad ‚Äî have them attack you on sight. It doesn‚Äôt fundamentally change the game, but the structure does force you to make some interesting and occasionally tough decisions about whose side you‚Äôre on.</p><div><p><h4>A word on Nix</h4></p><p>I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt talk about Nix. No new <em>Star Wars</em> story is complete without a cuddly animal or droid, Kay‚Äôs adorable companion is arguably the most memorable part of <em>Outlaws</em>. Not only is he cute, but helpful; the little guy can distract enemies and cameras, flip hard-to-reach switches, and aid in fights. Plus, you can head to certain food vendors and share a meal with Nix, which involves an incredibly indulgent minigame that is just the cutest. (Animals are a highlight of the game, as you can pet all kinds of intergalactic critters.)</p></div><p>Much like with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the <em>Star Wars Jedi</em> series</a>, if you‚Äôre simply looking to be taken to a galaxy far, far away, <em>Outlaws</em> is a great option. There‚Äôs nothing quite like racing across the deserts of Tatooine on a speeder bike or landing on a new planet and heading into the local cantina to ask around. All of the details ‚Äî the visuals, the sound, the storylines ‚Äî feel perfectly like, well, <em>Star Wars</em>. Like you‚Äôre in one of the movies, able to walk around and soak in the details.</p><p>I always love market scenes in fantasy and sci-fi; they‚Äôre a great way to quickly get a sense of the culture of a place at a glance. And I spent far too much time in <em>Outlaws</em> wandering around <a href="https://www.threads.net/@andrewwebster/post/C_IqhpAJuWh">snapping photos of street food vendors</a> and watching patrons in cantinas. It‚Äôs not only a way to feel immersed in <em>Star Wars</em> in a way that‚Äôs impossible in other mediums, but it often pays to linger; multiple times, I leaned against a wall on a crowded street, only to overhear details for an interesting side quest.</p><p>Part of what makes this work is how dense <em>Outlaws</em> is. As opposed to, say, <em>Starfield</em> or <em>No Man‚Äôs Sky</em>, sci-fi games that offer giant ‚Äî but mostly empty ‚Äî planets to explore, <em>Outlaws</em> is more practical in scale. There are a handful of worlds, and while each has some open expanses to drive through, most of your time is spent in cities, settlements, bases, and other detailed and busy spaces. This doesn‚Äôt make <em>Outlaws</em> feel small, but rather more human in scope. You don‚Äôt need to spend hours scouring through nothingness to feel like you‚Äôve seen what the game has to offer.</p><p>The problem is that what you‚Äôre doing at any given moment is largely identical to every other open-world game of the last few years. The missions revolve around either sneaking into an enemy base to steal something or going somewhere to collect an item and return it. There‚Äôs lots of crawling through vents, disabling cameras and alarms, and shootouts with very dumb stormtroopers and criminal thugs. Sometimes, you have a choice for how you approach a mission ‚Äî you might sneak in the back door, versus going in guns blazing ‚Äî but mostly, the moment-to-moment action follows a familiar pattern.</p><p>As opposed to a game like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, where you have the tools to approach missions in inventive ways, in <em>Outlaws</em>, you‚Äôre largely following one of a handful of predetermined paths. Worse still, the game often forces you into specific modes, most notably some very tedious stealth sequences. It‚Äôs a structure seen across so many games in the genre, from <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em> to <em>Horizon</em> to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>; I was having <em>a lot</em> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> flashbacks during my playthrough.</p><p>How much you enjoy your time with <em>Outlaws</em> will depend on how much you want to live this fantasy. The underworld of <em>Star Wars</em> has always had some of the universe‚Äôs most interesting stories and characters, and here‚Äôs a chance to experience it all firsthand. That involves some plodding missions and conventional gameplay, which can be a tough sell if you‚Äôre burned out on open-world games already. But when you‚Äôre on edge infiltrating Jabba‚Äôs palace or enjoying the sights and sounds of the bustling Canto Bight, it‚Äôs easy to forget all of that for a few blissful moments.</p><p><small>Star Wars Outlaws <em>launches August 30th on the PC, Xbox, and PS5.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This robot replica has been a recurring antagonist throughout the franchise since his debut on <em>Sonic CD</em> in 1993. He‚Äôs meant to be a mechanical equal to Sonic under Robotnik‚Äôs control, though he‚Äôs gone rogue before and ended up a threat to both his rival and his creator. If Robotnik is looking for an edge in his plot to take over the world, having someone just as fast and strong as his archnemesis is a pretty logical move, and using one of his quills to power the thing makes a lot of sense.<br></p><p>Part of me is a little skeptical of this because the movies have already given Sonic a rival character in Shadow. Metal Sonic is full of his own complexities and insecurities surrounding his inability to defeat Sonic that are different from those of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208">Keanu Reeves‚Äô brooding baddy</a></span>, but I can imagine <em>Sonic 4</em> feeling a bit samey if it‚Äôs two hedgehogs duking it out again like it will be in this movie. However, I could see Metal Sonic becoming a much bigger threat if the movies adapted parts of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-best-games-adventure-heroes-frontiers-generations-1851449449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-best-games-adventure-heroes-frontiers-generations-1851449449"><em>Sonic Heroes</em></a></span>. Metal Sonic was the twist villain of the 2003 game, and every hero, antihero, and villain had to team up to take him down after he became mad with power. If the movies loosely adapt that concept, Metal Sonic could become a Thanos-like figure in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe. If the next movie and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/96566779?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/96566779?utm_campaign=postshare_creator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored spin-off shows</a></span> build the cast to include missing fan favorites like Rouge the Bat and Amy Rose, a <em>Sonic 4 </em>movie<em> </em>that delivers an <em>Avengers</em>-style<em> </em>moment against Metal Sonic sounds plausible.</p><p>I sometimes feel like the <em>Sonic </em>movies moved ahead too quickly to Shadow, as I don‚Äôt think there are that many characters that can bring out the same <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851">excitement people are feeling around <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a></span>. But the first trailer already shows that the movies aren‚Äôt entirely beholden to the same stories as the games, so there‚Äôs room for Paramount to find creative ways to bring these characters into the fold. My one worry about Metal Sonic is that he‚Äôd require the presence of Robotnik, so it seems contingent on whether or not Carrey would return for a fourth movie.

<p>The next game in the Witcher franchise is set to enter production soon. In a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-looks-back-at-the-first-half-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new statement</a> during its first half earnings report, CD Projekt Red join CEO Michal Nowakowsi said the the new Witcher game is close to leaving preproduction.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWork on Polaris is progressing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIts development team is nearing a major milestone which will mark the end of the preproduction phase.‚Äù</p>



<p>Currently, there are 410 people working Polaris ‚Äî the codename for the next Witcher title. That‚Äôs just under 65% of the entire company. Back in January, Joint CEO Adam Badowski <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-polaris-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the goal</a> was to have over 400 people working on the game this year. As of June 30, that number has been reached.</p>



<p>Polaris is the beginning of a new Witcher saga that will span another new Trilogy for the series. It will also see, in some form, a continuation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-geralts-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geralt of Rivia‚Äôs story</a>. Other details about the game, however, are known just yet. </p>

Set in the heart of a Zombie outbreak, the map features VHS rental stores, cozy shops, and sidequests for players to explore.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jswLipfg94" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7jswLipfg94" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each map will have its own unique weapon, and for Liberty Falls, players can equip a jet engine that can suck up zombies and shred them up into bloody chunks. There are also new traps, including a life-size action figure in the comic-book store that can fire heat-vision beams from its eyes and slice up any zombies inside.</p><p>This year's Zombies offering looks like a return to the basics of the popular mode, as players will have to deal with the undead menace in a traditional round-based format. There'll be two maps at launch--the small town of Liberty Falls and the Terminus prison--and players can expect a mode that'll make them sweat as they deal with hordes of enemies.</p><p>There are some interesting mutations to Zombies this year, and overall, Treyarch is aiming to make the mode feel rewarding while also growing the community of Zombies players. For example, the Essence currency can be used to unlock new routes of escape or spent on Perks to strengthen yourself against the ever-increasing challenge of the sprinting undead.</p><p>The other form of currency, Salvage, is found randomly from fallen enemies and can be spent on improving your equipment. Two big quality-of-life changes with Salvage are that you won‚Äôt have to worry about teammates picking up your loot, as it's players-specific and there's only type of Salvage now, compared to the normal and High-Grade Salvage that could be collected in Black Ops Cold War.</p><p>Another big change this year is the introduction of more movement options, as for the first time ever, players can sprint, slide, and dive in any direction while chaining combat maneuvers together. This is part of the Omnimovement system being introduced in Black Ops 6, which is one of the major upgrades to Call of Duty this year.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on Friday, October 25, for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. Game Pass subscribers will get access to the full game as part of their membership, but this doesn't apply to Game Pass Core or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-not-a-day-one-game-pass-release-for-the-new-tier/1100-6524833/" data-ref-id="1100-6524833">new Game Pass Standard tier</a> subscribers.

Earlier this year, Chris Barrett, a senior figure at Bungie and the project lead on its Marathon reboot, was reported to have left the studio - and a new report has shed fresh light on his departure, claiming he was ousted after an internal investigation into inappropriate behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Back in March, IGN reported former Valorant game director Joe Ziegler had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">taken over Barrett's role</a> on the Marathon reboot as part of a creative leadership shake-up at Bungie. Now, however, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claims Barrett was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior">fired from the studio this spring</a>, after being accused of inappropriate behaviour by "at least eight" female employees.
</p>
<p>
Speaking directly to some of the women who had originally filed complaints against Barrett, alongside a number of employees involved in Bungie's investigation, Bloomberg reports Barrett repeatedly befriended women at the studio then subjected them to "a barrage of text messages that blurred the lines between professional and personal". Texts seen by Bloomberg - described as "unwanted" and "uncomfortable" by the women that received them - included "flirtatious messages... and requests to hang out".

<p>
According to Schreier, Bungie's HR investigation ultimately found Barrett - who had been with the company since 1999 and worked as both an artist and game director prior to his departure - had "called lower-level female employees attractive, asked them to play truth-or-dare and made references to his wealth and power within the studio, suggesting that he could help advance their careers".
</p>
<p>
In a response provided to Bloomberg, Barrett said, "I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends. I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry."
</p>
<p>
Bungie's Marathon reboot, now helmed by Joe Ziegler, is currently expected to release next year. Bungie said the project was one of its key focuses, alongside Destiny, following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">lay off 220 staff</a> - around 17 percent of the studio's workforce - back in July. Those layoffs came after 100 job cuts last October, and saw many former and current Bungie employees <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">calling for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/september-2024-ps-plus-monthly-games-confirmed-quidditch-champions-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has confirmed the monthly games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> in September 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include wizardly sports, American sports, and small person horrors.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs see what they are!</p>


<h2>What are the PS Plus September 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 3rd September</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quidditch Champions</strong></li>
<li><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></li>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares II</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You know what you‚Äôre getting with MLB The Show, which is the most accurate and visually impressive game of baseball out there. Developed by San Diego Studio, this is a homegrown first party title, even if it‚Äôs no longer a PlayStation exclusive. So, as we come to the end of the MLB season, why not throw it onto PS Plus to gather as many interested players as possible?</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions ‚Äì Official Trailer ‚Äì 'Magic is in the Air'" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7b6P60X9xB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What‚Äôs a bit less known is what Quidditch Champions will really be like, as the game will join PS Plus on day one. A video game version of the wizarding sport from Harry Potter, the rules to this game have always been a bit of a joke for how massively overpowered catching the Golden Snitch is to winning a match. Still, you‚Äôll be able to customise your character and play as a Chaser, Seeker, Beater and Keeper, and there will be both some broomstick adventures and competitive multiplayer.</p>


<p>And finally, with Little Nightmares III around the corner, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II</a> is now a monthly game for PS Plus. Looking back on our review, Tuff said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rather obvious, but if you enjoyed the first Little Nightmares then you will enjoy the Little Nightmares II. While some new elements have been added it is more of a next chapter to the story than a full blown sequel. The attention detail is incredible, bringing the story to life without a single spoken word. It‚Äôs unsettling, creepy, darkly amusing, and at times a little frustrating, but immensely enjoyable. Another little, slime covered gem from Tarsier Studios.‚Äù</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month‚Äôs games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the August 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab August‚Äôs titles up until the new set of game‚Äôs arrives on 3rd September, so make sure to grab a pretty great Lego game while you can!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (PS4/PS5)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs Security Breach (PS4/PS5)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights (PS4)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The director behind Marathon at Bungie was fired this year due to inappropriate conduct. According to Bloomberg, Chris Barrett was fired from Bungie in the spring after being accused by ‚Äúseveral female employees of inappropriate behavior‚Äù.</p>



<p>Per the report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, ‚Äúat least‚Äù eight female employees came forward against Barrett to the company. From their an investigation took place. That investigation discovered that Barrett would call lower-level employees attractive while also asking them to play truth-or-dare. On top of that, Barrett reported flaunted his ‚Äúwealth and power‚Äù within the company while hinting that he could help people advance their careers.</p>

<p>Messages that were sent to Schreier showed requests to hang out with the women involved as well as texts that were ‚Äúflirtatious‚Äù. It was also said that Barrett‚Äôs interactions with the women had ‚Äúsimilar patterns‚Äù.</p>



<p>‚ÄúBarrett would befriend women at the studio in various departments and then send them a barrage of text messages that blurred the lines between professional and personal,‚Äù Schreier wrote.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Barrett apologized for making people feel uncomfortable while adding that was never his intention.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends,‚Äù  he said. ‚ÄúI never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.‚Äù</p>



<p>Schreier says that Sony, Bungie‚Äôs parent company, wouldn‚Äôt comment on the case. However, he was given a standard response from a spokesperson saying that the company takes all complaints of misconduct seriously.</p>



<p>Employees at Bungie weren‚Äôt told that Barrett was fired or why he was no longer with the company.</p>

			<p>Call of Duty: NEXT Showcase is officially underway, and there, people will get to experience reveals of features from the upcoming shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-pc-requirements-revealed/">Early Access period</a> for the game isn't far away either, officially opening up to players in two days. Below is the official CODNEXT Showcase, which gives excited fans glimpses into the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="#CODNext Showcase | Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone &amp; more" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brzOBsdEAf8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By tuning into the showcase, those who are already active COD players will be given rewards for their dedication to the live stream, with the rewards scaling as you dedicate more time to watching the live stream. At CODNext, Treyarch and Raven have teamed up with content creators who cover the franchise and has given them access to the game to experience and showcase the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer and give commentary while they play through it.</p>
<p>If you're watching along at home, you can get the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-event-code-bowl-v-black-ops-6-beta-intel#NEXT-Rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following rewards</a> for tuning in. Here are the rewards you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 minutes: "Mine" emblem</li>
<li>60 minutes: "Earning Stripes" Calling Card</li>
<li>90 minutes: "Tri Harder" Charm</li>
<li>120 minutes: "The Redactor" Weapon Blueprint</li>
</ul>
<p>Excited fans will also get to hear the developers talk about their journey creating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and some of the most crucial features being added to the upcoming game, such as Omnimovement. They will also discuss the multiplayer maps that have been added to the game and the choices behind the ones they added, with a deep dive into the map design. Taking feedback from players across previous Call of Duty games, the developers sat down and spoke about how they wanted to add in those gunfight scenarios from the Cold War and wanted players to experience plenty of "controlled chaos."</p>
<p>For those who prefer to avoid traditional multiplayer, there are also many discussions about the Zombies aspect of Black Ops 6, a well-loved feature that has appeared in many previous Call of Duty games, and how they looked at prior iterations of the game mode and what made it so special, while also looking to the future to see how they can provide a modern twist on the game mode.</p>
<p>So far, from what is currently being showcased at the CODNEXT Showcase, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is shaping up to be a very smooth experience, with fast-paced combat with new weaponry and even more flair in executions with the usage of omnimovement. By adding omnimovement back into the game, it allows for an even quicker battle, as you can run, jump and slide anywhere you like to gain an advantage over your opponent.</p>

<p>CODNext officially premiered today (August 28, 2024), showcasing Black Ops 6 and its multiplayer mode. With the new omni movement, Call of Duty is preparing to change how the game is played completely. </p>



<p>The new omni movement was not the only feature shown at CODNext, though. The event introduced many new maps, some classic ones, how players can get the beta and more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-codnext-displays-new-omni-movement-feature-for-black-ops-6">CODNext Displays New Omni Movement Feature For Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>One of the biggest features that is new with Black Ops 6 is the omni movement. Since the game first announced the feature, gamers have been anticipating getting a chance to try the new movement out, finally.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>So, what is omni movement? The new feature allows players to slide and jump in all directions. No more jumping just up or forward and only being able to slide forward. Players can slide backward and sideways and even jump out of the water in a diving motion.</p>



<p>There will be an omni movement practice course released with the game and will even be available in the beta.</p>



<p>How does a player get access to the beta, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-access-to-black-ops-6-beta">How To Get Access To Black Ops 6 Beta</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6‚Äôs beta officially drops on <strong>August 30, 2024</strong>. While some of the biggest creators that got to attend CODNext got to test the game out already, other gamers will be able to join in on the action in just a few days.</p>



<p>Those who have pre-ordered the game will get instant access to the beta. Those who also have Game Pass will get access to the beta. So, be sure to purchase one of the two now, and get your beta pre-downloaded.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-maps-will-be-in-multiplayer">How Many Maps Will Be In Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>As of now, there will be 16 maps in multiplayer. However, there will be new (and classic) maps introduced with every new season.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-maps-in-black-ops-6">All Maps In Black Ops 6:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Protocol</li>



<li>Payback</li>



<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Lowtown</li>



<li>Subsonic</li>



<li>Rewind</li>



<li>Scud</li>



<li>Redcard</li>



<li>Babylon</li>



<li>Derelict</li>



<li>Vorkuta</li>



<li>Vault</li>



<li>Sandhouse</li>



<li>Stakeout</li>



<li>Gala</li>



<li>Pit</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>The beta, however, will only include eight of these maps.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-maps-in-black-ops-6-beta">All Maps In Black Ops 6 Beta:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Rewind</li>



<li>Scud</li>



<li>Babylon</li>



<li>Derelict</li>



<li>Stakeout</li>



<li>Gala</li>



<li>Pit</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional maps to be added later this year and next will re-introduce some favorites from the Black Ops universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-mode-added">New Mode Added</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 will also introduce a brand new game mode called Kill Order. The game mode was described as a combination of Slayer and Objective Mode. </p>



<p>Every team in Kill Order will have a High-Value Target (HVT) that they must protect while simultaneously trying to destroy their opposing team‚Äôs. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While points still count per kill from each player, you will get more points by destroying your opponent‚Äôs HVT or if your HVT gets a kill.</p>



<p>There were also some additional changes to other modes. Domination will bring back objectives and Hardpoint is adding numbers to Object Icons to help make callouts much easier for players.</p>



<p>Overall, it seems like Black Ops 6 is going in the right direction in hopes of putting the Call of Duty multiplayer scene back at the top.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe wanted to honor the original game‚Äôs legacy while introducing it to a new audience,‚Äù said Mike Arkin, Argonaut Games Co-CEO, va release. ‚ÄúThe HD remaster allows us to do just that. It‚Äôs been a labor of love for our team, and we can‚Äôt wait to share it with players on all the current consoles and PC later this year.‚Äù</p>



<p>Founder Jez San added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled to see the Argonaut name back after twenty years away. Argonaut was always about pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in gaming, and I‚Äôm excited to see how the relaunched Argonaut Games builds on that legacy.‚Äù</p>



<p>The Croc Legends of the Gobbos Remaster will feature new HD graphics, updated modern controls, and a ‚Äúnostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience.‚Äù The remaster will also include a ‚ÄúCrocipedia‚Äù which Argonaut calls an ‚Äúextensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long-lost development assets such as game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and much more.‚Äù</p>



<p>An official release date will be announced in at a later time.</p>

<!-- cache miss 56:single/related:3aa6196d0f834ce92a8ca73c02f2f563 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Tuesday, researchers from Google and Tel Aviv University unveiled <a href="https://gamengen.github.io/">GameNGen</a>, a new AI model that can interactively simulate the classic 1993 first-person shooter game <em>Doom</em> in real time using AI image generation techniques borrowed from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a>. It's a neural network system that can function as a limited game engine, potentially opening new possibilities for real-time video game synthesis in the future.</p>
<p>For example, instead of drawing graphical video frames using traditional techniques, future games could potentially use an AI engine to "imagine" or hallucinate graphics in real time as a prediction task.</p>

<p>"<span>The potential here is absurd," <a href="https://x.com/NickADobos">wrote</a> app developer Nick Dobos in reaction to the news. "Why write complex rules for software by hand when the AI can just think every pixel for you?"</span></p>
<p><span>GameNGen can reportedly generate new frames of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> gameplay at over 20 frames per second using a single tensor processing unit (TPU), a type of specialized processor similar to a GPU that is optimized for machine learning tasks.</span></p>
<p>In tests, the researchers say that ten human raters sometimes failed to distinguish between short clips (1.6 seconds and 3.2 seconds) of actual <em>Doom</em> game footage and outputs generated by GameNGen, identifying the true gameplay footage 58 percent or 60 percent of the time.</p>

<p>Real-time video game synthesis using what might be called "<a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1300252019534462977">neural rendering</a>" is not a completely novel idea. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rtx-off-ai-on-jensen-says-well-see-fully-ai-generated-games-in-5-10-years">predicted</a> during an interview in March, perhaps somewhat boldly, that most video game graphics could be generated by AI in real time within five to 10 years.</p>
<p>GameNGen also builds on previous work in the field, cited in the GameNGen paper, that includes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122">World Models</a> in 2018, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12126">GameGAN</a> in 2020, and Google's own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">Genie</a> in March. And a group of university researchers trained an AI model (called "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12399">DIAMOND</a>") to simulate vintage Atari video games using a diffusion model earlier this year.</p>
<p>Also, ongoing research into "<a href="https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-general-world-models">world models</a>" or "<a href="https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/">world simulators</a>," commonly associated with AI video synthesis models like Runway's Gen-3 Alpha and OpenAI's Sora, is leaning toward a similar direction. For example, during the debut of Sora, OpenAI showed demo videos of the AI generator <a href="https://gizmodo.com/openai-sora-is-coming-for-your-video-games-1851264042">simulating <em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Diffusion is key</h2>
<p>In a preprint research paper titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14837">Diffusion Models Are Real-Time Game Engines</a>," authors Dani Valevski, Yaniv Leviathan, Moab Arar, and Shlomi Fruchter explain how GameNGen works. Their system uses a modified version of Stable Diffusion 1.4, an image synthesis diffusion model released in 2022 that people use to produce AI-generated images.</p>
<p>"Turns out the answer to 'can it run <em>DOOM</em>?' is yes for diffusion models," <a href="https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1828618060997239253">wrote</a>&nbsp;Stability AI Research Director Tanishq Mathew Abraham, who was not involved with the research project.</p>

<p>While being directed by player input, the diffusion model predicts the next gaming state from previous ones after having been trained on extensive footage of <em>Doom</em> in action.</p>
<p>The development of GameNGen involved a two-phase training process. Initially, the researchers trained a reinforcement learning agent to play <em>Doom</em>, with its gameplay sessions recorded to create an automatically generated training dataset‚Äîthat footage we mentioned. They then used that data to train the custom Stable Diffusion model.</p>
<p>However, using Stable Diffusion introduces some graphical glitches, as the researchers note in their abstract: "The pre-trained auto-encoder of Stable Diffusion v1.4, which compresses 8√ó8 pixel patches into 4 latent channels, results in meaningful artifacts when predicting game frames, which affect small details and particularly the bottom bar HUD."</p>

<p>And that's not the only challenge. Keeping the images visually clear and consistent over time (often called "temporal coherency" in the AI video space) can be a challenge. GameNGen researchers say that "interactive world simulation is more than just very fast video generation," as they write in their paper. "The requirement to condition on a stream of input actions that is only available throughout the generation breaks some assumptions of existing diffusion model architectures," including repeatedly generating new frames based on previous ones (called "autoregression"), which can lead to instability and a rapid decline in the quality of the generated world over time.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft is apparently using the Force to make some PS5 players of Star Wars Outlaws restart their adventures in a galaxy far, far away. A new patch for the game--which is only available early for Gold and Ultimate Edition owners--requires people to begin again unless they want to encounter "issues and progression blockers."</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-patch-1000002-new-save-ubisoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6515795/" data-ref-id="1100-6515795">Star Wars Outlaws</a> players on PS5 receiving a message about patch 1.000.002 that discusses their save file for the game. The 8.5GB update for Sony's system reportedly addresses bug issues and adds a 40fps mode, but it's also apparently causing headaches for people who have already spent hours playing Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the message Ubisoft has reportedly sent out:</p><p>"To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game. As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused... Once you‚Äôve confirmed you have the latest version, please start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended. If you continue on a prior save you will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="489157459" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
