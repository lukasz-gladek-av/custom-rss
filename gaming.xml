While Wizards of the Coast's promotional drops have featured crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-magic-gathering-secret-lair-x-hatsune-miku-revealed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hatsune Miku</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-secret-lair-summer-superdrop-2024-brings-assassins-creed-and-hatsune-miku" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Assassins Creed</em></a>, the new Brain Dead Secret Lair will showcase the work of the Los Angeles-based artist collective.</p>
<h2>The Brain Dead Secret Lair Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the Brain Dead Secret Lair was announced as part of their upcoming Inside and Elevator Superdrop. The Secret Lair is comprised of three different drops, <em>Brain Dead: Creatures</em>, <em>Brain Dead: Lands</em>, and <em>Brain Dead: Staples</em>.</p>

<ul><li><em>Consecrated Sphinx</em></li>
<li><em>Chaotic Goo</em></li>
<li><em>Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</em></li>
<li><em>Meteor Golem</em></li>

As the name implies, the drop will contain two copies of all five basic land cards. One will feature art by Lindstein; the other by Reavis.</p>
<p>Lastly, <em>Brain Dead: Staples</em> will contain cards every player needs in Commander. These titular staple cards will get treatments by Bardo Bread and Jackson Epstein. Those cards are as follows:</p>

In addition, Brain Dead will launch a collection of Secret Lair-themed merchandise Tuesday, July 30.</p>
<h2>The <em>Magic: Online</em> Vintage Cube Live Tournament</h2>
<p>In addition to the Brain Dead Secret Lair, Wizards of the Coast announced a massive Vintage Cube tournament for <em>Magic: The Gathering Online</em>. The twist is that finalists in this Vintage Cube Live tournament will attend a physical event at MagicCon: Las Vegas and draft cards from an actual Vintage prize cube valued at $65,000.</p>
<p>On top of that, all eight finalists will get to keep the decks they drafted. The press release even confirms the Power Nine, including the iconic Black Lotus, will be present in these packs.</p>
<p>If you want to secure your place in the Vintage Cube Live tournament, just complete the following steps. Sweep a MagicCon Draft League to earn a 64-Player Draft Entry Token. Win a MagicCon 64-Player Draft, which will earn you a Vegas Qualifier. Finally, go 3-0 in the Vegas Qualifier. Good luck.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-new-game-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Robot Entertainment, the developers behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/orcs-must-die-3-reinforcing-the-genre/">Orcs Must Die</a>, has announced a new game for the franchise. The latest game is titled Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap will feature a multiplayer game mode for the first time. For those attending Gamescom, this will be the first time that people will be able to get a hands-on experience with the new game and provide feedback for the developers on their game.</p>
<p>For those who aren't going to Gamescom, you'll have to wait until 2025 to get your hands on this new Orcs Must Die game. It will come to Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and the Epic Games Store in early 2025.</p>
<p>This game features War Mages with unique weaponry, abilities, traps, and personalities that make them all lovable (or hateable.) Each hero in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap has its play style to ensure that there is something for everyone to enjoy. This means that they can either work well on their own or have synergies in a team through the multiplayer game mode.</p>
<p>Whether you're someone who likes to play the game by themselves or you want to team up with friends, you can now do it in multiplayer game mode with up to four players. Adding more players comes with challenges and unique rewards to help you progress as a team throughout the game.</p>
<p>To keep the game fresh and replayable, no two runs will ever be the same. Each new run will have you facing off against new beasts and enemies with randomized buffs and debuffs that can stack. These debuffs can affect your hero's weapons, abilities, stats, and overall levels. The more debuffs and enemy buffs you pick up, the more complex the boss fight will be at the end when you think you've nearly succeeded.</p>
<p><iframe title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2PNXZ_Ea7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game comes with third-person shooter and melee combat, making it an intense experience but leaving you feeling victorious when you are successful in battle. Alongside the combat are the hectic physics-based interactions you can have with the enemies and hilarious ragdoll effects that can send your enemies wobbling through the air. You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2PNXZ_Ea7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official reveal trailer</a> above and see if it deserves a place on your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam wishlist</a>.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into Zenless Zone Zero and feeling overwhelmed by the number of options for creating a team, don't panic. Some characters are objectively better than others, while others may choose to play simply because you like them. There are no rules to playing Zenless Zone Zero. However, if you need guidance, keep reading for our <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a> best agents tier list.</p>
<p>The higher-tier characters are great if you want to take on some of the more challenging parts of the game, such as Hollow Zero, Notorious Hunt, and Shiyu Defense. While you could probably make it through with the base characters you're given, there are characters on this Zenless Zone Zero tier list that will make your journey significantly easier.</p>

<h2>S Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Ellen is a powerhouse that uses Slash damage combined with Ice attacks. Even when not leveled up, her damage is significantly better than everyone else's. When she is teamed up with other S-tiers, the damage is immense. When paired with Lycaon and Soukaku, she has a great synergy with them. Using her Roaming state, she can quickly build up Flash Freeze charges, which can help stop an enemy in their tracks.</p>
<p>Lycaon has Ice Stun attacks as well as Strike damage. Not only is Lycaon great as a support character due to their increased Stun duration and Ice Resistance Shredding. Lycaon is a real asset, along with some of the other powerhouses that were in attack. Even if you aren't quite sure how to use this character, you can still output some beefy damage. Learn how to charge correctly and combo his attacks. Lycaon is one of the best characters you can put on your team.</p>
<p>Rina is an Electric support with Strike damage. While she can be challenging to get used to at first due to her slow attack speed, the overall group damage output can be boosted by utilizing her. Using her special attacks and then swapping to another character in the party can boost your damage numbers, and even when swapped, she will continue to do damage to the enemies. While in a support role, she's excellent at adding chip damage to the overall output.</p>
<h2>A Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Grace is an Electric Anomaly with Pierce damage. Compared to some of the other characters on this list, Grace can be really demanding in learning to play correctly. To be able to play her, you need to be mindful of how many stacks you have built up, as well as how often you are swapping in and out. While she is not a proper DPS, she can have some excellent damage output if she is adequately utilized and works well with other Electric-type characters.</p>
<p>Lucy is a Fire Support that deals Strike damage. Lucy can be a great asset to the team, as she has phenomenal support capabilities and great DPS. When paired with other Fire users, she has some great benefits. You'll have a great time utilizing Lucy on your team with minimal struggle by summoning her guard boars and pulling off successful EX special attacks. The small boars are a great asset as they scale off Lucy's critical strike and damage.</p>
<p>Soldier 11 is a Fire Attack using Slash damage. Soldier 11 is the only Fire attacker in the game, making her the perfect DPS to take into a fight where the enemies are susceptible to Fire. To make the most of Soldier 11, you need to get your timing down for her basic attacks so that she can perform combos that make the most of her Fire buff. While this may sound scary, it's very easy to perform; it just takes a little while to get into the flow.</p>
<p>Soukaku is an Ice Support with Slash damage. Soukaku is probably the trickiest character to learn to play out of the Zenless Zone Zero A-tiers, but she is still a solid pick. You must know how to time her basic attacks to pull off her combos and maximize her support capabilities. After successfully performing her combo, she gives buffs to her fellow agents' next attack, allowing the buffed agent to do much damage. Due to her being an Ice Support, she is best paired with other Ice agents.</p>
<h2>B Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Anby uses an Electric Stun with Strike damage. She is one of the free characters you get at the start of the game and is incredibly beneficial to have and level up. When paired with either more Electric squad members or members from the Cunning Hares, she has some great synergy with them. Her kit is far from complicated, and her combo is effortless. By utilizing it properly, she has powerful damage and a Daze boost after the third hit of her basic attack.</p>
<p>Ben is a Fire Defense that uses Strike damage. Ben is an excellent asset to the team purely because of the shield he can grant his entire squad after using a follow-up attack during his EX Special Attack. By using this, it also increases the Crit Strike for the team. The biggest downside to having Ben on your team is how slow they are on the battlefield, with other support characters doing a better job than them.</p>
<p>Koleda is a Fire Stun with Strike damage. Koleda comes as one of the most unique characters in the game, as her full potential isn't unleashed unless she is paired with Ben, which then boosts Ben in return. However, they are both incredibly slow attackers, which can make brutal fights extremely long, whereas in Zenless Zone Zero, speed is vital.</p>
<p>Nekomata is a Physical Attacker with Slash damage. If you like fast-paced action, Nekomata is the perfect pick for you. Compared to other agents in the game, Nekomata is top of the tier list for her physical damage output. However, she is very difficult to put on a team, as Piper is the only person she benefits from having on a team with her. To utilize Nekomata, you must have your timing on dodging and attacking down to a T.</p>
<p>Nicole is an Ether Support with Strike damage. Nicole would probably be a great asset if you're curating Ether teams. However, there are no other Ether agents, so it's unsure whether she would excel. While she gains and gives buffs to the other Cunning Hares if you pair them up, they aren't as good as some other team buffs. Once Zhu Yuan is released, Nicole may stand a chance at being helpful, especially with her Energy Fields.</p>
<p>Piper is a Physical Anomaly with Slash damage. Piper is a huge asset to the team as she can quickly build up and apply her Physical Anomaly using her EX Special Attack and boost the rest of the team's damage output. If you also need some stuns, Piper has great stun potential, especially if you're good at swapping out your characters on time.</p>
<h2>C Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Anton is an Electric Attack with Pierce damage. As it stands, Anton is the only Electric Attacker in the game. On top of that, his kit can be a bit difficult to utilize correctly, as it's hard to get his full damage potential out. He needs to be in Burst Mode to pump the damage consistently. However, as he is in Burst Mode, he loses energy, making tackling challenging.</p>
<p>Corin is a Physical Attack with Slash damage. Corin is most likely one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-claim-all-180-free-pulls-in-zenless-zone-zero/">first agents you'll unlock</a> outside of the free agents given to you. Despite this, they can be beneficial. When dealing with crowd control situations, Corin is the perfect agent for the job. While her damage output is slightly lower than some of the other Zenless Zone Zero agents on this tier list, she can apply Daze with her assistance and does increased damage to stunned enemies.</p>
<h2>D Tier Characters</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Billy is the only D-tier character on this Zenless Zone Zero tier list. He uses Physical Attacks with Pierce damage. While Billy excels in crowd control, his overall damage is lacking, and you'd be better off building any other attacker. The further an enemy is away from Billy, the less damage he deals. This is difficult to handle, as he is a ranged attacker, but you must be as close as possible to get any good damage numbers out.</p>
<p>That concludes our Zenless Zone Zero tier list. It'll be updated as soon as new characters are released so you can stay on top of the trends and build the most powerful team possible.</p>

To get one of those you’ll need some gunpowder. And for <em>Once Human</em>’s gunpowder, you’ll need to acquire acid. It’s an endless cycle that will see you grinding resource nodes well into the end game.</p><p>To make your journey easier, here is how to acquire acid using various methods, including a passive farming solution that offers a hands-off approach after initial setup!</p><h2 id="h19658"><a id="early"></a>Where to get acid in the early game</h2><p>You won’t be able to farm acid in bulk until the late game. By then, you’ll have unlocked various technologies that will allow you to sift acid from contaminated water, but more on that later.</p><p><strong>Early on, the best way to acquire acid in the early game is by slaying enemies</strong>. Multiple enemy types in low-level zones drop acid, including:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Gnawer</li><li>Charred Maniac</li><li>Light</li></ul><p>You’re most likely to encounter a Gnawer or Charred Maniac, the former of which will always drop a handful of acid on death.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-recommend-id="image://6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-recommend-id="image://6ead116a62014efd4aab90b6e84894c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gnawer stands outside of a construction site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Alternatively, you will acquire junk items from crates, waste bins, and enemies you can bring back to the base.

A few potential spots can be found near:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Greywater Camp</li><li>Lone Wolf Wastes</li><li>Blackfell</li></ul><p><strong>You’ll typically need to be approximately level 20 before it’s wise to venture into a polluted zone.</strong> Most of the technology you require to farm polluted zones for acid requires tier four and five Memetics.</p><p>[Once-Human-Reverse-Osmosis-Purifiers.jpg]</p><p>To get started farming acid passively, you must unlock the following items:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Water Pump</li><li>Reverse Osmosis Purifiers</li><li>Fermentation (Brewing) Barrels</li></ul><p>First, place your Water Pump in polluted water, then power up the unit to ensure it can feed into the Reverse Osmosis Purifiers. As this process proceeds, impure acid is produced.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>impure acid isn’t good enough to craft gunpowder and ammunition</strong>. You must refine the impure acid using the fermentation (brewing) barrels and purified water.</p><p>Once all is said and done, you’ll have a semi-automatic process to farm acid in <em>Once Human</em>. It requires a bit of setup—crafting and grinding—but proves more than worthwhile as you push end-game content with enough ammunition to stave off the apocalypse!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Recent changes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> Classic Era servers are being reverted "immediately," Blizzard has announced, after the developer apologized for failing to discuss "shortsighted" quality-of-life updates to the old-school version of Blizzard's long-running MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">The update, released last week, was originally designed for WoW Classic's more experimental <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">Season of Discovery servers</a>. However, Blizzard intentionally opted to bring some of the changes to the game's non-seasonal Classic Era servers too. Those changes allowed Druids to wield polearms, granted Alliance players a powerful new world buff on par with the Horde's existing Warchief's Blessing buff, and updated the game's guild interface to match that of the modern game.</p><p dir="ltr">Those changes took the Classic Era community, which generally doesn't enjoy major changes to the (for the most part) 2006 version of WoW, by surprise. Players were so surprised, in fact, that many on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1e0azwg/new_classic_era_patch_notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> believed the changes had simply been a mistake on Blizzard's part, only to later learn that the changes were indeed intended. Now, Blizzard said those changes (minus the guild UI) are being removed, citing a "lack of communication" that "was not in line with our values."</p><p dir="ltr">"For everything it does perfectly, Classic Era is also beloved for its wonderful imperfections," Blizzard community manager Kaivax said in an <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-era-patch-updates/1894672" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official post</a> on the Classic Era forums. "These 'perfectly imperfect' elements make up the texture of the overall experience, and we recognize that making changes to these, even with the intent of adding 'quality-of-life' updates--and particularly without discussing them with the community first--was shortsighted. Thank you, again, for your feedback."</p><p dir="ltr">As for the new guild UI, Blizzard said it recognizes the change is "jarring," even though feedback it received from guild leaders so far indicates the updated UI does help improve guild management. Blizzard said it's discussing "additional options" for the guild UI internally and will be looking to the community for feedback on what should be done next.</p><p dir="ltr">"As it stands now, the Classic team philosophically has very little desire to bring gameplay-impacting changes to Classic Era," Blizzard said. "Moving forward, we will endeavor to discuss any potential community-led desire for changes with the community, well in advance of actually implementing any updates."</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-iconic-legendary-weapons-is-getting-an-overhaul-in-season-of-discovery/1100-6524252/" data-ref-id="1100-6524252">Season of Discovery servers recently entered its endgame phase</a>, featuring revamps of existing raids as well as new items, abilities, and even a new dungeon. Meanwhile, Blizzard is gearing up for the release of the 10th expansion for the modern version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">WoW, The War Within, on August 26</a>.</p>

It's summer, the season of occasional sun (hello from the UK) and seemingly ceaseless video game discounts - and up next is Sony, promising <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/16/playstation-stores-summer-sale-starts-july-17/">price reductions on over 4500 digital titles</a> during its newly launched PlayStation Store Summer Sale.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation's summer sale is now live and runs for the next four weeks, coming to a close on Wednesday, 14th August. During that time, you'll find discounts - some fairly sizeable - across PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 games, DLC, and other digital products.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, for instance, currently has 30 percent off, meaning you can pick it up for £34.99 rather than the usual £49.99. Other big names with decent discounts include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (45 percent off), Sea of Thieves (30 percent off), Alan Wake 2 (35 percent off), Resident Evil 4 Remake (25 percent off), Red Dead Redemption 2 (65 percent off), Amored Core 6 (30 percent off), and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is reduced by 35 percent.

<p>
If it's first-party titles you're after, you'll find at least a few squirrelled away in the pages of PlayStation's Summer Sale. There's 42 percent off Marvel's Spider-Man, for instance, 50 percent off Returnal and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, 77 percent off Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (meaning you can pick that one up for a very reasonable tenner), and probably a couple more that have eluded my admittedly fairly cursory investigations.
</p>
<p>
For the remaining 4500-ish discounts, just head over to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/view/7bbceafe-bfa8-11ee-b375-5e45f4e139ac/4ebf500e-3984-11ef-bea7-2625931bc8ce">PlayStation Summer Sale</a> before 14th August. And if anything catches your eye, feel free to share your hearty recommendations / amazing discoveries / stark warnings of potential purchasing misery below.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year.930135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It comes as no surprise that video game sales have dropped worldwide. The UK isn't the only market to see drastic drops, as Europe also experienced heavy drops in <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/">console purchases</a>, especially for Xbox. In the first half of the fiscal year in the UK, video game sales have dropped by a significant 30%.</p>
<p>Many people knew there would be more of a struggle, as there haven't been many "hit" games in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023. According to figures released by the Entertainment Retailers Association, sales of both physical and digital video games have dropped by 29.4%.</p>
<p>Despite the drastic drop in sales, video game sales were still significantly higher than Music sales, which include Vinyls, CDs, and downloads. These sales do exclude the streaming of music, though. While music sales are relatively low, they have risen 7.9% year-over-year to £163.8 million.</p>
<p>Physical game sales have dropped by 40% year-over-year to £111.7 million, with digital downloads dropping by 23% to £263.9 million. Many factors could be causing the drop in sales, with much of it being attributed to video games being too expensive for many people. Additionally, digital games are often cheaper and can be bought on third-party websites for a significant discount.</p>
<p>"It was a tough first half for the games business with a lack of heavy-hitting releases, but we are optimistic for the second half, the traditional time for blockbuster releases," says <a href="https://www.eraltd.org/music-outpaces-video-and-games-in-first-half-of-2024-with-sales-revenues-up-7-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entertainment Retailers Association</a> CEO Kim Bayley.</p>
<p>With games such as the Silent Hill 2 remake, Super Mario Party Jamboree, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Assassin's Creed Shadows all due to be released in the second half of the year, video game sales may pick up once again.</p>
<p>Video game sales have been struggling immensely in the UK due to the cost-of-living crisis, where people can barely afford to survive, let alone purchase video games. Pair this with the lack of major games being released, and annual video game sales have dropped significantly and have fallen behind movie revenues for the first time since 2012.</p>
<p>Overall, the video games industry has struggled recently, with layoffs, studios closing down, and games being scrapped right before release. It's been a volatile time for the entertainment industry as a whole, and we can only hope it improves before it worsens.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/17/bioware-on-returning-to-the-dragon-age-series-10-years-after-inquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>With 10 years between 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, the most recent release in the series, and the upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latter has much riding on it. It's both a follow-up to a beloved game from a decade ago in one of BioWare’s most beloved series, and it's the first BioWare game since the launch of 2019's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/anthem/grinding-gears#:~:text=Anthem%20should%20have%20been%20all,back%20from%20being%20truly%20engrossing.">Anthem</a>, a live-service multiplayer effort <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/24/anthem-20-canceled-by-bioware">EA sunset less than two years later</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Curious about the pressure surrounding the release of Veilguard, I spoke to BioWare about lessons learned from following up on Inquisition and what it's been like returning to this series so many years later.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="bc45e650-3205-4ae7-b276-95ff203343c7" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>"We start out in pre-production," BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask about BioWare's guiding principle for developing Veilguard. "We spent a lot of time iterating, experimenting, and innovating on different things. At one point, it was multiplayer – we did a hard look at multiplayer, but we felt we really couldn't return to our roots. And when we asked ourselves, 'What is the game that we want to develop,' we really wanted to get back to our roots, which is amazing storytelling. It's about those unforgettable characters. And it's about having the opportunity to influence the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"And we really felt multiplayer wouldn't do that. But single-player RPG is really where we wanted to spend our time, so after spending that time in pre-production, really honing in on what the vision of this game is, and [being] afforded the opportunity to deliver on the creative promise of this game, [now] we're really excited about what's coming out."</p>

<p>McKay says Veilguard blends seasoned veterans with new voices and perspectives, and "that's really important for this game." For example, people like former Dragon Age producer Mark Darrah, who left the studio in 2021 but is now consulting for Veilguard, and creative director John Epler together have decades of experience at BioWare. They work with people like game director Corinne Busche, who joined BioWare shortly after the launch of Anthem (but brings in a love of Dragon Age from the series' 2009 start), every day to develop the game we'll be playing this fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"[You] want to have different perspectives, different backgrounds," McKay says. "If you bring a bunch of people together that have only known one thing, that's not where you see creativity. That's not where innovation comes from. Innovation comes when you have [...] that past history and blend it with some new voices and perspectives."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Darrah has been attached to BioWare in some capacity since its early Baldur's Gate days, and when I ask him about the studio's progression from that series to the next Dragon Age, he says it's been amazing. "The thing that is so amazing about Veilguard is this is the game where we finally said out loud that BioWare's greatest strength is telling stories through characters. If you go all the way back to Baldur's Gate 1, Baldur's Gate 2, these games are telling stories through characters, but there wasn't an intentionality behind that. And in this game, we're finally putting that intentionality first and foremost, putting the characters first, building the game around that, around those character moments, which is really the best way that BioWare knows how to tell stories."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ask Darrah if there's anything Veilguard is doing that BioWare wanted to do on previous games but couldn't, and he says, "Storytelling through animation." In previous games, each character moves in "exactly the same way," and everyone is homogenous in that way, he says. "If you put on a suit of armor, and you put it on Alistair, you looked exactly the same standing right beside each other.</p>

<p>"Now, we're able to keep the character coming through in the visuals and the motion, even as you're customizing them, which just wasn't possible in the past."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also mentions BioWare's confidence in its game development engine for Veilguard, which, like Inquisition, uses EA's proprietary Frostbite. "Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II were doing what they could with the technology they had; Dragon Age: Inquisition did a good job of using Frostbite respective of the engine," Darrah says. "But with this game, there's a better understanding of the engines over a lot more time, but also, the technology of the hardware that the game is going to be played on moving forward [is] able to do a lot more stuff [and] execute it visually to a degree that just wasn't possible in the past."&nbsp;</p>



<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_61F9GBGq4" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>With 10 years between Inquisition and Veilguard, BioWare has to balance satisfying longtime fans of the series with newcomers jumping in for the first time. Epler says the studio worked hard to ensure Veilguard is respectful and referential to previous games without feeling like you need to have played Inquisition, Dragon Age II, or Origins to fully understand what's going on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So while there are references, there are moments that we have callbacks, it really is its own story, its own continuation with a different cast, with different characters," he says. "Historically, Dragon Age has always had a different cast per game, so that gives us a lot of freedom in terms of what we want to lean on in the past and what we want to really bring in that’s new and forward-facing."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Darrah adds that Veilgaurd's events play out with a storytelling goal for the future of the series. "This is a game which takes the ball that Inquisition had, puts its own spin on it, has its own characters, takes its own direction, but continues the path forward into the future," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dragon Age has always been about change. Every game has had a new protagonist, and it's been exploring its own space all the time, and this game is no different. [Veilguard] does a good job of bridging that gap. The really super fans of Dragon Age have actually made a lot of really educated guesses, and some of them are pretty right about where the franchise is going. The thing we need to make sure is that people who may have only played Inquisition are understanding what the franchise is really about – it's about a new protagonist, it's about change, it's about evolution – and don't come in expecting a direct sequel to a game they played and then are disappointed. This game is something new, something that evolves, something that is greater than what came before, the same as each game [...] before it."&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Busche, balancing newcomers and fan expectations in Veilguard is about managing assumptions. She says Veilguard takes place in a part of Thedas BioWare has only hinted at. The team has hinted at the Grey Warden fortress of Weisshaupt, the depths of Arlathan Forest, the Rivain Coast, the Grand Necropolis of Nevarra, and Minrathous, but now players will finally go to these stories' locations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have a rich history of world-building within the IP, so existing players will be familiar with these places and very excited to go to them and explore their mysteries," Busche tells me. "But for our new players, we're not assuming you know anything about these locations. I would say that also extends to the characters; we've taken great care in how we introduce each and every single companion and major story figure within the game [with that in mind]."</p>

<p>Epler tells me that Veilguard differs from Inquisition and other Dragon Age games in the way that Rook, the player character, can't save the world without the characters they meet on their journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dragon Age has always been about characters but to some degree, it's almost felt like we've lucked into that," he says. "Inquisition is a story that ultimately, you, the main character [...] have the biggest part to play. We wanted to tell a story this time where you literally cannot save the world without these characters. Beyond that, though, we also wanted to give them their own arcs that can run parallel to the main story and really give them that kind of deep storytelling our fans really enjoy."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though he's biased for obvious reasons, Epler says Veilguard is his favorite Dragon Age game he's worked on (and he's worked on all of them, starting as a quality assurance tester on Origins). He says one reason for this is the storytelling in the characters, companions, and relationships.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>"They have their friendships, they have their rivalries, and lean into that concept," he tells me. "You're not just pulling together a bunch of people who will do whatever you say. You're assembling a family, and that becomes the core of what the Veilguard is all about. It's about taking this group, this found family, and saving the world, side by side with them."&nbsp;</p>

			<p>For those who love to explore the world of stealth and assassination, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-hitman-1-2-content-free/">HITMAN World of Assassination</a> features a brand new mission in which you can see the iconic Conor McGregor in-game. <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The collaboration</a> has been out for a little while now and will be available until July 29. It's become incredibly popular and has drawn over 150,000 players to the game.</p>
<p>Conor McGregor appears in-game as a combat sports fighter and multi-millionaire, The Disruptor. Not only does it have his voice in the game, but the character features his likeness, too. This mission is available to all players for free through the Free Starter Pack and as an Elusive Target.</p>
<p>The Disruptor is incredibly popular compared to other Elusive Targets in the game. As it stands, 150,000 daily players are trying to make their way through the game to take him down. These statistics come from the indie game developer IO Interactive, responsible for the Hitman franchise.</p>
<p>Currently, only 47% of players who have attempted this mission have successfully eliminated The Disruptor. Many of the player base who have completed the mission went for hand-to-hand combat to get the whole experience rather than assassinating him outright. 27% of players chose to participate in the cage duel with The Disruptor, which completes the mission if done correctly.</p>
<p>The fastest runtime for this mission comes at a snappy 15 seconds, barely giving The Disruptor any time to get his speech in before he is taken down for good. Some players are deciding to have a bit more fun with it, though, and some have decided to take over 16 agonizing hours to get rid of The Disruptor.</p>
<p>IO Interactive released an info graphic that includes all of the details you need to know about how The Disruptor has been killed in people's Hitman III experiences. Some of the wackiest ways to kill him include using a pair of headphones, a Battle Axe, and the Pale Duck.</p>

<p>Today, IO Interactive has released a paid DLC called The Disruptor Pack. This includes The Ostentatious, which grants players permanent access to the Elusive Target, some brand-new cosmetics for the Freelancer Safehouse, and three new items. This also comes The Season of the Disruptor, where new content for HITMAN World of Assassination will be released over the coming weeks, including brand-new challenges and contracts.</p>
<p>For those who want to get their hands on the Disruptor Pack, you can purchase it now for $4.99/£3.99, available on every platform.</p>

It’s a well-deserved nomination for the show, which does an exceptional job of stringing multiple storylines together into a cohesive plot with the signature satirical yet poignant tone of the games. Goggins is equally deserving of praise for essentially pulling double duty as Cooper Howard, a centerpiece in the show’s flashbacks, as well as The Ghoul, a central character in its “current” timeline. Even with these two nominations, it does feel like a snub to leave out Ella Purnell who portrays Lucy, the de facto lead of the show. </p><p>This marks the third year in a row that a video game adaptation has made its way into the nominees. 2022 saw <em>League of Legends</em> show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-arcane-is-the-best-show-on-netflix-ri-1848062117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-arcane-is-the-best-show-on-netflix-ri-1848062117"><em>Arcane</em></a></span> take home Outstanding Animated Program while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-tv-review-pedro-pascal-joel-ellie-bill-1849969496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-tv-review-pedro-pascal-joel-ellie-bill-1849969496">HBO’s<em> The Last of Us</em></a></span> scored 24 nominations (including Outstanding Drama Series) and four wins. This year <em>Fallout </em>should enjoy the honor of being nominated, because there’s a fairly low chance that it (or Goggins) will actually take home an award.

It’s led by legendary actor Hiroyuki Sanada, alongside a bombshell performance from Anna Sawai (both earned nominations) and numerous other memorable supporting actors. <em>Shōgun</em> also becomes the second foreign-language program in the history of the awards to earn a nomination for Original Drama Series—the first being <em>Squid Game</em> in 2022. Interestingly, the first television adaptation of <em>Shōgun </em>also garnered a number of nominations at the 1981 Emmys, eventually taking home the award for Outstanding Limited Series. So as good as <em>Fallout</em> is, it doesn’t seem likely that this will be the year a video game adaptation takes home the big prize.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nearly eight years later, the sci-fi exploration sim looks more stunning than ever in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-patch-5-0-free-helldivers-mechs-1851596276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-patch-5-0-free-helldivers-mechs-1851596276">comprehensive new 5.0 patch</a></span> that adds a bunch of things and changes a ton of other stuff that make the game feel more alive and lived in than ever.<br></p><p>Walking sims sometimes get a bad rep, and several mammoth updates later,<em> No Man’s Sky </em>is everything from a base-building crafting game to an open-world survival shooter.

Even if you’ve never played it before, new shots of rolling fog, ash clouds, and ocean tides help <em>No Man’s Sky </em>tug at your weirdest sci-fi dreams in even more ways.

All of the updates since 2016 have also been free, so no paying extra to nuke bugs with mech flamethrowers in this latest update, either. But one of the best things about <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is that you don’t even need to play it to appreciate its cosmic beauty. Here are 19 screenshots from the new update that will inspire your planetary adventurer for free. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports FC 25 gave <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-fc-25-trailer-and-features-announced/">everyone a first look with its first trailer</a> and features reveal on Wednesday. With all the announcements, however, the biggest might just be the inclusion of a women’s career mode in EA Sports FC 25 for the first time. </p>



<p>“Play an authentic Women’s Career experience using a club or player from the top five women’s leagues,” EA Sports said as part of the reveal. </p>



<p>Those <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/authenticity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leagues include</a> the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL), Barclays Women’s Super League, Liga F, Google Pixel Frauen-Bundesliga, and Arkema Première Ligue. There will also be the UEFA Women’s Champions League within the game for players to enjoy. </p>



<p>It’s been a couple years since the inclusion of the NWSL made its way to EA Sports’ soccer franchise. Since then, the presence of women in the game has only grown into what players will get now.</p>



<p>A full deep dive on how the women’s career mode in EA Sports FC 25 will come prior to the game’s launch. EA Sports FC 25 releases for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch on September 20 for those who purchase the Ultimate Edition of the game. Purchasing the Standard Edition of the game will see the game released on September 20.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-25-71-changes-that-actually-make-a-difference<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Jude Bellingham may not have sealed the perfect season by lifting the Euro 2024 trophy with England, but he does at least have the small consolation of becoming EA FC’s (or FIFA’s) youngest-ever cover star at the age of just 21. EA FC 25 will be released on September 27th, 2024, or a week early on September 20th if you purchase early access. But what’s new this time around? </p><p>For annual sports releases, offering an enticing suite of tweaks and additions is a must to keep things feeling fresh, and with a new 5v5 mode, a completely overhauled approach to tactics, and those all-important Ultimate Team adjustments in the mix, FC 25 has a few tricks up its sleeve. So, without further ado, here are 71 changes that actually make a difference in EA FC 25.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2><u>Rush</u></h2><p><strong>1. Rush is a brand-new 5v5 mode that is included in all formats of FC 25, including PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions. It isn’t a standalone offering but is playable across four modes - Kick Off, Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Career Mode.</strong></p><p>2. Rush’s introduction comes at the expense of Volta, which will not be returning this year as a standalone mode but will appear in kick-off as a 3v3 match option.</p><p>3. Matches last seven minutes in total, with a further two minutes and 20 seconds of golden goal played in the scores are level. If after that things are still tied, a penalty shootout will settle it.</p><p>4. While being a five-a-side mode, Rush is actually built with four players in mind, with the goalkeeper being AI-controlled.</p><p>5. There are no fixed positions in Rush, meaning it will be up to you and your teammates to take responsibility and not just all run forward at once.</p><p><strong>6. Unlike Volta, Rush utilises the same core gameplay as standard 11v11 matches but comes with its own subset of rules:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Kick-offs have been reinvented so that each team runs towards the centre circle as the ball is launched into play. Think of it a little like the beginning of a game of Rocket League.</strong></li><li><strong>There are offsides in Rush, but only once you step inside the final third of the pitch, as opposed to the standard halfway line cutoff point.</strong></li><li><strong>There are no red cards in Rush, but instead blue cards are brandished for serious offenses, resulting in a one minute sin bin for that player. This time is reduced by 15 seconds for each opponent scored within that time frame. Two yellow cards result in a blue.</strong></li><li><strong>Penalties are completely different. Taken from the “final third line”, they’re essentially a one-on-one opportunity with the keeper – something not too dissimilar to what we see in hockey.</strong></li></ul><p>7. All Rush matches take place in the custom-built Rush Stadium, built in collaboration with Nike, and shaped like the brand’s line of Mercurial football boots. It’s futuristic in its design, and can even display environmental effects like colourful drone shows.</p><h2><u>FC IQ</u></h2><p><strong>8. FC IQ is a complete overhaul of the tactics system in EA FC and it aims to give even greater flexibility to players.</strong></p><p>9. FC 25 will launch with 31 player roles with an expectation of growing to over 50 during the course of the season. These roles are selected after you’ve placed a player in a position in your formation.</p><p>10. Three-to-five roles exist for each position. For example, a central attacking midfielder (CAM) can be picked between shadow striker, playmaker, and others. These directly affect both their offensive and defensive positioning on the pitch and the runs they’ll make off the ball.</p><p>11. The centre forward (CF) and wing-back (LWB and RWB) positions have been removed entirely from the game.</p><p>12. Wing backs can still be manufactured, however, by selecting the attacking wing-back option when choosing your left or right back’s role.</p><p>13. Through extensive Opta data research, each player has been assigned optimal roles that they will perform better when assigned. The better their familiarity with a role, the better their work rate.</p><p>14. As a result, the old attacking and defending work rate stats have been removed for FC 25. </p><p>15. Some elite players even have roles they’ve mastered, such as Vinicius Jr. cutting in from the left wing. As a result, he gets a “role plus” icon when positioned as an inside forward at LW. </p><p>16. Within each role, you can also choose the focus of that player’s movement, whether it be attacking, roaming, etc.</p><p><strong>17. FC IQ as a whole allows for more experimenting with formations, with player roles allowing for asymmetric formations to exist and for overloads of certain wings to be created. The half-wing role for central midfielders combined with both a winger and fullback is a prime example of this.</strong></p><p>18. For those not wanting to get lost too deeply in the world of FC IQ, preset tactics exist for those wishing to emulate the likes of Klopp’s gegenpress or Guardiola’s tiki-taka styles.</p><p>19. Up to five fully custom tactics can be created and switched between on the fly during matches. These can also be shared with other players online via uniquely generated cross-platform codes.</p><p>20. A new commentary system dynamically responds to tactical shifts being made during the match.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u>Gameplay</u></h2><p>21. In FC 25 Hypermotion technology now allows for authentic representation of running styles, with 1,800 players now moving as accurately as possible. In 24, the upper bodies were accurate, but now the lower bodies are too.</p><p>22. Six PlayStyles are now available for goalkeepers. These include footwork, rush out, deflector, cross claimer, far throw and far reach.</p><p><strong>23. A new professional foul button input allows you to cynically take out your opponent by dragging them down. This results in an automatic yellow card.</strong></p><p>24. Players will now not automatically find an opponent with blindly played 180-degree passes, unless their passing stats are ridiculously high.</p><p>25. Five new skills moves are available to tease your opponent with. These are the toe drag step-over, the step-over ball, the heel nutmeg, the drag turn, and the big fade.</p><p>26. More contextual animations can be seen involving goalposts and advertising hoardings, some of which look extremely painful. If the name Phil Babb means anything to you, you’ll know exactly what I mean.</p><p>27. New weather effects can affect the way you play, such as very high winds that make the ball bend a significant amount and a slippery pitch that makes your players fall over. These are available in offline play only as a matter of fairness.</p><p>28. You can now celebrate with official club mascots after scoring a goal in a number of choreographed routines. Who doesn’t want to see Heung-Min Son doing Richarlison’s El Pombo dance with Chirpy the Spurs cockerel?</p><h2><u>Ultimate Team</u></h2><p>29. In Ultimate Team, Rush is a social space that’s a break from the more competitive modes within it. You’ll bring one of your player cards into the match with them to play as and there can’t be any duplicates between you and your teammates.</p><p>30. There will be Rush squad requirements that change regularly, such as only being able to use La Liga players.</p><p>31. Completing Rush matches in FUT will earn you Rush Points, which can be used to complete objectives and earn rewards.</p><p>32. FC IQ aims to shake up the FUT meta on a regular basis. The sheer amount of options available, plus the steady introduction of new player roles, are contributing factors towards this.</p><p>33. Team of the Week cards can give players new player roles depending on how they performed in the game that earned them the card. For example, Bellingham could specialise in a playmaker role if he played a bit deeper in midfield that week.</p><p><strong>34. Speaking of cards, players can now store up to 100 untradeable duplicates for use in SBCs.</strong></p><p>35. A new upgrading system with more open requirements aims to make player evolutions more attainable, meaning you’ll be able to upgrade your favourite players more often.</p><p>36. More customisation options are also being provided for evolution cards, meaning you can change their colour, choose sound effects, and add dynamic animated effects such as fireworks.</p><p>37. Matchmaking systems between rivals and friendlies have now been decoupled, meaning that friendlies should no longer feel as competitive, and hopefully, more relaxed.</p><p><strong>38. A points-based system for weekly rewards is being added to rivals. In standard football rules, you’ll gain three points for a win and one for a draw, meaning a draw no longer feels like a complete waste of time.</strong></p><p>39. Relegations are being introduced at the top end of divisions.</p><p>40. Increased rewards distribution means that players of a higher skill level will gain even greater rewards at the top levels of rivals.</p><p>41. A new stadium has been created for Ultimate Team in FC 25 with an expanded away team section allowing you to show off in someone else’s arena a bit more obviously. </p><p>42. The amount of customisation items has been decreased, meaning that you’ll be wading through fewer menus and they’ll have a greater impact when you swap them in and out.</p><p>43. The FUT and Clubs season passes are now being combined into one overarching pass that you’ll earn progress in no matter which mode you spend more time in. You’ll no longer have to prioritise playing one mode more than the other just to earn rewards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u>Clubs</u></h2><p><strong>44. Relegation is back. In FC 25, losing enough matches will trigger a one-off relegation battle where you'll need to avoid a loss to survive the drop.</strong></p><p>45. Rush is a key component of Clubs in FC 25 as you aim to climb the Rush ranks with your team. It’s also great if you’re like me and struggle to find more than three friends to play with at any time!</p><p>46. There are also Rush player ranks to climb up individually in order to gain greater rewards. You’ll gain points by winning matches, but also through goals, assists, etc.</p><p>47. The club manager now has the power to allocate budget toward facility cards that offer unique gameplay attribute boosts.</p><p>48. Defining your club identity on the pitch with a facility budget that grows as your club reputation improves facilities, and unlocks the power of club reputation, providing a tangible benefit for building long-term success with your club.</p><p>49. Each of the 20 to 30 facility cards comes with a one-star, two-star, or three-star variant each providing a unique attribute benefit to impact all the human members of the club and not the AI.</p><p>50. The options available to the club manager add a whole new level of importance to that manager's role within the club. Do you spend your budget on a two-star shooting coach and some finishing nets to increase the finishing of all your club mates? Or maybe you opt for a three-star weight room to maximize everyone's strength.</p><p>51. A dynamic clubhouse screen, complete with your team's colours and crest, now shows you and your teammates appear in the changing room as you arrive online for your next match.</p><p>52. You’ll be able to customise your avatar in far greater detail than ever before, thanks to EA Sport Cranium, new facial sculpting tech that allows for much more variety in player models.</p><h2><u>Career Mode</u></h2><p><strong>53. Women’s teams are available to manage for the first time ever in career mode. Five major leagues are included, as well as the Women’s Champions League. Both men's and women's clubs can be managed within a single career mode save.</strong></p><p>54. Live Start Points will allow you to start a career save from a real-life point in the upcoming season. For example, taking charge of a struggling, injury-hit Chelsea at Christmas and helping them avoid the drop through the rest of the season.</p><p>55. Live Start Points can be started in 11 of the top leagues in football and also take in the state of six major cup competitions.</p><p>56. Players can now be trained to gain familiarity with certain roles brought in with FC IQ. You can teach Haaland the movement skills of a false nine, for example, if you want him to fit more naturally into Pep’s Man City system.</p><p>57. Over 90 countries have been added to scouting, meaning over 160 nations can now be looked at for the next big talent.</p><p>58. Youth players now look more like men (or boys) of their age and will grow older over time, get taller, and gain facial hair, etc.</p><p>59. You can now play matches with your youth development players, but only in the Rush mode against other youth teams. These are tournaments that happen every two months and consist of three matches each.</p><p>60. You can choose to play with these youth players at their current overall rating or their projected full potential, just to see what they might be like 10 years down the road.</p><p>61. Social media transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has made his way into the in-game social feed to announce signings made in career mode. Get ready to be absolutely sick of seeing the words “Here we go”.</p><p><strong>62. You can now start a player career save as one of a few select Icons. At launch, you can choose from Andrea Pirlo, Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Theirry Henry, and Kelly Smith. Those who pre-order will also gain access to Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, and Ronaldo (the better, Brazilian one). More Icons will be delivered to career mode throughout the season and you can play with them at any club of your choosing. Eusebio at Grimsby Town is no longer the dream it may once have been.</strong></p><p>63. There are three new ways to start a player career, thanks to origin stories. These backstories start you at different points in a player’s life and include the pressures of being the child of a legend, someone bursting onto the scene from the streets, and a player coming back from a serious injury.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u>Presentation</u></h2><p>64. There’s more action than ever on the touchline as sideline moments are cut to during the match broadcast. These can be extended celebrations, or perhaps Mikel Arteta and his subs getting annoyed at yet another act of perceived injustice.</p><p><strong>65. For the first time ever, FC 25 will offer graphics mode options that can be switched between, but both offer 60fps. </strong></p><p><strong>66. The default is Enhanced Visuals mode offers enhanced lighting, including ray tracing, and graphic details, and will upscale to 4K resolution. </strong></p><p><strong>67. Favour Resolution mode uses the standard lighting setup, but renders at native 4K.</strong></p><p>68. Time will progress throughout the course of a match. You may start a game as the sun is setting, but end it under a pitch-black sky.</p><p>69. More POV angles will be built into the broadcast this time around. These short cutscenes may play before corners, penalties, and kick-offs.</p><p>70. Sizzle montages remain before games, but now you have the option to opt in and watch a full match intro if you really want to build the atmosphere before a big game.</p><p>71. The previously mentioned EA Sports Cranium tech has allowed generic faces to mostly become a thing of the past. Now players who haven’t had an official scan put into the game still look a little like their real-life counterparts.</p><p>And those are 71 exciting things coming to EA FC 25. We’ll have plenty more about the beautiful game coming to IGN over the next few months.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy will watch football endlessly, even if it only brings him pain.

But the FIFA series is set to return with a different developer and partner, with 2K heavily rumored to have taken on the license by partnering with football’s governing body, FIFA.</p><p>In May, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed a new FIFA game was in the works, saying: “We will develop a new e-game, because (the) football simulation game is called FIFA. For hundreds of millions of children around the world, when they play (a) football simulation game, they play FIFA. It cannot be named something else.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“We are developing with new partners a new game which obviously, as everything we do, will be the best. So get ready for the new FIFA e-game.”</p><p>2K, owned by Take-Two, already makes a number of successful annualized sports games including its NBA 2K series. FIFA then, may relaunch under this banner, titled FIFA 2K.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It can only be a great thing for our players in our community.</p></div><p>During an FC 25 reveal event at EA Sports’ Vancouver headquarters, IGN asked Karthik Venkateshan, Line Producer on the Ultimate Team mode, and Richard Walz, Game Design Director on Ultimate Team, if they’d welcome the challenge of a new FIFA game coming from a major AAA publisher.</p><p>"Yes,” Venkateshan replied. “As creatives, it's always so interesting to see how other people are approaching the same problem spaces that we're approaching, how they are interpreting football, how they want to solve the same things for other players. And I don't know, it energizes me as a football fan myself."</p><p>"I agree,” Walz added. “And as a player as well, I think it can only be a great thing for our players in our community. Yeah, that's great."</p><p>IGN also spoke with Lead Gameplay Producer Sam Rivera, who echoed his colleagues comments, insisting EA Sports has not succumbed to complacency despite a lack of competition in recent years.</p><p>"We welcome competition," he said. "I think it's good for everyone to see what other football simulation engines can do. Absolutely. What I can tell you is that creating a deep simulation experience like a football simulation experience, it takes a long time. It takes many, many years of polishing, balancing. We literally every year check in thousands of changes based on community feedback and improvements that we want to make to the game. All that just doesn't appear from scratch. You need to build it over the years. So what we have done over the last 15, 20 years for us, we're very happy with our game and we'll continue."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>EA Sports has had its own way with football video games for years now, with Konami, once the market leader with its Pro Evolution Soccer series, struggling to compete with EA particularly when it comes to high-profile licenses. Konami went through its own rebrand, switching from PES to the eFootball series with disastrous results.</p><p>It would perhaps feel odd for the developers at EA Sports who worked on FIFA games for so long to be faced with having to compete with a new FIFA series from a different developer. But, as Walz suggested, competition will surely benefit the player. EA Sports is often accused of failing to justify the $70 cost of its new football video game each year, with some suggesting FC would be better off as a potentially free-to-play live service with paid expansions. Perhaps FIFA 2K25, or whatever it ends up being called, will serve not only to shake up the football video game market, but EA Sports itself.</p><p>While we wait to find out, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-25-71-changes-that-actually-make-a-difference">IGN’s hands-on FC 25 preview</a>, in which we reveal 71 changes made for this year’s game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It’s worth noting both graphical options offer 60 frames per second during gameplay to retain responsiveness.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FC 25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In a reveal event at EA Sports’ Vancouver, Canada headquarters, Fab Muoio, line producer, match experiences, outlined the benefits of these new graphics options, while confirming FC 25 will default to Enhanced Visuals.</p><p>“FC 25 will have ray traced and occlusion as part of enhanced visuals,” Muoio explained. “We'll have full cloth sim on the jersey and the shorts during gameplay, self-shadowing at all times of the day, rim lighting on the players. So what that does is the closeup shots will really punch out from the background, and give you more depth to the frame. And then we will have 3D pitch divots and puddles as well.</p><p>“Particularly with shadowing, we see the shadowing on the pitch, on the player, even in the crowd we see that impact of the shadows there.”</p><p>Muoio continued: “Looking at Favour Resolution, we have cloth sim on the shorts only during gameplay and self-shadowing is only available during the day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In another first, FC 25 will show time progression during a match. “So in the first half the sun may be setting, in the second half, it'll be nighttime,” Muoio said.</p><p>FC 25 is due out September 27, with early access through the Ultimate Edition beginning September 20, across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

This season, his first for the club, he won the Champions League, LaLiga, and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring loads of goals in the process.
