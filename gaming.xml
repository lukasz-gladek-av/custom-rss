<p>Masahiro Sakurai is one of the most well-known game developers in the industry. Best known for his work in the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, he remains a pillar of Nintendo.</p>



<p>Now, he’s discussing the changes the game development process has undergone over the years and why he’s not a fan of massive teams.</p>







<h2 id="h-masahiro-sakurai-dislikes-how-game-development-teams-continue-to-increase-in-size">Masahiro Sakurai Dislikes How Game Development Teams Continue To Increase In Size</h2>



<p>Recently, he was interviewed by Japan’s <a href="https://www.47news.jp/13701368.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">47NEWS</a> and discussed how much more satisfying it is to see the results of your work when you work solo, rather than constantly checking in with others. To him, the strength of an individual’s work runs the risk of getting lost in the shuffle when part of a larger team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Talking specifically about game development, it’s very satisfying to see the results of your hard work,” Sakurai said<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-it-can-be-really-frustrating-working-on-massive-games-with-hundreds-of-devs-there-is-work-that-clearly-shows-your-results-and-work-that-doesnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> (via GamesRadar+)</a>. “You don’t get this when working in a team, and it can be really frustrating. For example, when a pixel artist draws a picture by themselves then they of course finished it. But when managing a team, it’s often difficult because you have to keep talking about what kind of pixel art is suitable.</p>
</blockquote>







<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like this is getting more difficult with large-scale games. Staff size is rapidly increasing into the hundreds. The sense of fulfillment gained from making something by yourself is different to something made as part of a group. What you are meant to do is also changing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sakurai recently helmed the development of Kirby Air Riders, released exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Check out our coverage of the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=kirby+air+riders">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has announced plans to build a new Warhammer World in the United States with a late 2027 target for opening its doors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer World, in Nottingham, England, is the focal point for Games Workshop’s various tabletop games and a social hub for the hobby. It includes an exhibition centre with dramatic, large-scale dioramas featuring everything from famous battles in the grimdark sci-fi setting Warhammer 40,000 to the fantasy world of Age of Sigmar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For competitors, a sizeable castle-themed gaming hall lets fans play matches, often in scheduled tournaments. There’s a themed bar and restaurant, areas to paint miniatures, and an in-house store with exclusive products.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop confirmed its plans to start work on the new Warhammer World, to be built just outside Washington DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community,” Games Workshop said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original Warhammer World in Nottingham, UK sets a very high bar. We’re not going to replicate it brick-for-brick, but instead build something equally uncompromising on quality and experience, something worthy of Warhammer’s rich settings and of course the title ‘Warhammer World.’ And of course, at the heart of all this is creating something extraordinary for all of you — the Warhammer fans!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, there’s a lot to do – but with a fair wind, and the might of the Emperor and his inexhaustible armies, we hope to open the doors late in 2027.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this new Warhammer World, Games Workshop is clearly hoping to reinforce its explosive success and the ever-increasing popularity of Warhammer 40,000 in particular, which in recent years has grown far beyond the confines of a tabletop game. Its loyal fandom fusses over lore, analyzes new novels for fresh insight into the setting, and speculates about future development. The smash hit video game Space Marine 2 boosted interest in all things Warhammer 40,000 — so much so that playable character <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Titus is now the poster boy of the tabletop game and is even at the heart of its next narrative expansion</a>. And former Superman actor Henry Cavill’s upcoming Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe for Amazon will undoubtedly take it to new heights. It makes a lot of sense to have a Warhammer World in place to capitalize on the army of newcomers Cavill’s Prime Video work will surely rally together. (Cavill once visited Warhammer World in the UK and posted a video of his tour on Instagram.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Warhammer 40,000 fans are bracing themselves for an announcement and release of the 11th Edition of the game, accompanying lore developments, and new model releases. And we’re arguably in the golden age of Warhammer 40,000 video games, with Space Marine 2 still receiving updates, Space Marine 3 in the works, and Dawn of War 4 and Total War: Warhammer 40,000 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>AI is a bubble – one whose futuristic sheen deflects attention from a core of hot air. Anyone with sense recognizes this. But will it finally burst this year? Unfortunately, we have our doubts. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/"><u>Aftermath Hours</u></a>, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode by diving into the good and the bad of this brand new year. First we reflect on my time attending Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual speedrunning marathon that raises money for charity and <a href="https://aftermath.site/agdq-2026-interview-speedrun-convention-charity/"><u>just generally rules</u></a>. Gaming communities can be forces for good – at least, when they don’t allow their ranks to be overwhelmed by shitheads. Who knew? Then we move on to less positive happenings: Ubisoft just <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>shut down an entire studio mere weeks after its workers voted to unionize</u></a>. Suspicious, to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we close out the show by predicting the year ahead with 100 percent, crystal-clear accuracy. Will <em>GTA 6</em> finally come out? Yes. <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>? Absolutely not. As for the aforementioned AI bubble, well, it’s complicated (see below).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can forge a giant needle with which to personally pop the AI bubble, ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Do we think that this is the year the AI bubble bursts?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It’s hard to tell. You can say with certainty that it’s about to burst, but it’s been about to burst for a while now, and I’m skeptical that [it’s gonna happen overnight]. Your brain says it has to, and then all of this is a fiction anyway, so maybe they can continue to make it go, but it will just get shittier.</p><p>I think yes, but that presumes the shared reality that we will have lines up with how things work.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>When you think about NFTs or whatever, they required people to buy them, and nobody bought them. The metaverse required people to use it, and nobody used it. But here, it doesn’t seem to matter. In order for the bubble to burst, it has to float into a wall. What is the wall that it hits? Even if none of us have docked it at this point, does it matter? [Companies] shove it into Microsoft Office, or they put it in Google, and I don’t use it, but they can charge me more for my G Suite.</p><p>I’m definitely on Team “It has to burst, come on, this is absurd,” but what causes it? One of those big investors pulls out? It makes enough children kill themselves?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Clearly not a problem in this country.&nbsp;</p><p>I think in the meantime also we’re gonna see more and more moments like <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-larian-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate/"><u>what’s happening with Larian</u></a> where they talked about using AI to make games, people got mad at them, and it seems like they’re digging their heels in. But I think we’re gonna hear about AI usage on more major games, and people are gonna have to make up their minds about how they react – where they draw their lines in the sand. As long as executives continue to believe that they can use AI to improve efficiency, allowing them to make games faster and for less money, they’re not gonna step back from this ledge.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> One thing I will say is that the sentiment toward AI will continue to get more and more rancid. Starting the year off with what Grok has been doing and with what X has been doing, I think it is only going to get worse. I don’t know if that actually means anything materially to these companies. But with Grok doing sex crimes out in the open, there’s a nonzero chance it ends with X getting removed from the App Store in some capacity. Being on X could be a crime at this point. As people live with it more and more, it’s gonna become a meme how bad this shit is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I hope so. My concern is that people will grow numb to it. Going along with what I said a moment ago about people finding out that their favorite games are being made with AI, it also feels like a lot of those companies and a lot of the people in charge are gonna do their best to convince everyone that it’s here, it was inevitable, and now you’ve just gotta live with it. To try to win through attrition, basically – to get people to begrudgingly accept that this is just how things are now. And so maybe those rancid vibes turn into people being like “Well, what can be done, really? This is just the world now.”</p><p>So that’s my concern: that people could succumb to a state of numbness and acceptance instead of maintaining that energy of “Fuck this shit, this is bad, and I don’t want it in any of the things that I use personally.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><div><p>Please Seek Help Immediately</p><p>Motherfucker have you listened to yourself</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

              <p><span>Yesterday brought us the inaugural New Game+ Showcase, in which multiple content creators decided to cut out the Kojima-glazing middleman and just show off a crapload of games. While the event ended up getting ridiculed a lot for feeling more like a podcast than a showcase, it did include interesting new glimpses of a number of upcoming games, including what claims to to be one of the largest open-world RPGs of 2026. </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA7AZs4Gn_o"><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i></a>,<span> the sprawling action-adventure with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-pearl-abyss-horse-drift-black-desert-onl-1850763397"><span>racecar-like horses</span></a><span> from </span><i><span>Black Desert Online</span></i><span> developers Pearl Abyss, is set to launch on March 19. PR rep Will Powers was asked during </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newgameshowcase"><span>New Game+</span></a><span> about the actual size of the game world, after some of the initial previews gave the impression that the game’s pretty massive vistas were “just a tiny corner of the map.” Powers then gave an eye-popping answer:&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Twice the playable area of <em>Skyrim</em>. It’s larger than the map of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. The area that you’re playing in, the continent of Pywel is absolutely massive.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>In fairness to Pearl Abyss, that’s not a terribly out-of-pocket thing for a developer largely known for </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/black-desert-online-has-made-usd1-7bn-in-revenue-to-date"><span>an enormously popular freemium MMORPG</span></a><span> to say, especially given how much of </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> looks like an MMORPG that eventually had a single-player action game grafted into it (</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/crimson-desert-release-date-trailer-online-gameplay/"><span>which is what actually happened</span></a><span>). But still, that’s a lot of game. Or at least a lot of game map.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crimson Desert claims to have twice the playable area as Skyrim and a map larger than Red Dead Redemption 2 <a href="https://t.co/iCtLZ7IWU4">pic.twitter.com/iCtLZ7IWU4</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2009694157896663175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The footage shared thus far </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1ItNYP9U1M0"><span>in trailers and previews</span></a><span> does show a pretty world and some solid combat, and look, I will always give brownie points to any game that lets you ride a dragon. But what about the possibility that it will be a lot of space with no real purpose? Powers himself tries to cut off that concern at the pass. </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>Size doesn’t really matter if there’s nothing to do,</span><i><span>” he said “</span></i><span>Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions, so we wanted to create a world that’s not only massive but incredibly interactive</span><i><span>.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>To her credit, streamer Luality chimed in fairly often during the interview trying to press Powers on what kinds of interactions the player can look forward to in this giant world, asking if you can fight dragons or romance NPCs. The best Powers came up with in response was emphasizing </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>all sorts of deep crafting systems.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Therein lies the real issue with making promises about map size in the year of our Lord 2026: it’s long since become a useless metric. Having a game world the size of Australia is all well and good, you can even have it be full of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-game-pass-release-date-no-man-s-sky-bethesda-1849053885"><span>empty space to traverse</span></a><span>. But you have to do more with empty space than just fill it with crafting supplies. That’s a legitimate reason to praise games that actually make their terrain meaningful, like Kojima’s </span><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i><span>, and a reason to put on your skeptic glasses whenever anyone starts hyping up the size of their map rather than what’s in it. </span></p>

<p>The first Nintendo GameCube game to hit the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2026 is a pillar of one of Nintendo’s top franchises, one with a new game releasing later this year.</p>



<p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is now playable for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online as part of the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics service, which is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-takes-center-stage-in-2026">Fire Emblem Takes Center Stage in 2026</h2>



<p>Released in 2005, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is the sole game in the series released on the Nintendo GameCube. It’s also the first console game in the series to be released in the U.S. At the time, the game was received well critically. Since then, five more games have been released in the series. The game features Ike as the main character. He would go on to be a playable character in multiple Super Smash Bros. games.</p>



<p>Path of Radiance is the eighth Nintendo GameCube game to be made available on the Nintendo Switch Online service. However, unlike other releases such as F-Zero GX and Wario World, players know when the next game in the franchise will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Later this year, Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave will launch as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. That game was announced during the September 2025 Nintendo Direct. As of this writing, there is no official release date for the game.</p>







<p>For more Nintendo news, check out details on the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game. Featuring 38 characters, the game will have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/">largest roster in series history.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-ceo-stores-closing-payout-ryan-cohen-2000658532</link>
            <guid>1402162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>GameStop has been in hot water for some time now. </span><span>But the company’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, should come away relatively unscathed</span><span>, because, thanks to</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/business/gamestop-ceo-ryan-cohen-compensation-package"><span>CNN</span><span>,</span></a> <span>we now know he will score a $35 billion payout if the storefront hits a $100 billion market cap. One small issue: that’s about 10 times its current value.</span></p> <p><span>How is Cohen planning on getting it there? Thanks to a</span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/"> <i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> report</span></a><span>, we know that he intends to close hundreds of stores and to offer customers a 20 percent trade-in bonus via a QR code. Although we don’t have concrete numbers on exactly how many stores have been shut down, a</span><a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/2025/12/january-2026-reported-closings.html"> <span>post on a blog</span></a><span> that tracks GameStop closures</span><span> reports that close to 400 stores have either already been closed this month or are set to be closed before the month is over.</span></p>

 <p><span>The trade coupon, meanwhile, was shared on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/gamestop_really_put_a_trade_coupon_on_my_local/"><span>official GameStop Reddit</span></a><span> page by a user who posted their frustration about the closure of their local store, saying “GameStop really put a trade coupon on my local stores closing sign?” In that same thread, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/comment/nxhrn13/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>original poster voiced their frustrations by calling it</span></a><span> “a fucking joke,” while others stated that they have begun canceling pre-orders.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s also worth noting that GameStop closed 590 stores in 2024, according to a</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm"> <span>December 2025 SEC filing</span></a><span>. The filing goes on to state that the company plans on “closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” This is important because the 2025 fiscal year ends on January 31, 2026, which means more stores could close sooner rather than later. GameStop has also been closing stories across various countries worldwide. The same SEC Filing states that the company has already “exited” operations in Austria, Ireland, and Switzerland. In 2024, it also closed down store operations in Germany while selling off its Italian subsidiary.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Even as it shuts down stores en masse, GameStop has been doing everything it can to get attention back on the storefront over the last few months, partnering with popular influencers such as Casey Neistat and Mega64, and even with</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSIjPqvACxN/"> <span>Rilie Huntley</span></a><span>, a popular e-girl who originally went viral over a Best Buy ad. Just recently, the company had a </span><span>“</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/gamestop"><span>trade anything day</span></a><span>“</span><span> which saw people bringing in all sorts of things, including sex toys. Just a few days earlier, the</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582"> <span>GameStop card loot program led to a record-breaking $30,000 trade-in</span></a><span>.</span></p>

Here at <em>Game Informer</em>, we've been hard at work publishing stories each and every day, from previews to reviews to exclusive interviews and the daily onslaught of gaming news, to behind-the-scenes proofing and editing on the next issue of our magazine. Speaking of, it features [REDACTED] on the cover and wowsers, it's a beaut (and the story is fantastic and packed with the kind of game development details you won't find anywhere else).&nbsp;</p><p>Also, hey, this is the first This Week On GI story we've made for the site! Newsletter subscribers are familiar with our weekly round-up of stories, but fret not – this is its own thing. Now, as the Newsletter writer, I highly recommend subscribing to it because I bring a more laid-back, casual vibe to it that's not befitting of the CMS here. What I want This Week On GI to be is a post you can look forward to every Friday that not only catches you up on the latest <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping, but will also neatly organize all the stories we published this week. We know life can get busy, and you might not be able to refresh the greatest video game website ever made hourly; this article is for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, you'll find our general <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping section followed by the article round-up underneath it:&nbsp;</p><h2>Game Informer Housekeeping</h2>

<p>We've seen that many of you have already received our latest magazine issue, which features World of Warcraft: Midnight on the cover and is extra-large due to our extensive Game of the Year coverage, Editor's Top 10s, and more. If you've already received it, I hope you love and appreciate it as much as we did creating it – if you haven't yet, don't worry because it's in the mail and on the way to your mailbox.&nbsp;</p><p>We're aware of shipping hiccups that occurred in 2025 and continue to do our best to remedy any situation where someone didn't receive an issue they should have. If you missed it, the government shutdown affected postal services across the country last year, and that heavily affected our shipping processors; that's not your fault, though, and we apologize for any inconvenience or stress this may have caused you. With the World of Warcraft: Midnight issue, we're seeing that our shipping is seemingly back to normal, and people are receiving issues in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what's in the pipeline, we can't quite share what game is gracing the next edition of <em>Game Informer, </em>but trust me: you don't want to miss it. Plus, it features a massive round-up of our most anticipated games of 2026 and beyond, making it the perfect issue for those of you who like to plan out your year of gaming (like me). If you aren't already a <em>Game Informer </em>subscriber, there's still time to become one and receive this awesome issue – you can subscribe here.&nbsp;</p><h2>Story Round-Up</h2>

              <p>As PC components like RAM continue to be gobbled up by AI hyperscalers, leading to higher prices and limited supplies, a large electronics store in Japan is running out of computers and parts and is asking its customers to please sell them some old PCs.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">It has become more expensive to build or upgrade a PC</a> over the last few months. A big reason for that is <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">AI-focused tech companies gobbling up PC parts to build massive data&nbsp;centers</a>. It’s&nbsp;becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a> for your average person to buy PC RAM and graphics cards, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/after-nearly-30-years-crucial-will-stop-selling-ram-to-consumers/#:~:text=The%20fault%20lies,output%20through%202026.">as companies like Micron stop selling to consumers</a> and focus more and more on big companies that buy in bulk. Prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will likely see a price increase of 15 to 20 percent as well, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to&nbsp;<em>PC World.</em></a> All of this, plus tariffs causing other problems, has led to fewer PC parts and computers on shelves in some stores, forcing one shop to beg people to sell them some hardware.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ゲーミングPC、中古も本当に在庫なくて今これ</p> <p>あの、お願いなので買い替えたらぜひ弊社にゲーミングPCを売ってください…<br>結構高く買い取っていますので…<br>ゲーミングのデスクでもノートでも、もちろんゲーミングじゃない普通のでもPCなら大体買い取っているので… <a href="https://t.co/IinBuGgRV7">pic.twitter.com/IinBuGgRV7</a></p> <p>— ソフマップゲーミング (@sofmap_gaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/sofmap_gaming/status/2008871239096431070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 7, as spotted by <a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2076399.html"><em>PC-Watch</em></a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/pc-building/major-japanese-electronics-store-begs-customers-for-their-old-pcs-as-hardware-drought-continues-we-pretty-much-buy-any-pc-pleads-the-akihabara-outlet"><em>Tom’s Hardware,</em></a> Sofmap Gaming, a large electronics shop in the Akihabara district of Tokyo, <a href="https://x.com/sofmap_gaming/status/2008871239096431070">posted a somewhat desperate-sounding plea</a>. Here’s the tweet text via machine translation:</p>

 <p>“Um, as a favor, if you buy a new PC, please sell your gaming PC to our company. We buy them back at pretty high prices. Whether it’s a gaming desk or a laptop, or even a regular non-gaming one, we pretty much buy any PC.”</p> <p>Attached to the tweet was a photo of what appears to be a mostly empty shelf inside of Sofmap Gaming with only a few PCs and monitors left. “Gaming PCs, even used ones, are really out of stock right now. This is it,” claimed Sofmap Gaming. The account is also replying to nearly every user who responds with questions about what they can sell and how much it might be worth.</p>

 <p>With some experts saying the ongoing demand for memory and other PC components, like GPUs, will be a problem for 2026 and even 2027, it might be a good time to start looking around your house to see what random bits of hardware you have lying around somewhere collecting dust. If the parts aren’t too old, they might be worth a pretty penny soon.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-baldurs-gate-3-switch-2-port-wasnt-our-decision-to-make</link>
            <guid>1402135</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Larian Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-2-is-getting-a-free-upgrade-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-nintendo-switch-2">presented console players of Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> with a special treat: an upgraded version of the game for PS5, Xbox Series, and delightfully, Nintendo Switch 2. But while Original Sin 2 has been on Nintendo's system since 2019, Larian's next game, Baldur's Gate 3, never made it to any Nintendo console. Why not? Well, Larian at least says it wasn't its decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA today</a> conducted by various members of Larian, CEO Swen Vincke took a moment to answer a question about whether or not Baldur's Gate 3 for Nintendo Switch 2 was "even possible". Sadly, his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">answer wasn't a happy one</a>: "We would have loved to but it's wasn't our decision to make."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke is speaking in the past tense because officially, Larian is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">done with Baldur's Gate 3</a>. It's still supporting the game with minor bug fixes, but there's no reason to expect the studio to do a whole new release on a new platform now, especially since it's moved on to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">new Divinity game</a>. That leaves Wizards of the Coast in charge of the future of Baldur's Gate 3, meaning a port isn't happening without its blessing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which seems to be what Vincke is implying here - that Larian would have done one, but Wizards for whatever reason decided not to. Wizards of the Coast declined to comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a shame for Switch owners, because Baldur's Gate is a fantastic game. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">gave it a 10/10</a> at launch, saying that "with crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We covered other topics from Larian's AMA today, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-writer-wishes-wyll-had-gotten-more-content-and-a-more-fulfilling-arc-too-explains-what-happened">what happened to Wyll's storyline</a> in Baldur's Gate 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">how Larian will (or won't) use generative AI for Divinity</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-new-switch-2-joy-con-colors-light-purple-and-light-green">recently announced</a> it’s releasing a Light Purple and Light Green color variant of the Joy-Con 2 Switch 2 controllers, and now it's available for preorder.

And since black is still the main color on the casing, they’re not as flashy as the color variants of the original Switch Joy-Con. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the new colors are visible under the thumb sticks, as well as on the connector part of the controllers. The included plastic bumpers for the wrist straps are also the same colors, so they’ll be more visible when the Joy-Con 2s are disconnected from the console or grip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re buying an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 for multiplayer sessions, having different colors for each player makes it easier to tell your controller from everyone else’s. For me, if I were in the market for an extra set of Joy-Con 2, I’d definitely get these instead of a second set of red and blue ones.</p></div><div catalogid="c49cc388-129c-45cb-84e8-738834eaacdc" id="228077"><div id="228077" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario Tennis Fever</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I suspect it’s no coincidence that Nintendo’s next big first-party Switch 2 game is also coming out the same day as these new Joy-Con 2 colors. Mario Tennis Fever (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">preorder guide</a>) is also set to release February 12.

Preorder the game and a new pair of Joy-Con 2, and you’ll be all set to play with friends next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are currently only two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Joy-Con_Colors">Joy-Con 2 colors</a> on the market, I expect the list to grow in the coming years.

Australian designer Steve Dee, who was a pillar of the community thanks to his outspoken social advocacy, has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Steve Dee</h2><p>According to a social media post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/622121166/posts/10162318714106167" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Facebook</a>, the body of Steve Dee was found by his romantic partner, Hilary Kincaid, on Friday January, 2nd. The post states the cause of death was not determined, but he did not suffer. At the time of writing, an official cause of death has not been disclosed.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Steve Dee, also known as Steve Darlington, had a considerable impact on the tabletop industry. His work credits include officially licensed work like <em>Doctor Who Adventures in Time and Space</em>, <em>Vampire: The Requiem</em>, and multiple editions of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em></a> system.&nbsp;</p><p>Dee also published several board games under his own imprint, Tin Star Games. He has won several Ennies for a few of these published titles, including 2023's card-based heist game <em>The Score</em>, 2021's co-op improvised story game, <em>Partners</em>, the mystery TTRPG <em>Relics</em>, and the 2019 detective game <em>There's Been a Murder</em>.</p><p>But above all, Steve Dee was a vocal member of the community. In an in-depth post by <a href="https://www.rascal.news/steve-dee-game-designer-tin-star-games-obituary/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Rascal News</a>, many tabletop developers spoke up about Dee's passion for the medium and his active advocacy. Indie Game Developer Network's own James Kerr highlighted one of Dee's blogs on the network discussing the importance of worldbuilding. A blog so successful it became a book, titled <em>Worldbuilding for Game Designers</em>.</p><p>But Dee's biggest platform was on his personal blog, Just Do Something. This blog was an account of Dee educating himself on the atrocities happening in Gaza and discussing the use of genocide as a system of control. The ultimate goal of the blog was to encourage others to speak out and, well, do something, in light of horrible events.&nbsp;</p><p>The last post on the blog was a rough draft for a resource management and accrual game called NAKBA. A game where the goal is prevent genocide before it begins. Dee was designing the game as part of the <a href="https://www.games4palestine.it/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">games4palestine</a> initiative.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

                <p>The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.</p><p>"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact," said Roh via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be "inevitable."</p><p>The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing "This Is an Xbox" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.</p><p>The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.</p><p>A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-reportedly-combatting-gpu-shortages-by-bringing-back-discontinued-graphics-card/1100-6537185/" data-ref-id="1100-6537185">by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs</a>. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.</p><p>As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>EA's biggest franchises are undoubtedly its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/">EA Sports</a></strong> games, but on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/"><strong>EA Entertainment</strong></a> side, beyond shooters like <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-season-27-amped-arrives-next-week/">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">Battlefield 6</a>, it's <strong>The Sims</strong> that rules the roost as one of its biggest ongoing live service titles.</p>



<p>Today, EA studio <strong>Maxis,</strong> the team behind The Sims, gave players an update on the life sim franchise and its future <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims">in a blog post</a>, with insights into what players can expect in 2026 and beyond. But before it got to that, it began with a couple of paragraphs on how the "values" of the game have not changed.</p>



<p>The blog post doesn't say why it starts with this topic, but the context is clear for fans of The Sims and anyone who has paid attention to EA in the last year. Following the reveal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">EA is going private and being bought out by a 'Consortium' of investors led by the Saudi Arabia PIF (Public Investment Fund) and Jared Kushner's Silver Lake</a>, many fans of the life-sim game feared it would undergo drastic changes once the deal was finalized.</p>



<p>Changes like the removal of LGBTQIA+ representation, and changes to the game to disallow same-sex couples after The Sims was the first video game to ever feature a gay couple kissing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">While the deal has been approved by EA's shareholders,</a> it hasn't made its way through regulators, and is nowhere near finalized. So to make a statement now about how the studio's values are "<em>unchanged</em>" when the deal isn't done feels slightly muted, but it's there nonetheless. The studio even dug more into what it means by its values not changing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims">in a separate blog post to further hammer home its point</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>The Sims has always been more than a game. It’s a canvas for life in all its unpredictable forms…the chaotic moments, the tiny joys, the big dreams, every identity, every version of you. And, thanks to you, The Sims has grown into something bigger than we ever imagined: a living world bursting with creativity, expression, humor, chaos, and heart. Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future.&nbsp;The Sims will always be about life, your way.</em>"</p>



<p>Following that introduction, the post goes on to discuss what the team at Maxis is working on, confirming that the studio has multiple projects in the works, and that the team is "<em>building a family of new Sims experiences across PC, console, and mobile</em>."</p>



<p>Maxis also goes on to say that the team is "<em>committed to single-player life simulation experiences</em>," recognizing that the game's foundation has always been those moments players have when building their own worlds within The Sims.</p>



<p>As for Project Rene, the new Sims project that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/">was first introduced as a next-generation title</a>, it has now evolved into a "<em>mobile-first life-sim game</em>," and will be a separate experience from The Sims 4. Last year, Maxis and EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shutting-down-the-sims-mobile-next-year/">announced they would be shutting down The Sims Mobile in 2026</a>, and at the time, combined with a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/ea-only-plans-to-make-concentrated-bets-in-mobile-following-a-flurry-of-cancellations/">MobileGamer.Biz</a> regarding the last time EA spoke on The Sims on mobile platforms, Wccftech speculated that The Sims Mobile was being shuttered to make way for a new title. It seems that was indeed the case, though we'll have to wait until more about Project Rene is revealed to know for sure.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the studio is committed to continuing to evolve The Sims 4 after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/">confirmed that it would not be making The Sims 5</a>, and diehard fans who want to see what's coming next first will have the chance to test new features through limited market tests via The Sims Labs.</p>



<p>The blog then concluded on a final statement, all to do with the team moving into the future of The Sims with the same driving core that built its past.</p>



<p>"<em>For decades, you’ve made </em><em>The Sims</em> what it is, a world that spans generations and cultures, filled with joy, surprises, emotions, and stories that stick with us long after the save file closes. Now, we’re building the future the same way we built the past, with creativity, bold ideas, curiosity, and you as our partners. <em>The Sims</em> is, and has always been, all about you - <em>uniquely you</em>. And as a result, unmistakably <em>The Sims</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims: Project Rene is Now a ‘Social, Mobile-First Life-Sim Game’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-project-rene-now-social-mobile-game/</link>
            <guid>1402078</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sims fans have spent many a year wondering what the next major release in the series would look like. For the most part, it’s assumed that it’ll just be ‘The Sims 5’, but it’s what that game will look like that has the community deep in discussion. There’s also ‘Project Rene’, which has been thrown around by Maxis and Electronic Arts for some time.</p>



<p>At least one of those things has a more solid identity now, and it’s all thanks to those very same fans. In a new blog post, the team at Maxis revealed that Project Rene has ‘evolved’ into a ‘social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game.’</p>



<p>It’s not the next big Sims title, but what <strong>is it</strong>?</p>







<h2 id="h-project-rene-is-not-the-sims-5">Project Rene is NOT The Sims 5</h2>



<p>In a recent blog post, Maxis and Electronic Arts took a deep dive into all things The Sims. The post started with a reaffirmation that things aren’t set to run cold with The Sims 4, which will continue to receive updates and new content going forward.</p>



<p>It was believed that the game’s new expansion pack, Royalty &amp; Legacy, would be <strong>the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sims-4-royalty-and-legacy-final-expansion-pack/">final Sims 4 expansion</a></strong>. It seems that might not be the case, based on the new blog post.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> in question details everything you’d want to immediately know about Project Rene, including how the project has pivoted to focus on mobile-based multiplayer mechanics:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to ongoing player feedback, Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together. </p>



<p>It is not the successor to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>&nbsp;and is a separate experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience.&nbsp; It introduces a new way to explore and play together within the growing Sims family of games, welcoming Simmers who want to connect directly with other players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is adamant that the core of the Sims franchise is rooted – and <strong>forever will be</strong> – in <strong>single-player experiences</strong>. That has been the bread and butter of The Sims since the first game debuted almost 26 years ago.</p>



<p>And again, those updates won’t stop flowing right into The Sims 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control. That foundation isn’t going anywhere. We’ll continue to deliver content and updates to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>&nbsp;and we are committed to improving the experience.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s still no indication of when the next numbered Sims title might surface, but as the live-service, free-to-play model of The Sims 4 is doing so well, it might be a <strong>long time </strong>before it does.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘We Would Have Loved Baldur’s Gate 3 on Switch 2, But It Wasn’t Our Decision to Make’, Says Larian CEO]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/we-would-have-loved-baldurs-gate-3-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision/</link>
            <guid>1402072</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The award-winning cRPG <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong> couldn't possibly run on the original <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/modded-nintendo-switch-baldurs-gate-3-run-crysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by a test made with a modded console</a> that featured twice the amount of RAM (<strong>8GB</strong> instead of <strong>4GB</strong>), with the game still bringing this 'Switch on steroids' on its knees.</p>



<p>However, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> is a completely different beast. In some regards, it is even superior to the Xbox Series S, as Studio Wildcard's Lead Programmer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just told me in an interview</a>, and the Xbox Series S does run the game, albeit not very well. <span>Additionally, there have been successful Switch ports of computationally intensive games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</a>, to name a few, and the&nbsp;<strong>Steam Deck</strong>&nbsp;native version of BG3&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">has also made great strides</a></span>. Furthermore, last year, insider Nate the Hate had shared that he heard Baldur's Gate 3 might indeed be coming to the new Nintendo console. </p>



<p>All in all, there was good reason to believe this version would arrive at some point. However, during today's Reddit AMA, <strong>Larian CEO Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the topic</a> with a negative response:</p>



<p><em>We would have loved to, but it wasn't our decision to make.</em></p>



<p>That sounded like Vincke hinting it might be due to issues with IP holder <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>. Larian famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to pivot away from Baldur's Gate 3 DLC and a sequel</a> to make something else (which we recently learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a new <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>), and fans have long suspected that there was a fracture between the two companies, although Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-ceo-clarifies-wizards-of-the-coast-was-a-a-great-licensor-and-had-nothing-to-do-with-bg4-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly said</a> their decision had nothing to do with the company. </p>



<p>In the ResetEra thread that picked up Vincke's Reddit comment, Nate the Hate quickly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/swen-vincke-no-baldurs-gate-3-for-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision-to-make.1401871/post-149859475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>From what I was told last year… It's a complicated situation and involved their relationship with WotC.</em></p>



<p>At this point, the question is whether Wizards of the Coast might be looking for someone else to port their massively successful game. Last month, it was announced that Baldur's Gate 3 had surpassed <strong>20 million copies sold</strong>, a nearly unthinkable figure for a cRPG before Larian's game. It's hard to imagine it wouldn't sell at least a few more million units on the rapidly growing Switch 2 installed base.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Wizards of the Coast, asking for a comment, and will update this story if and when we receive it. Nintendo Switch 2 users who may be into Larian games can, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-has-launched-ps5-switch-2-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition</a> in the meantime, and the studio's Technical Director just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf8qz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in the Reddit AMA</a> that <strong>they will consider a port of the future Divinity game</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for the chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on the go on your Nintendo Switch 2 console, you’re going to want to sit down for this. It’s not happening.</p>



<p>Taking part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit on Friday, Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke was asked about the game possibly being ported to Nintendo’s latest system. His answer, immediately shut the door on it. </p>







<p><strong>“We would have loved to, but it wasn’t our decision to make,”</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vincke wrote</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-won-t-it-come-to-switch-2">Why Won’t It Come To Switch 2?</h2>



<p>As a follow up to Vincke’s confirmation, known leaker NateTheHate, who had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-could-potentially-come-to-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed in the past</a> there was a possibility to bring the game to Nintendo, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gave a bit more insight</a> into why it’s not coming.</p>



<p><strong>“While Larian would love to bring Baldur’s Gate 3 to the Switch 2… their relationship with Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast is not healthy,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Late last year, I heard [Baldur’s Gate 3] for [Switch 2] was no happening….”</strong></p>







<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 first launched in Early Access in August 2020. The full release of the game came in August 2023 on PC. The game would then come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later that year. It would also receive regular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates until April 2025</a>, when the last major patch was released.</p>



<p>While Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to Switch 2 may not be happening, that doesn’t mean Larian isn’t working on what’s next. The studio is in-development of the next game in the Divinity franchise, which, as part of the same AMA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">won’t feature any sort of generative AI</a> artwork.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And why his story still seems to be lacking.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since Baldur's Gate 3's release, Larian has put a lot of time and energy into updating the game with tons of new content, including new content for some beloved character who got the short end of the wizard staff the first time around, like Karlach. But one character is still coming up short for fans: Wyll. And at least one writer at Larian is just as frustrated by it as you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf1wn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA today</a> conducted by a number of Larian employees, during which one person asked why Wyll wasn't developed further in post-launch patches, even as other companions got storyline and even personality updates. We've known for a while that the "Blade of Frontiers" warlock Wyll was <a href="https://gamerant.com/baldurs-gate-3-wyll-early-access-story-change-karlach-explained/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewritten significantly from his early access version to final version</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question was answered by Larian senior writer Kevin VanOrd, who explained that he also wished Wyll had gotten more attention, and that the lack of content compared to other companions was mostly the result of a series of unfortunate timing coincidences. Here's how VanOrd puts it:</p><blockquote>I wish Wyll had gotten more content and a more fulfilling arc too.</blockquote><blockquote>As you probably know, we weren't connecting with Wyll's Early Access recruitment and initial questing, so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid. A lot of decisions came later in development than was ideal - and there was a key situation near Baldur's Gate that I intended to heavily involve Wyll in (the Red War College) that got cut. That meant back to the drawing board again. We eventually tied him to Duke Ravengard and started to work on that element of his arc just in time for me to get unexpectedly ill. I was out of the office for quite a while, and again after the epilogue's release.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that Ansur's lair was Swen's idea - we did have the resources for a standalone dungeon, so we got to work on tying Wyll to the Wyrmway, but I couldn't get more than a dungeon boss out of it. Once the situations were in place, that was that - I had to start writing them.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyll's content is sparser than I'd have liked as a result. He's also split into two stories, really - the Mizora story and the Ravengard story, and that might have been a mistake in hindsight. I also wish I could given him a stronger endpoint - it always bugged me that he can end up just as he started, as the Blade of Frontiers, without any meaningful difference. All that said, I love the Blade and I am really proud of him, his sincerity, his good nature, and his eager heroism. I'm truly sorry I didn't give you more quality time with him.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that it's not that Wyll received no updates post-launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-long-awaited-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-alongside-massive-patch-notes">Patch 7</a> made some light tweaks to Wyll's dialogue that helped those pursuing him romantically have a more interesting time, though it didn't really give him any new story content. But that's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">nothing compared to Karlach</a>, who got an entirely new ending in the same patch. Karlach, like Wyll, was considered to be one of the character who had been given the least love in terms of story content in the 1.0 release, and has consistently been a popular favorite. Recently, one fan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/determined-baldurs-gate-3-fan-calculates-it-has-236-hours-of-recorded-dialogue-and-even-larian-had-no-idea-it-was-that-much">broke down how many minutes of dialogue</a> every character in Baldur's Gate 3 had, and Wyll's down below most of the other companions with just under 9 hours speaking. Still, it's not as bad as Halsin, Minthara, Jaheira, and Minsc, though admittedly those four companions are a little more complex to recruit and you can't even get them until Acts 2 or 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps cold comfort to Wyll fans, but it's comforting to know that he wasn't intentionally sidelined. We're proud of him too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same AMA, CEO Swen Vincke addressed concerns about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">generative AI use on the studio's next game</a>, Divinity, following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">controversy around some of Vincke's comments</a> from an interview last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
