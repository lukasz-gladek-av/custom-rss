			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console could be getting one of the most popular MMORPGs of all time, Final Fantasy XIV, but it could only happen some time after the system launches.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EasyAllies">Easy Allies</a>, Final Fantasy XIV's producer Naoki Yoshida was asked about a possible release of the MMORPGs on the next Nintendo console. According to Yoshi-P, it's been his dream for over ten years to make sure the game could be played by as many players as possible, regardless of the platform. As such, the development team would love to have the game on a Nintendo platform, but it may take some time for this to happen. Mentioning the Xbox Series X|S version of the game, Naoki Yoshida highlighted how this version of the game happened years after they started talking with Microsoft, so we should definitely not expect Final Fantasy XIV to be available close to the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.</p>

<p>When it comes to third-party support, the next Nintendo console should see a fair amount of support in its first <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ports-issues-next-gen/">few years</a>. According to Infuse Studio's co-founder Jacob Stutton, developers won't have trouble supporting the system as they already need to take the Xbox Series S into consideration. Things, however, may change after the next-generation consoles are out, as the Nintendo Switch 2 specs will be considerably lower, and developers may have to make some sacrifices to get their games running on the system.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. More information on it should finally be coming in the next few months.</p>

<p data-characters="432" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Last month, Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors assured that the company’s restructuring efforts, which saw it shut down multiple studios and lay off roughly 27% of its staff, had ended and had “created a stronger foundation for improved profitability, cash flows and long-term value creation.” Yet as of today, Embracer has closed Pieces Interactive, the developer behind this year’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-alone-in-the-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alone in the Dark</em> remake</a>.</p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Although there’s been no announcement by Embracer itself, Pieces Interactive has confirmed its closure on <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its own website</a>. The studio was founded in 2007 and, in its 17-year history, launched over 10 games. After working with THQ on the second expansion for action RPG <em>Titan Quest</em>, it was acquired by Embracer (THQ’s parent company) in 2017. Under Embracer, it handled another <em>Titan Quest</em> expansion and then the aforementioned remake of the original <em>Alone in the Dark</em> from 1992, which launched this past March.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Embracer Group/LinkedIn.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="878" data-injectable="true">No reason has been given for Pieces Interactive’s closure, but it should be noted that the <em>Alone in the Dark</em> remake was apparently not a big hit for Embracer. There are no exact sales figures but, in <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Embracer’s report on its 2024 fiscal year</a>, it said <em>Alone in the Dark</em> “saw a positive reception from users, but a mixed reception<br>from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.” Regardless, the shut down of Pieces Interactive is another contributor to the already <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dire number of games industry layoffs</a> to have taken place this year.</p>
 <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="false">Other studios to have been closed by Embracer in the past year or so include <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-is-closing-down-volition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Saints Row</em> developer Volition</a> and Free Radical, which was in the process of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-timesplitters-4-prototype-is-a-stark-reminder-of-what-weve-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making a new <em>Timesplitters</em></a>. Others, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-reportedly-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-workers-at-eidos-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Eidos-Montréal</a>, were impacted by layoffs, while <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/take-two-is-buying-gearbox-from-embracer-next-borderlands-is-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kotor-remake-developer-saber-interactive-to-leave-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saber Interactive</a> have been sold off.

			<p>The latest version of the popular PlayStation 3 emulator, RPCS3, allows for greatly improved performance on low-end CPUs.</p>
<p>The team behind the RPCS3 project has released a new build of the PS3 emulator, version v0.0.32-16614, and the performance gains on lower-end processors are quite major. <a href="https://x.com/rpcs3/status/1802423797670109438" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to</a> the team behind the project, C++ developer Elad Ashkenazi has implemented additional SPU optimizations, offering "great" performance gains. We've included some screenshots showing framerates within Demon's Souls and Persona 5 running on a setup with a 4 cores/4 threads CPU below. As you can see in the screenshots, the performance gains are quite noticeable (101% performance gain in Demon's Souls, and 30,4% in Persona 5). We've also included two videos of Twisted Metal and Armored Core using the new RPS3 version (courtesy of 'Val').</p>

<p>Those interested can download the latest version of the PS3 PC emulator <a href="https://rpcs3.net/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The RPCS3 project kicked off back in 2011 and has since made great progress. At the moment of writing, the emulator is able to run over 2500 PS3 games (69,17%). Some months ago we covered that the emulator is able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-gt5-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run Gran Turismo 5 at 60FPS on PC</a>. Aside from ongoing work on RPCS3, the team is also working on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcsx-ps4-emulator-now-supports-audio-and-gamepads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPCSX PS4 emulator</a>.</p>
<p>We've included some info from the RPCS3 emulator's FAQ below:</p>
<div>
<p>
<h2><strong><em>Can I play multiplayer games online with real consoles or other RPCS3 users?</em></strong></h2>
</p>
<p><em>Online multiplayer is something we're thinking about and that already works on a very small amount of games with simple network code. We may not focus on it until RPCS3 is as stable and as accurate as possible. Playing games online with real PlayStation 3 systems will require the user to connect to a PlayStation Network server in many cases, thus requiring private PSN servers to be made first.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<h2><strong><em>Can I play local-multiplayer games with RPCS3?</em></strong></h2>
</p>
<p><em>Local-multiplayer is completely supported. We support up to 7 concurrent controllers at any given time, just like original PlayStation 3 hardware on both Windows and Linux. The controllers can be assigned with a wide range of configurations. For example, one player can use a keyboard while another can use a compatible gamepad. To learn more about compatible gamepads, please refer to the&nbsp;Quickstart Guide.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<h2><strong><em>Can I import my save data from my real PlayStation 3?</em></strong></h2>
</p>
<p><em>Yes, saves can be imported from a real PlayStation 3 system using the standard USB flash drive transfer method. Due to how the user account system works on a real PlayStation 3 system, in some cases, you may need to re-sign your save. For more information on how to manage your save data within RPCS3, please refer to the&nbsp;Quickstart Guide.</em></p>

            <p>
Lords of the Fallen publisher CI Games is gearing up to release a sequel in 2026.
</p>
<p>
The announcement comes from a filing from CI Games, shared by Polish site <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html">Bankier</a>, which also confirms Epic will have the exclusive worldwide distribution rights to the sequel on PC.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the rights to publish and distribute the game worldwide "on all other platforms, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S platforms for which the game is currently in development, will remain with the company".

<p>

Little else is known about the game at this point. CI Games is working on a number of projects, with the Lords of the Fallen sequel given the working title 'Project 3'.
</p>
<p>
Lords of the Fallen was a technically ambitious Soulslike that released in a rough state both on PC and consoles last year, developed by Hexworks and published by CI Games. It was developed in Epic's Unreal Engine 5.
</p>
<p>
Since then it's received plenty of updates to improve its quality, as well as various features. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update-introduces-modifiers-for-rogue-lite-challenge">most recent update added modifiers for a roguelite challenge</a>.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps, with Epic publishing the next game on PC, it will release in a more stable state to show off its engine technology.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-joins-hellblade-2-on-xbox-game-pass-this-month">Lords of the Fallen joined Xbox Game Pass last month</a>, alongside Hellblade 2.

            <p>"Two's company, three's a crowd," the saying goes, unless the first two are warriors and the third one is a priest, in which case the superior proverb is surely "three's a moderately balanced squad, two's a massive liability"? Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which "only" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>. It's another indication that this will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG</a>. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more "intimate", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&amp;A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.</p><!--more-->

<p>If you don't have time to watch an hour's worth of BioWrangling first thing on a Monday, Keywords Studios staffer and noted scuttlebutter Shinobi602 has done <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1801703748311408736">a quick Xeet round-up</a>. Some highlights: BioWare are saying that Veilguard will offer their "deepest" companion arcs yet, and that your interactions with them may go as far as angering them so much they go AWOL for a while. They're also capable of falling for each other, not just the player, which I'd welcome former Dragon Age scribe David Gaider's thoughts about in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-former-lead-writer-has-many-mostly-positive-thoughts-on-veilguards-romance-options-story-and-environments">his thread last week</a> on how difficult it is to endow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> companion characters with agency, when they're designated as player love interests.</p>
<p>BioWare are also promising/threatening the largest quantity of Dragon Age party banter ever, so much banter that you will never wish to speak to another human being again, that you will shriek and beg for silence. What's more, characters will dynamically break off and resume their bantering should they be interrupted by a rogue Pride Demon or because you've thrown yourself over a cliff to escape the relentless small talk. No more shall you miss out on the whimsical incidentals of character relationships: this banter will follow you everywhere, like a hungry dog or curse.</p>

</span></p><p>There's a lot more in the video so please accept this runner-up handful of Veilguard trivia: mages get healing spells again. There's no campaign progression block akin to Inquisition's power mechanic. Your new base of operations is called the Lighthouse. Tavern songs return. There appear to be fewer fetchquests. You can pet the griffin.</p>
<p>Anyway: thoughts on the new party size, everybody? I compared Veilguard to Mass Effect 2 in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">my first look preview</a> and this certainly chimes with that analysis. Personally I'd like the extra body, but I must admit I always felt that one member of my Inquisition party got left out of the chinwaggery, which made me anxious. So thank you BioWare, I guess, for lowering the odds that I will feel like an Xmas host trying to ensure that nobody ends up in the corner of the room pretending to check their phone.</p>

			<p>Xenogears is among the most popular JRPGs ever released on the original PlayStation, but Square Enix doesn't seem interested in releasing the game to modern platforms, leaving it to fans to remake it using modern technologies.</p>
<p>3D artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vitor3dartist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitor Maccari</a> is currently working on an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of the classic JRPG using the HD-2D style made popular by Octopath Traveler and expanded by last year's Star Ocean: The Second Story R. Using Maya, Zbrush, Houdini, Substance Painter, Megascan Textures, and SpeedTree alongside Unreal Engine 5, the artist was able to make an incredible recreation of the village of Lahan, making us hunger for a proper remake even more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenogears Remake Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBG5zhPtp2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While an official remake or remaster won't be coming anytime soon, there are still ways to experience Xenogears with improved visuals, thanks to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-xenogears-unofficial-hd-remaster-is-now-available-for-download-overhauls-ui-over-90000-textures-and-more/">unofficial HD remaster</a> that reworks the game's interface, sprites, and over 9000 textures.</p>
<p>Xenogears was originally meant to be part of a bigger series, but the project ultimately was not realized due to its creator, Tetsuya Takahashi, leaving Square Enix, SquareSoft at the time, to form Monolith, who went on to develop the Xenosaga series, which explores similar themes, and Xenoblade Chronicles franchise. The third entry in the Xenoblade Chronicles series was released in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-3-aionios-finest/">2022</a>, followed by the Future Redeemed expansion, which launched last year.</p>

<p data-characters="257" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Kar98k has been one of <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>‘s most controversial weapons, with its powerful one-shot nature drawing huge criticism from the community. Now, Sledgehammer has confirmed that it’s getting nerf, but not everyone is pleased about it. </p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">Introduced in Season 4, the Kar98k has been the subject of intense scrutiny, with plenty of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-players-are-begging-sledgehammer-to-nerf-broken-kar98k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players begging Sledgehammer to make it less powerful</a>. Finally, we now know that the Kar98k will be tweaked with the Season 4 Reloaded patch, with the developer posting a comment on Reddit to announce the move. </p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Instead of universal delight though, a group of players is voicing their unhappiness at the decision, with many claiming that the other weapons in the game and aim assist are the problem, not the sniper rifle. </p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">“Please just nerf the aim assist and make the last damage range not be a [one hit kill]—It’s still 50 meters, that’s perfectly enough for a marksman rifle,” wrote DeminoTheDragon, while l4derman agreed: “Nerf all controller assistance not individual weapons.”</p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">“Why not just buff the other guns?” asked Necessary-Travel-683. “This seems like a really poor decision, people will complain about a particular item that the masses use when they continuously get killed by said item. More people enjoy the Kar98k, the issue is the lack of other viable guns at the moment, we need more buffs not nerfs all round.”</p> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Beneficial-Yam4306 concurred, writing: “The reason the Kar98k is so dominant is that every other gun sucks! Stop getting in the way of other people’s fun time. You guys took forever to give us a good sniper, stop screwing it up!”</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">While these guys make some convincing arguments, I have to admit that I’m heavily in favor of the nerf, as I’m sick of getting no-scoped by guys running the Kar98k on small map moshpit. The weapon is simply too strong when compared to others, and while buffing everything would be nice, it’s more reasonable to tweak one weapon rather than one hundred. </p> <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="false">I for one can’t wait for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-release-date-new-game-modes-and-weapon-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 Reloaded</a> now, which is expected to release on June 26. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is "still in the process" of creating his "ideal fantasy RPG", despite the huge success of the game and the previous Souls games.
</p>
<p>
When interviewed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-miyazaki-interview-cover-story-preview/">PC Gamer</a>, Miyazaki discussed the influence of tabletop games on his work. "You might say that trying to capture that excitement of those old tabletop games and game books was one facet of making Elden Ring," he said. 

</p>
<p>
"But I think more than anything it's just my personal preference when it comes to RPGs and exploring fantasy worlds, so you might see some of my personal idiosyncrasies come into play. I'm still in the process of making my ideal fantasy RPG. While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close."

<p>

It's true the Souls games have gradually given players more choice, with the character customisation of Dark Souls developing into the open world approach of Elden Ring. 
</p>
<p>
Does that mean FromSoftware's next game could move further towards player choice, expression, and agency? Whatever it ends up being, we also know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-will-feature-poison-swamps-because-miyazaki-loves-making-them">Miyazaki's "personal idiosyncrasies" includes poisoned swamps</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's unknown what the studio's next game will be, but Miyazaki did hint in the same interview, in which he admitted "making a game as large and ambitious as Elden Ring was obviously not without its troubles".
</p>
<p>
He continued: "Every time there's things that go well and things that don't go so well. Taking those bits that didn't go so well this time with Elden Ring and incorporating those and improving those in a future title - that's something I'm really excited for."
</p>
<p>
We know for sure that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">blur the line between open field design and legacy dungeon</a>, as the team explored the open world design further.
</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Erdtree will release this week on 21st June. Are you prepared to die yet? Time is running out, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/time-is-running-out-to-prepare-for-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">here's what you need to get up to speed</a>.

</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-base-game-is-getting-new-hairdos-and-other-improvements-ahead-of-its-dlc">free update will also be added for all players</a>, including a number of new features.

            <p>This once verdant ground is now wrecked by the passage of time. My terrible nemesis looms before me, inevitable and devastating. Many have fallen to it, but I will overcome. Oh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>? I was talking about male pattern baldness. It will eventually destroy all that was once beautiful about my hairline, but at least I’ll have five fancy new hairdos to pick from when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s newest free update releases this Thursday, 20th of June. There’s also some QOL tweaks to inventory management and summoning pools, but I can’t wear those, can I?</p>

<p>As decreed by the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1801616168299499599">official Elden Ring</a> twonker account, the voluminous goblet of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> is getting a pre-release appetiser in the form of a free update patch for the base game. This will no doubt plump the code-pillows for the majestic expansion to plonk itself down comfortably on, but it’s also bringing some more substantial changes. There’s those aforementioned hairdos - five of them, in fact. There’s also some inventory tweaks. Newly obtained items will display an exclamation mark, and a new ‘recent items’ tab is getting added, presumably to soothe potential inventory bloat after the expansion pieces out its new lore revelations on to several dozen pairs of trousers, each less illuminating than the last.</p>
<p>Good news for people with mates, too. Summoning pools - to my understanding, the groups of summonable allies in each region - can now be enabled or disabled individually through a new Map Functions menu. Active summoning pools will now be carried over to new game plus, too.</p>
<p>As you may have surmised, it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> frenzy at the treehouse this week. You can barely move without someone whispering cryptic prognostications at you. Just this morning, I asked Ollie how to get the new coffee maker working, and he told me to seek the ‘three unclosing eyes of the eyeless one’. Took me twenty minutes to work out he was talking about the plug socket, by which time he’d disappeared in a fit of manic laughter. A slippery one for sure, although you could do worse than booking up on his complete guide to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-lore-story-explained">Elden Ring’s lore and story</a>. He writes as smooth as Vaati narrates, say I.</p>

			<p>Following the massive success of the Fallout TV show and subsequent resurgence in sales of previous installments, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Microsoft was interested in fast-tracking the next mainline single player game. Even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer subtly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at that possibility in a recent interview.</p>
<p>However, in a lengthy video chat with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrMattyPlays</a>, Bethesda's Todd Howard clarified there's no interest from the studio in rushing out a new Fallout game.</p>
<p><em>I agree with the statement that Fallout has never been more popular, looking at the number of players coming into those games and obviously the popularity of the TV show. We give a lot of thought to franchise management. I spend a lot of time thinking about franchises I love and what I've seen out there in terms of content. For us, it's sort of game planning out, number one, making sure Fallout is relevant in the world. I think, well, clearly it is, and people are hungry for even more.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We've never stopped doing Fallout work. A lot of that work goes on obviously in Fallout 76. We have just had the Skyland Valley update, so we're really, really excited with where that game is at. We feel really fortunate and the team, I'm so proud of the work that's been done there.</em></p>
<p><em>For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can't talk about those right now, but I would say rushing through them, or we need to get stuff out that is different than the work we're doing in 76... We don't feel like we need to rush any of that. Right now, the Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling. I totally get the desire for a new mainline single player. Look, these things take time. I don't think it's bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we're doing in a franchise, whether it's Elder Scrolls or Fallout or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loves these franchises as much as we do.</em></p>
<p>Todd Howard also shared that Bethesda Game Studios titles registered 25 million players last month, a new record for the developer.</p>
<p><em>Our games have never been more popular. Last month we had 25 million players in our games. It's just a staggering amount of people and players that we hear from where our number one job always is: how are we serving that audience on a month-to-month basis so we're taking care of them while also developing new products.</em></p>
<p>He also talked about the future of Starfield, chiefly its first annual expansion; you can read more about that <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/kaiju-no-8-fans-are-dreading-its-first-video-game-will-be-yet-another-cashgrab-gacha-title/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=kaiju-no-8-fans-are-dreading-its-first-video-game-will-be-yet-another-cashgrab-gacha-title<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="327" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Over the weekend, it was announced that hit anime <em>Kaiju No. 8</em> would be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kaiju-no-8-stomps-over-to-mobile-and-pc-for-first-game-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting its own video game tie-in</a>. While this is no doubt something fans have wanted for a while, some of the initial hype seems to have quickly died down given the game will be free-to-play, sparking assumptions that it will be another typical gacha game.</p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">Granted, the announcement trailer nor <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000161.000097851.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a> give any hint as to what the actual gameplay will be like. However, developer Akatsuki Games is responsible for several other gacha games, like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-look-into-the-popularity-of-dragon-ball-z-dokkan-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle</a></em> and <em>Atelier Resleriana</em>, so it’s not unreasonable to assume <em>Kaiju No. 8</em> <em>THE GAME</em> will follow suit. As such, some of the responses from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaijuNo8/comments/1dgj7y7/kaiju_no_8_the_game_official_trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fans on Reddit</a> haven’t been the most positive.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="『怪獣８号 THE GAME』第１弾トレーラー／『Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME』OFFICIAL TRAILER 1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kJ7mXzFbGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="744" data-current-count="1044" data-injectable="true">“It’s 100% a gacha game. It might very well be a high effort one, but it’s still a casino,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaijuNo8/comments/1dgj7y7/comment/l8qdmo1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">warns one fan</a>. Several Reddit users in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1dgk1xn/kaiju_no_8_the_game_first_teaser_will_be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this thread</a> are already describing it as a “cashgrab,” arguing that the manga/anime lacks a large enough cast of characters to build a gacha game around. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1dgk1xn/comment/l8qlfao/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One user</a> says, “They haven’t develop any other antagonist or characters, so unless they take a page from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/solo-leveling-arise-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo Leveling</a></em> and create A LOT of new characters and kaijus… they’ll have to stall content.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1dgk1xn/comment/l8qfpws/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Another concurs, adding</a>, “The manga has about a few hours of story AT BEST and honestly is so underdeveloped that I cant even see they [sic] branching out to side plots and it making much sense.”</p>
 <p data-characters="603" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say there’s zero interest in <em>Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME</em>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaijuNo8/comments/1dgj7y7/comment/l8rlfwq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One fan</a> is hopeful that even if it is a gacha game, it’ll play akin to something like <em>Genshin Impact</em> or <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, saying, “I’d be more accepting of gacha if there’s actual gameplay involved.” For a game all about giant kaijus, real-time action would be more preferential than static turn-based battles. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaijuNo8/comments/1dgj7y7/comment/l8qbg8k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Plenty</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaijuNo8/comments/1dgj7y7/comment/l8qbpdv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaijuNo8/comments/1dgj7y7/comment/l8qfqnr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">others</a> are also impressed with the visuals shown in the trailer. At the very least, it’ll certainly be a pretty game to look at and could boast some top-tier animation.</p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="false">It would ultimately make sense for the <em>Kaiju No. 8</em> game to follow the gacha trend considering how profitable free-to-play gacha games can be. Despite some early hostility, I imagine die-hard fans will flock to the game regardless to at least try it out, though what will be interesting to see is whether Akatsuki Games can maintain a dedicated enough player-base and consistently make enough money to keep the game running.</p>

            <p>Beloved friends, hated enemies - last week, we let the side down. Due to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alice-b-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye">shortage of hands at the pump</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">persistent clouds of Geoff Keighley activity</a>, there was no weekly Maw liveblog, and this has bred disaster. Shaken, stirred and finally ignited for want of two-sentence updates about Dragon Age, the Maw emitted a full 13% of its cosmo-puissance into Mundus and took a grievous bite out of the ailing and fearful lasagne of reality itself. Hated friends, beloved enemies - I am very sad to say that the proud nation of Dimplexland is no more.<!--more-->
</p><p>Never heard of Dimplexland? Ah, but this is what happens when the Maw escapes containment and gets its infinitesimal, polychromatic fangs into something other than a news story about video games. Whatever the creature devours is stripped from the empirical realm and becomes the merest fantasy, be it a person or an entire country with 15 ethnic groups, a prosperous silver mining industry, and a royal family that traces its history back to the early 1200s. Why, I could almost have made Dimplexland up while writing this post, based on the logo of the radiator behind my desk! Pray for Dimplexland. You shall be avenged, just as soon as I've had my coffee.</p>
<p>Let us strike the drum and proceed to this week's most ravishing new PC games releases with an air of appropriate solemnity and despair. Actually, let's not do that, because it's a pretty attractive haul this week. On Monday 17th June we've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/el-dorado-the-golden-city-builder">El Dorado: The Golden City Builder</a>, one of Alice B's (RPS in peace) ones-to-watch, whose name very much sums it up. On Tuesday 18th June, we've got The Chinese Room's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a>, a game about Scottish oilmen dealing with an undersea threat in the 1970s, together with the early access launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pax-dei">Pax Dei</a>, which Matt Cox describes as "an attempt to pull off EVE Online in medieval Europe", and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668290/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun__Forges_Of_Corruption_Expansion/">Forges Of Corruption</a> expansion for cherished Space Marine shooter Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. Wednesday 19th June brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2574460/Scars_of_Mars/">Scars Of Mars</a>, a first-person real-time RPG which looks like Ultima Underworld put through the teleporter with Cosmic Encounters, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/murky-divers">Murky Divers</a>, which looks like Lethal Company but underwater. On Thursday 20th June, there's a regular meteor strike in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>. Assuming there's any games industry left after Erdtree makes landfall, we'll be simmering down on Friday 21st June with offworld newspaper intern sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/883230/Times_and_Galaxy/">Times And Galaxy</a> and cyberpunk citybuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dystopika">Dystopika</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, it's possible these are not in fact this week's most important new PC game releases. It's possible I am abysmal at this job, and there are a bunch of other games that deserve your attention. Go on, there's the comments thread. PC game news aside, there will be a two minute silence in memory of Dimplexland at 2pm today. If you're participating, please wear the official Dimplexland colours and use the hashtag #Dimplextinguished.</p>

    <p>Some more Dragon Age: The Veilguard intelligence, care of a Discord Q&amp;A with BioWare which I believe some of you sat in on.

    Elden Ring is getting a free update ahead of Shadow Of The Erdtree's release on the 20th or 21st, depending on where you're based. It adds some new QOL features, like a exclamation mark to highlight recently acquired items. Also, five new hairdos. I have to wonder if the number was decided on first, or FromSoft were inspired to create exactly five before the well of inspiration ran dry. Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-base-game-is-getting-new-hairdos-and-other-improvements-ahead-of-its-dlc">Eurogamer</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monolith%E2%80%99s-wonder-woman-receives-first-details-alongside-concept-art.903090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monoliths-wonder-woman-details-art/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Details about Monolith Productions' <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-monolith-troubled-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woma</a>n game have surfaced alongside concept art.</p>
<p>The art and first details of the game 'leaked' through an online marketing survey, which was picked up by various outlets (including <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/first-details-and-concept-art-leaked-for-monoliths-wonder-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSOGaming</a>). Initially, screenshots of the survey were <a href="https://imgur.com/a/o4Ma5iZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on IMGUR</a>, but these have since been removed. Luckily, the shots also <a href="https://x.com/ArkhamVideos/status/1802396185086312706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made their way to X</a>. Looking at the information provided in the survey, we're looking at a Shadow of War-like title, complete with the series' iconic Nemesis system, and fast-paced combat. From the looks of it, we're looking at an open-world setting, set in Themyscira. Aside from iconic DC characters, Wonder Woman will also introduce unique procedurally generated enemies and allies.</p>
<p>We've included the description as included in the market survey below:</p>
<p><em>"The powerful sorceress Circe has invaded your island homeland of Themyscira, leading an army of cyclopes, gorgons, and other monsters"</em>, the survey reads. <em>It is up to you, as Champion of the Amazons, to return home and fight their treachery".</em></p>
<p>As for the game's combat, setting, gameplay and characters:</p>
<p><em>"Use your godlike strength to deal shattering blows and tear through enemies in an epic battle to protect your birthplace from the invaders. Engage in fast-paced free-flow combat with devastating combos and wield powerful weapons gifted by gods, including the iconic Lasso of Truth.</em></p>
<p><em>As this original Wonder Woman story unfolds, you must also repair your relationship with your mother, Queen Hippolyta, and your fellow Amazons who feel betrayed by your decision to leave Themyscira many years ago.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the course of the game, you will encounter iconic DC-characters as well as a unique cast of procedurally generated allies and enemies. Through the power of the Nemesis system, they will remember your choices and actions, and react according to their own beliefs.</em></p>
<p><em>Fly across the open world of Themyscira as you explore the home of the Amazons and discover mythical inhabitants and Greek mythology. Fight back against the invaders and complete your quest to stop Circe from destroying your home and acquiring untold power!"</em></p>
<p>Quite the description that reveals some interesting new details about the title. So far, Warner Bros. and Monolith haven't provided that much information about the game. Late last year, Warner Bros. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-is-a-single-player-game-not-designed-for-live-service-says-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did say that the game would be a single-player title</a>, not designed for live service.</p>

        <p>Co-developer to specialise in Unreal Engine and operate remotely out of the UK</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Games industry veterans Rik Alexander, Myke Parrott and Ryan Woodland have announced the launch of their co-development studio, CodeDev - The Unreal Guys.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the developer specialises in Unreal Engine, and will operate as a remote studio based in London, UK.</p>
<p>Parrott, the founder of games recruitment company Game Logic, will act as CEO. Alexander, previously CEO at The Multiplayer Guys and founder of Super Punk Games, will be chairman. Last but not least, Woodland will be The Unreal Guys' CTO, having previously worked at the likes of Nintendo and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Alexander explained that the launch of the studio was motivated by seeing developers "of all sizes" increasingly choosing a co-development model.</p>
<p>"I've worked with Myke and his recruitment agency for a long time, but with the way the industry is changing we felt like this was the right time to work closer together and create a studio that can build, scale, and deliver expert teams quickly," he added.</p>
<p>Parrott continued: "Working in recruitment I’ve been very sensitive to changes in the job market. Rik and I felt that although we're not out of the woods yet, there's some light poking through the trees for the games industry, which is why this is the right time to unveil The Unreal Guys."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Polish publisher and developer CI Games has announced Lords of the Fallen 2 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The sequel to 2023's Lords of the Fallen <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was confirmed</a> as part of a release via Polish financial media outlet Bankier. According to the release, the sequel (for now dubbed Lords of the Fallen 2) will be fully exclusive on PC via the Epic Games Store "throughout" the game's lifecycle. As such, Lords of the Fallen won't be a timed EGS-exclusive on PC.</p>
<p>As for the release on consoles, the release reads: "Rights to the Game and the series, including all copyrights (IP), including the rights to publish and global distribution of the Game on all other platforms, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, for which the Game is currently being developed, will remain with the Company".</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen is currently planned for a release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026. More information about the sequel will be shared in the near future.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> the 2022 reboot of Lords of the Fallen upon release, and while impressive visually and story-wise, the game fell short on combat, performance, and overall polish. Back in January of this year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-sales-have-surpassed-1-2-million-units-ci-games-working-on-multiple-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that more than 1.2 million copies of the title were sold</a>. Here's a short part of our review from 2022:</p>
<p><em>Lords of the Fallen showed a lot of promise before release, and I was disappointed to see how the game failed to deliver an enjoyable experience. Some die-hard Souls series fans may find some enjoyment in the 35 or so hours-long journey to save Mournstead, but everyone else likely won't be able to see past the game's many shortcomings. Combat is the heart and the (dark) soul of any soulslike, and an interesting story and solid world design can only do so little to alleviate issues stemming from clunky combat design.</em></p>

        <p>Sales of recent title Wizard with a Gun not "strong enough to sustain studio"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Seattle-based developer Galvanic Games has shut down.</p>
<p>Galvanic Games president and founder Patrick Morgan announced the closure on <a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1801685792416498112">social media</a>, noting that sales from its latest project Wizard with a Gun weren't "strong enough to sustain the studio."</p>
<p>"The last year has been particularly tough for games," Morgan wrote. "While we had numerous encouraging conversations at DICE and GDC, the process of signing new projects, even in a good year, takes longer than the runway we had left."</p>
<p>He continued: "I may never get over the irony of spending a decade building my ideal team, only for it to end after our most productive year. The dedication, creativity, and hard work of every person on our team have been nothing short of extraordinary."</p>
<p>Galvanic Games was founded in 2015, debuting its first game Gurgamoth in 2016 followed by The Rust Belt, Rapture Rejects, and Some Distant Memory.</p>
<p>It partnered with Devolver Digital for the release of Wizard with a Gun in 2023.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wont-feature-a-story-mode-reveals-arrowheads-new-ceo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-won%E2%80%99t-feature-a-%E2%80%9Cstory-mode%E2%80%9D-reveals-arrowhead%E2%80%99s-new-ceo.903069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wont-feature-a-story-mode-reveals-arrowheads-new-ceo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It looks like Helldivers 2 won't be getting a separate story mode, which is a bummer for the franchise's fans, given the massive hype it has managed to gain.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be surprising to say that Helldivers 2 is indeed one of the most trending games of this year, with the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling over 12 million units</a>, according to publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment. One Twitter/X user asked Arrowhead's new CEO, Shams Jorjani, whether Helldivers 2 would ever feature a "dedicated story mode", to which he <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1801312333379084727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replied</a> that it wouldn't happen, saying that it would be equivalent to building a new game.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not happening. Sorry bro. That's like building an entirely new game.</p>
<p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1801312333379084727?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Well, the CEO's response isn't unexpected at all, given the complications involved in building a story narrative from scratch. And given that Helldivers 2 has done a great job in being the "live-service" title as intended, squeezing in a story mode simply won't be the right move, even if the fans desire it. Apart from that, Arrowhead's CEO also stated that the team is going on a "summer break," which will slightly impact the game's development pace, but there's nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>In other Helldivers 2 news, the title managed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-helldivers-2-npd-circana-april-2024/">maintain its position in Circana's North American sales data</a> for April, which shows that the game is still popular amongst many consumers. The future for the franchise is exciting, and we can't wait to see what developments will contribute to its longevity, given that Arrowhead aims to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-wants-to-become-the-next-fromsoftware-or-blizzard/">next "FromSoftware and Blizzard."</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/house-of-the-dragon-season-2%E2%80%99s-premiere-lets-side-characters-take-the-spotlight-in-a-way-the-book-never-could.903030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ybfAFG"><em>House of the Dragon</em> has always been about how the smallest decisions can have unforeseen consequences, but rarely has that theme been as clear as it was in the season 2 premiere. In the show’s first episode back from break, Daemon Targaryen decides to take matters into his own hands with a plot that probably could have used a little more planning (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23380813/house-dragon-daemon-matt-smith-wedding-bad-guy">classic Daemon</a>). But while the book’s version of these events is fittingly brutal, the show’s approach is quieter, more human, and arguably a little more horrifying. </p>
<p id="EF2kKV">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 episode 1.]</p>
<p id="Uxr3TR">In the book version of the story, the assassins at the center of this episode’s action are named Blood and Cheese. And while they don’t get these silly names in the show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23404846/house-dragon-alicent-larys-feet-oh-no">they do get a level of horror and humanity</a> that the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23292279/house-of-the-dragon-mushroom-canon">book doesn’t have time to afford them</a>. The book versions are boogeymen, terrifying lowlifes who kill a handmaiden and a handful of guards, and seem gleefully cruel in the way they slay Prince Jaehaerys — tricking Queen Helaena into first naming her younger son for death before killing her firstborn instead. </p>

<p id="mvsODa">And while those versions of the characters are significantly more stomach-churning, the show’s approach feels much more appropriate thematically. Rather than the murderous wraiths of the book, who slip into the queen mother’s chambers, leaving a pile of bodies behind them, <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s assassins simply move through the castle unnoticed, a pair of hired hands of low status and low intelligence, functionally invisible to the royalty who own the halls. When they reach difficult junctures in the castle’s tunnels, or difficult choices, they panic and bicker and bumble. The Blood and Cheese of the show aren’t gifted killers, they’re just amoral men sent to do something too disgusting for anyone to have imagined possible. </p>
<p id="REsk9J">Adding to all of this is the sense of desperation that the pair’s meeting with Daemon seems to have instilled in them. According to showrunner Ryan Condal, the team wanted the set-piece to play out like a “heist gone wrong,” and as the scene stretches on, we can feel their worry set in, making them more reckless, cruel, and hurried in the process. While the show cleverly leaves Daemon’s final words a mystery, the pair’s fear over what Daemon will do to them if they fail is palpable.</p>
<p id="U7mmlp">“We know who Daemon is; I don’t think he necessarily directly ordered the death of a child,” Condal said in a roundtable. “But he clearly said, <em>If it’s not Aemond, don’t leave the castle empty-handed</em>.”</p>
<p id="wxXWsd">So when they can’t find their initial target, it makes sense that these two decide to settle for the first royal son they can find. It’s the kind of hurried decision that only these two brutes could make. And, in a scene that’s both grotesque and funny, the two assassins realize that they can’t even tell the two children asleep in their beds apart, and have to riddle their way through Helaena’s answer. The whole thing is a ridiculous farce from two people barely competent enough to pull any of this off. </p>

</p>
<p id="Jmpnea">All of this builds into the show’s fantastic slippery slope of assumptions. While the audience may know that Aemond’s slaying of Lucerys Velaryon in the skies over Storm’s End was an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">accidental consequence of not understanding his own dragon’s power</a>, for Daemon, it seems like an act of clear and predetermined aggression. He probably didn’t expect the assassins to come away with the head of a toddler prince, but he thinks letting two assassins loose in the Red Keep with less-than-clear orders is nothing more than a slight escalation.</p>
<p id="2U9X3S">These are the kind of spiraling, misinformed decisions that <em>House of the Dragon</em> builds its beautiful, flawed, and deeply human history out of. Sure, the show is elevated to the heights of fantasy, but it’s still fundamentally a story of broken, furious, and faulty characters making rash decisions and then dealing with the consequences — those consequences just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23631284/house-dragon-season-2-plot-game-of-thrones-teaser-winds-of-winter">often happen to involve dragons and war</a>. </p>
<p id="7mb6j3">All of this is true to Martin’s vision, of course. It’s the same kind of storytelling he employs constantly in A Song of Ice and Fire, but while the original <em>Game of Thrones</em> series frequently had to cut down on the humanness of its story simply by virtue of its massive scale, it’s constantly thrilling to see how effectively <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em> goes the opposite direction</a>, expanding on Martin’s written history in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> and turning these quasi-mythical historical figures into flesh-and-blood people and incredible characters, up to and including the lowlife assassins who don’t even need their silly little names. </p>

  <p id="T31SS8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419614/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> season 1 saw a lot of politicking. As factions and animosity grew in equal measure, the Targaryen family spent a lot more time fighting and yelling in the rooms of King’s Landing than they did riding dragons. But by the final episode, the dragons — and their use in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">coming Dance of the Dragons</a> — take center stage. </p>
<p id="LhuYVo">And season 2 is picking right up where the last season left off, with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23368925/house-of-the-dragon-kids-who-rhaenyra-alicent-daemon-jace-joffrey-aegon">House Targaryen</a> civil war on its way. Now, more than ever, how many dragons are on each side and who their riders are really <em>matters</em>. As we see in episode 10, even with the proper rider, dragon warfare can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419108/house-dragon-aemond-lucerys-vhagar-battle">lead to calamitous consequences</a>. Season 2’s premiere sees Alicent trying to make this clear to Aegon — but, this is the Dance of Dragons, after all; there’s bound to be a bit of talon on talon. </p>
<p id="aewTaz">Especially since, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419263/house-dragon-daemon-singing-vermithor">Daemon (Matt Smith) noted</a> in the season 1 finale: Not all the dragons in Westeros are accounted for; there are “neutral” dragons, which are dragons that (for one reason or another) have no rider. In a war where dragons — and their varying strength, might, and size — impact who controls which part of the map, any dragons up for grabs are likely to be important. </p>
<p id="bwXhyL">So with season 2’s war underway, it’s worth taking a second to account for each of the dragons that <em>House of the Dragon</em> has set up so far, whose side they’re on, and who their rider is.</p>

<p id="CaTYBV">Riders: Laena (deceased), Aemond Targaryen</p>
<p id="IUzLFy">The oldest and biggest of the Targaryen dragons in Westeros, and the only living remnant of Aegon’s conquest, Vhagar was once ridden by Visenya Targaryen when she, her brother, and her sister united the seven kingdoms. Vhagar then passed to Baelon Targaryen, before being claimed by her most recent (previous to episode 7) rider, Laena Velaryon. After Laena’s death, the dragon remained riderless for only a short time before being claimed by Aemond Targaryen, whose dragon egg baby gift did not hatch. Despite Vhagar’s age, she remains one of the most fearsome and dangerous dragons in Westeros, and is now ridden by one of the Greens’ most ardent supporters. </p>
<p id="aGr15w">Vhagar and Aemond were directly responsible for Lucerys’ death at the end of season 1. Now, Aegon is eager to use Vhagar to blast his way through this civil war. Alicent (et al.) are not so stoked on that plan, and would actually prefer Vhagar be left in King’s Landing as much as possible for defense. </p>
<h2 id="xb1vSU"><strong>Sunfyre </strong></h2>
<p id="LYWQEJ">Rider: Aegon Targaryen</p>
<p id="ZdXcxv">A bright-gold dragon with pink-membraned wings, Sunfyre is the dragon of Aegon Targaryen and a swift flier, though far from the biggest of the Targaryens’ remaining dragons. Nonetheless, Aegon feels good about a Sunfyre and Vhagar team-up being enough to bring houses that haven’t declared for them to heel. </p>
<h2 id="xTSKTR"><strong>Dreamfyre</strong></h2>
<p id="bnKvTK">Rider: Helaena Targaryen</p>
<p id="tQxZgm">Dreamfyre is a pale-blue dragon, older but more slender than most of the others. She is claimed by Helaena Targaryen.</p>

<p id="Tyo3au">Rider: Daemon Targaryen</p>
<p id="ruhCZr">Caraxes is one of the largest and most dangerous of all the remaining Targaryen dragons, thanks in part to the fact that it’s seen war most recently. Caraxes has red scales and was ridden by Daemon Targaryen during the Prince’s many battles around the world, most notably in the Stepstones.</p>

<p id="imVqTv">Meleys is known as the Red Queen thanks to her red scales and pink wing membrane. Meleys is now an old dragon, but in her younger days she was perhaps the swiftest and most nimble of all the Westerosi dragons. Despite her age, however, she remains fearsome in battle.  </p>
<p id="V1UIHw">In the opening of season 2, Rhaenys and Meleys have been patrolling over “a hundred miles of open sea” to hold the Sea Snake’s blockade. </p>

<p id="RgQXPW"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419263/house-dragon-daemon-singing-vermithor">Vermithor is one of the oldest living dragons</a> in Westeros and resides in the Dragonmont on Dragonstone. Despite his old age and massive size, we don’t know much about the riders that Vermithor has previously had, with the one exception of King Jaehaerys Targaryen, who rode the dragon until his death. Vermithor is one of the largest dragons to ever reside in Westeros with only Vhagar and Balerion besting him in size. </p>

<p id="qDeZnS">Silverwing was once bonded with Queen Alysanne Targaryen, the wife of King Jaehaerys. Seemingly mirroring the couple’s love, Silverwing and Vermithor often coiled together in the same lair inside the Dragonmont on Dragonstone. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-with-an-impressive-first-2-hours</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-%E2%80%93-hands-on-with-an-impressive-first-2-hours.903006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-with-an-impressive-first-2-hours<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The list of impressive looking soulslike games on the horizon is long, with games like Phantom Blade Zero, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, and Wuchong: Fallen Feathers all having solid showings this summer event season. But there’s always been something extra special about Black Myth: Wukong. It’s stunningly gorgeous, the animations are incredibly fluid, it’s steeped in rich Chinese culture, and there’s just something immensely satisfying about playing as a Monkey King and beating up all sorts of mythical creatures with a giant extendable staff. While this isn’t the first time IGN has gone hands-on with the game, it is my own personal first time with it – and after two hours of playtime with the opening chapter, I somehow walked away even more excited for its August 20th release. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>IGN China has already done an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-the-first-hands-on-preview"><u>extensive preview</u></a> on what Wukong plays like on a late game build with many techniques, stances, and transformations already unlocked, which is great because my two hours covered pretty much the very start of the game. The first thing that I noticed as I started playing was how fluid and fast Wukong feels to control. Many soulslikes are built on a foundation of  slower and more methodical combat, but Wukong feels exceptionally quick and agile. From the beginning, there’s actually no block button. Wukong can twirl his staff to block projectiles, but as far as melee attacks go, everything must be dodged. To that end, there’s a Bayonetta-style dodge system where you can dodge up to three times very quickly, but after the third one, you’re punished with a lengthy recovery time to try and curb people from just mindlessly mashing the dodge button. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wukong feels exceptionally quick and agile.</p></div><p>Perfectly timed dodges will reward you with extra focus, and once your focus bar has been filled, you get a focus point that allows you to chain a strong attack into your light combo string for a big chunk of damage. Later on, those focus points can also be spent on different types of special moves that you unlock in the skill tree, which we’ll get to later. </p><p>Wukong also has access to a number of spells that consume his mana. I only really got to play around with the immobilize spell, which as you can imagine, stops an enemy in their tracks and allows you to sneak in a few free hits before the spell’s effect wears off. Stronger enemies and especially bosses are affected by the spell much less, and sometimes they were able to shrug it off entirely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even at just an early stage, combat was a fun dance of actively looking for opportunities to avoid enemy attacks and find openings to attack, keeping an eye on my focus meter so I could use a damaging heavy attack whenever I had a chance, while also managing my mana and cooldown for my immobilize spell. Eventually I got my first transformation, which turns Wukong into an absolute beast, with much stronger attacks, and a hugely damaging super attack that he can use out of a dodge if he manages to build up a focus point. One of his moves in this transformation is a lightning fast dash attack that made me feel like I had basically turned into the boss that I got the transformation from. </p><p>Later on I added another tool to my repertoire: the tower stance, which swapped out my chargeable overhead strong attack for the ability to stand on my staff and avoid damage on the ground as long as my stamina held out. If I managed to stay on the staff long enough for a focus point to charge, I could spend it to leap off the staff, flip it around, and come crashing down with a powerful strike that felt incredibly cool to pull off. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These stances, along with my general combat abilities, could all be upgraded through a level-up system that works a lot like Sekiro’s. As you defeat enemies, you’ll gain Will, which builds up a bar in the top right of the screen. When the bar is full, you gain a Spark, which can be used to purchase upgrades from one of your various skill trees. Once you fill the bar and bank a point, you can’t lose it. You can even add that skill point whenever you want, not just at a shrine, which serves as Wukong’s version of a bonfire-like checkpoint. However, if you die before you manage to fill the bar, a portion of that experience will be lost in typical soulslike fashion. </p><p>Don’t let that trick you into thinking that Wukong is an easy game though, because it certainly is not. Enemies are aggressive, bosses are relentless and even more so in their second phases, and you only have a scant few restorative potions to keep yourself alive. I also managed to find a secret boss room behind a waterfall that took me to a dragon boss that just absolutely wrecked me. Fortunately, you can teleport from shrine to shrine, so you can come back to him much later down the road once you’ve upgraded your gear and added some more points into your skill trees. And speaking of gear, I didn’t manage to find all that much, but I did find enough to at least know that there are sets of armor that grant extra bonuses for wearing multiple pieces of gear from that set. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemies are aggressive, bosses are relentless, and you only have a scant few restorative potions to keep you alive.</p></div><p>The levels themselves were fairly linear with a couple of branching points that led to some sort of treasure or item pickup. The real star of the show, though, were the boss battles. Even in just two hours I fought against a wide variety of bosses, from a speedy wolf boss that I snagged my first transformation from, to a mule-kicking frog in human clothes, to an extremely difficult two-phased battle against a snake man. </p><p>All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time with Black Myth: Wukong. Even in just two hours of playtime, I felt like I got to experience a lot of combat progression and am excited to see how things continue to evolve as the game goes on. We won’t have to wait much longer to see how the full game shakes out, as Black Myth: Wukong releases on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/team-tremor-disqualified-from-dbdleague-after-refusing-to-rejoin-match-after-a-known-bug/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=team-tremor-disqualified-from-dbdleague-after-refusing-to-rejoin-match-after-a-known-bug<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="228" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">DBDLegue has confirmed that Team Tremor has been disqualified from Season 9 for failing to rejoin within a set deadline following the discovery and ruling on a specific bug that referees found had triggered in a previous match. </p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">As DBDLeague Season 9 continues through June, the official body recently issued a statement explaining that Team Tremor, one of the competing teams, had been disqualified. To be clear, the official statement says that Team Tremor was disqualified for quitting the league’s voice chat and failing to rejoin within the given time limit. All this came about, though, because of a bug and the referee ruling around it. </p>
 <h2 id="h-team-tremor-quit-dbdleague-following-a-ruling-on-a-known-unhooking-bug" data-injectable="false">Team Tremor quit DBDLEague following a ruling on a known unhooking bug</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">The statement from DBDLeague was issued soon after Team Tremor was disqualified. It details the events as they occurred, showing how all teams were made aware of a bug that prevents <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-survivor-perks-in-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivors</a> from unhooking each other if the Killer is too close to the hook. That bug was triggered during a Team Tremor match, and referees subsequently decided that a rematch was in order. Team Tremor would be penalized, though not that severely. </p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">DBDLeague is clear that this decision was made in the interest of fairness. The bug is inconsistent and could have been triggered accidentally, which is why Team Tremor wasn’t penalized as harshly as it would have been in other instances and why a rematch was on the cards. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Team Tremor, for whatever reason, quit the DBDLeague voice chat after hearing the decision and never returned. As a result, it’s been disqualified from Season 9. The players have been suspended indefinitely in an effort by DBDLeague to demonstrate the integrity of the Esport. </p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/brnfrmawsh/status/1802294574640984259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ahren</a> posted a few videos showing the bug in action and Team Tremor being informed of the ruling. Multiple times, it was made clear to the team that they were not being accused of cheating or deliberately triggering the bug, but they quit and disappeared regardless. </p> <figure data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">DBDLeague is the closest thing to a <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em> Esport that you’ll find. In it, teams of players compete to achieve the best performance against each other in groups of five, split up into a team of Survivors and a single Killer. Not all players jump into the same match together. Instead, one team’s Killer will play against another team’s Survivors, and vice versa, and the results of those matches decide who emerges victorious. </p>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="false">The <em>Dead by Daylight</em> Esport scene has struggled to get off the ground ever since the game was released. Bugs and constant Perk and Killer tweaks from Behaviour Interactive have made it extremely difficult to establish fair competition for everyone. However, DBDLeague seems to be doing a great job in its ninth season so far. Rulings like this might be difficult, but they do show the severity with which any potential cheating is treated. </p>

		<p>CI Games has announced the development of a sequel to Lords of the Fallen for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, targeting a 2026 release.

<p>In our Lords of the Fallen review, Jason said, <em>“I desperately want to like Lords of the Fallen, but it’s the first game all year that’s actively annoyed me.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is set 10 years after Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A session held on Discord and relayed by Shinobi602, the team confirmed several hitherto unknown aspects of the highly anticipated sequel, including the news that The Inquisitor will "definitely be part of the story".</p>
<p>We also learned a little more about how the game will be unfold, including news that, unlike Inquisition, there will be no power mechanic to block progress, locations can change based on your choices, and you can return to complete side quests – which are described as "handcrafted and story focused" – in locations you've already visited. The team also said that there will be no "fetch quests".</p>

<p>Furthermore, your origin story "will come into play a lot during the course of the game", "giving you opportunities to define who your Rook was and is, and lots of dialogue options".</p>
<p>The team also said that it has decided to drop the party size from three to two in order to focus on a "much more intimate experience" in which you'll have to balance the skills of your companions much more carefully than prior Dragon Age instalments.</p>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creator-says-veilguards-approach-to-romance-isnt-a-huge-surprise-following-baldurs-gate-3">David Gaider recently shared his thoughts on Dragon Age: The Veilguard's romance options</a>. Gaider, who is the creator of Dragon Age and lead writer on the series' previous instalments, offered up a lengthy thread on social media platform X where he compared the romance approach to the popular Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>"I guess the move in [Dragon Age: The Veilguard] to 'all companions are romanceable by everyone' isn't a huge surprise, considering [Baldur's Gate 3], but - unsurprisingly - I have a few thoughts," Gaider said, before acknowledging the "fandom is pretty split on romance design".</p>
<p>For more, Chris went hands-on with Dragon Age: The Veilguard earlier this week, and he was rather taken with it. "Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," he wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard preview</a>.</p>

            <p>Plus FromSoft is happy to "consider ideas like that with our future games".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is okay with you playing Elden Ring in co-op – even if you're using mods to buddy up "beginning to end".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftwares-says-elden-rings-seamless-co-op-mod-is-definitely-not-something-we-actively-oppose-and-may-even-consider-ideas-like-that-with-our-future-games/">PC Gamer</a>, FromSoftware president Miyazaki was asked his thoughts on the modding community's efforts to tweak Elden Ring's features, including the Seamless Co-op mod that permits players to team up beyond mere boss fights.</p>
<p>Miyazaki confirmed that while the team intentionally designed a "casual" system wherein you could "drop in, defeat a boss, drop out", it does not "actively oppose or downplay" Tarnished who prefer to take on the horrors of The Lands Between with a pal by their side.</p>

<p>"It's definitely not something we actively oppose or want to downplay, wanting to go through the whole game together," Miyazaki said. "In terms of where we were with Elden Ring, it was simply a case of wanting that more loose, casual style – drop in, defeat a boss, drop out. It doesn't put any technical restrictions on the player, it just sort of lets them complete this focus and then move on, so to speak.</p>
<p>"That's not to say we won't consider other ways like you and your friend played, from beginning to end, total co-op – that's not to say we won't consider ideas like that with our future games."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring has now shipped an impressive 25m units worldwide</a>.</p>
<p>On its initial release back in February 2022, Elden Ring was an immediate hit. In just over two weeks, it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-described-as-start-of-a-new-franchise-following-enormous-12m-sales-milestone">shifted 12m copies</a>, with publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware describing these sales as "a fantastic start for the new franchise".</p>
<p>By the time we got to May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-134m-copies-since-launch">sales had surpassed 13.4m</a>, and rose further to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-surpass-166m-worldwide">16.6m by August</a>. A year after it made its Tarnished debut, it was revealed Elden Ring had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-an-astonishing-20m-copies">sold 20m copies</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-next-fallout-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/todd-howard-%E2%80%98we-don%E2%80%99t-need-to-rush%E2%80%99-next-fallout-game.902916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-next-fallout-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Todd Howard, arguably the face of Bethesda Game Studios, recently sat down and spoke at length about the Fallout franchise – both the future and present of the series’ ecosystem. As you can imagine, one of the first questions to come up was regarding the next step in the series – the <strong>next Fallout game</strong>. However, Howard’s answer wasn’t necessarily one that would fill Fallout fans worldwide with hope of anything coming anytime soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-has-never-been-more-popular">‘Fallout Has Never Been More Popular’</h2>



<p>In an hour-long interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Todd Howard took a deep dive into all things Bethesda Game Studios, touching on Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Starfield. He revealed quite a bit about all the franchises under his belt, such as suggesting that the plan is to deploy a premium expansion in Starfield at least once a year moving forward.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Matty Interviews Todd Howard: Future Of Fallout, Starfield Year 2, Elder Scrolls VI Info, &amp; MORE!" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The most interesting portion of the conversation (for some, anyway) was when Todd Howard addressed the next Fallout game. He acknowledged that ‘Fallout has never been more popular’ than it is right now, and that’s mostly thanks to the success of Amazon’s Fallout TV show. He appreciated that millions of players have found their way into the ecosystem in recent months, but he still doesn’t believe there’s any need to move quickly and deploy a new Fallout game to answer the hype.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For other Fallout games in the future, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say sort of rushing through them, or we need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76, you know… We don’t feel like we need to rush any of that. Right now, the Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and story-telling. </p>



<p>I totally get the desire for a new kind of ‘mainline’ single-player game, but those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things, as well. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls or Fallout or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loves these franchises as much as we do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout is a legendary post-apocalyptic series with more than twenty-five years on the market, and from an ambitious MMORPG to a diverse array of first- and third-person action RPG titles, the franchise has dominated the category it has spearheaded for so long. Fans are hungry for another single-player story, but it seems that they’ll need to wait several years for that to surface. It might have already been nine years since the last single-player game appeared in the series, but there’s plenty for Bethesda Game Studios to be working on right now that takes precedence over Fallout.</p>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dig-into-magical-delicacy-a-delicious-metroidvania-lite-when-its-served-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magical Delicacy</a></em> blends some of the best parts of 2D action platformers and Metroidvanias to create something altogether new. It’s the type of game that would work perfectly on a handheld platform like the Switch and maybe even the Steam Deck. </p> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Leading up to its release, <em>Magical Delicacy</em> has been confirmed for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. It’s a game that I believe is perfect for handheld mode on the Switch, but I also realize that not everyone has that console. That’s why it would be nice if the game were Steam Deck compatible, so more people could enjoy it while getting comfy and cozy in the evening instead of strictly at a desk.</p>
 <h2 id="h-is-magical-delicacy-steam-deck-compatible" data-injectable="false">Is <em>Magical Delicacy</em> Steam Deck compatible?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Magical Delicacy Announcement Trailer - Whitethorn Winter" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTvkuQZGYgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Yes, developer Skaule has confirmed that <em>Magical Delicacy</em> will be Steam Deck compatible from day one. A few fans reported having success running the demo soon after <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-game-in-the-access-ability-summer-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June’s various game showcases</a>, so I reached out for confirmation. That’s how I know you, and I will be able to load this deliciously delightful game on our Steam Decks at launch.</p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">In <em>Magical Delicacy</em>, you play a young witch who has moved to a new town to train her skills by helping out the locals. As you meet more and more people around the town and help them through food or your flair for magic, you’ll unlock more and more of the location and uncover the town’s past and those who helped build its history. </p> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">The gameplay revolves around 2D platforming and ingredient gathering. You’ll unlock more recipes as you progress and must upgrade your kitchen to ensure you can cook everything required by the townsfolk. The game allows you to create a completely custom kitchen while still maintaining that sense of progression that will be key to making you want to push through to see the story to the end. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to deny that the Switch is the ideal place to play 2D platformers and Metroidvanias when games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-metroid-dread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Dread</a></em> run so well on it. I’m a huge fan of Valve’s Steam Deck because it allows other similar games to run in a handheld format even when the developer hasn’t released its game for Nintendo’s hybrid console. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="false"><em>Magical Delicacy</em> combines the thrill of progression from Metroidvianias and action from 2D platformers with the cozy themes of cooking and building a place to call home in a scary and new place. I can’t imagine playing it in any way other than handheld mode, and I’m sure I’m not alone. </p>

<p>In a brief but firm <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">statement</a> about the issues, senior director of player relations Will "Soulcrusher" Leverett said the team had now completed an investigation, resulting in over 600 suspensions and the removal of "the illicitly gained aUEC from the Star Citizen ecosystem".</p>

<p>"We've completed an investigation into multiple exploits within Star Citizen that compromised stability and negatively impacted the in-game economy," Leverett said. "As a result, we have resolved multiple aUEC exploits in 3.23.1a, and we've identified and suspended over 600 accounts involved in exploitative behaviours while also removing the illicitly gained aUEC from the Star Citizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Cheating and exploiting undermine the integrity of our game and the efforts of our dedicated backers who help us build Star Citizen. We take these actions seriously and assure you that we are continuously developing additional measures against cheating and exploitation. We will continue to prioritise triaging exploits with the highest urgency to isolate and address these issues as they pop up."</p>
<p>Leverett added that whilst exploits and issues are inevitable at "this stage of development", it was working closely with the community to identify, test, and report exploits.</p>
<p>"We've gained valuable insights through your issue council reports, and we thank you for that," Leverett concluded. "However, once an exploit is identified and confirmed, continued abuse for personal gain will not be tolerated and will result in action on our part.</p>
<p>"Once again, we're super appreciative of your efforts in flagging recent issues and your general support in utilising the Issue Council. We'll keep you updated as we continue to develop measures to ensure fair play."</p>

<p>"After many hard years of work towards a goal many thought was impossible, we are on the cusp of delivering one of the final pieces of technology that will enable a connected, shared universe that thousands of people can experience together at the same time," Roberts explained in his <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">latest Letter from the Chairman update</a> in March.</p>
