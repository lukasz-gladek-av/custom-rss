              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to kick off the Nintendo Switch 2’s first big fall season but it’s now been indefinitely delayed as Gearbox Entertainment works to deliver the “best possible experience” for fans on the new portable console. It’s a surprisingly last-minute move for a game that was supposed to ship in less than two weeks, on October 3. The pivot comes after weeks of heated debate over the loot shooter’s performance on other platforms.</p> <p><span>“We need to share that the release of<em> Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Tuesday evening. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Greetings, Vault Hunters – We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development…</p> <p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The studio said it hopes to peg the new release date for <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 to the arrival of cross saves for all versions of the game, but didn’t provide a release window for that either. “We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans,” the announcement reads.&nbsp;</span><span>In the meantime, all digital pre-orders on the eShop have been canceled in accordance with a Nintendo policy, and will be refunded starting September 26.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The sudden delay comes after lots of complaints about <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765"><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s performance on PC</a> as well as some concerns on other consoles, including an apparent memory leak that makes the game run worse if you play it continuously for long stretches of time without quitting out and relaunching. The game is capped at 30fps on Switch 2, and initial hands-on impressions with the game suggested it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DosYcQK5y2Q">ran well enough</a>, though experiences on Steam Deck have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCMeKugDOQ">reportedly been subpar</a>. Digital Foundry’s analysis of the game across various platforms has also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRWW6qwjFBA">less than glowing</a>.</p> <p>Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAY7wUyCggCEAAYgAQYogQyBwgDEAAY7wUyCggEEAAYogQYiQUyBggFEEUYPNIBCDM1MjhqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">all over social media</a> since the sci-fi sequel launched earlier this month, but hasn’t yet weighed in on the delay as of publishing time.</p>

Most Star Wars LEGO sets have wonderful reviews, usually 4.8 out of 5 on Amazon and both children and adult fans enjoy them. One set that’s flying off the shelves, especially with its all-time lowest price just before Prime Day, is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/">Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi shuttle: Now offered for $54, where it was once $79</a>, it’s a bargain if you’re looking to revisit the galaxy far, far away adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Step Into the World of Star Wars Adventure</h2>
<p>This LEGO set mimics the streamlined and signature look of Ahsoka Tano’s starship in the well-known animated TV series. <strong>With 599 pieces</strong>, the set provides a satisfying build experience that’s <strong>perfect for kids 9 and up</strong> but suitable for adult collectors who desire a displayable model as well. The shuttle includes an opening cockpit that is well-suited to house the included LEGO mini-figures.</p>



<p>The collection includes <strong>four detailed mini-figures: Ahsoka herself, with two lightsabers; Sabine Wren, with two blasters; Professor Huyang, with a wrench; and Marrok, with a double-bladed lightsaber</strong>.</p>
<p>Functionality gets its proper place in this model with two stud shooters and storage bays that can hide tools, weapons and accessories and add realism and interactive play. The landing gear folds up neatly on the shuttle, automatically placing the wings in flight mode.</p>
<p>What makes this offer different from the typical Star Wars attraction is the combination of quality, level of detail, and now phenomenal pricing: Dropping to an all-time low of $54, the set gives children and collectors a chance to pick up a highly rated model at a friendly price at just the right time for holiday shopping or adding to a collection.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>Phil Mistry / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>The American Right, a squirming bundle of grievances held together by supposed reverence for free speech, has been on a cancellation and censorship spree since the killing of Charlie Kirk earlier this month. Publications like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MSNBC</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/15/washington-post-columnist-karen-attiah-fired-charlie-kirk/86169162007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> have yielded to far-right pressure, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as did ABC</a> in the case of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/workers-are-getting-fired-over-posts-mocking-charlie-kirk-s-death/ar-AA1MBTTF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schools, airlines, and even NASDAQ</a> have given staff the boot as the likes of JD Vance and Elon Musk cheer them on from their bully pulpits.&nbsp;</p><p>The witch hunt has made its way to the world of video games as well, with an artist at <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> developer Sucker Punch <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing her job</a> days after Kirk’s death following social media jokes about Kirk and an ensuing mob effort to get her fired. Late last week, a community manager on SWAT game <em>Ready Or Not</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was fired</a> as a result of furor around their take that “nothing of value was lost” when Kirk died. This week, <em>Storm Lancers</em> developer ProbablyMonsters announced it had <a href="https://x.com/prblyMONSTERS/status/1969909019834999137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired an employee</a>, seemingly its global marketing manager, following <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/probablymonsters-is-the-latest-studio-to-fire-someone-for-posting-about-charlie-kirk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series of comments</a> like "Charlie Kirk's epitaph should read 'Worth it for the second amendment.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A firestorm of debate ensued in <em>Ready Or Not</em>’s Discord, where the community manager was active and generally well-liked, with some messages viewed by Aftermath lamenting the studio’s decision while others came to the conclusion that the community manager got their just desserts for “[celebrating] the death of someone for speaking their mind,” not even remotely detecting the irony in celebrating a government-encouraged movement that’s trying to get people fired for… speaking their minds.</p><p>Sucker Punch and <em>Ready Or Not</em> developer Void Interactive did not reply to Aftermath’s requests for comment as of this publishing. A ProbablyMonsters representative declined to provide additional details.</p><figure><blockquote><p>There are no dogwhistles anymore.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Those behind an email campaign targetting <em>Warhammer </em>publisher Games Workshop have claimed that they <a href="https://x.com/pr_of_hell451/status/1968757256540811624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully got an employee suspended</a> for saying on Facebook that he isn’t shedding any tears over Kirk’s death because Kirk was "a fascist cunt carrying enormous amounts of water for a side that has no compunctions committing structural and systemic political violence against the working class and the people of Gaza," but Games Workshop has not publicly confirmed the suspension or replied to Aftermath’s request for additional details.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, aggrieved Kirk stans have <a href="https://x.com/Microsoft/status/1966626714148368766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced a statement out of Microsoft</a>, seemingly in relation to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777664/elon-musk-charlie-kirk-satya-nadella-fire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments from Blizzard employees</a>, about how it takes “matters like this very seriously” and is “currently reviewing each individual situation,” as well as Bandai Namco, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemned</a> “AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.” (Bandai Namco has since deleted the statement.) Bethesda was also <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/clip-removed-fascism-row" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressured into deleting an <em>Indiana Jones</em> promotional post</a> in which Indy pet a cat and said, “You don’t care much about those fascists, do you?,” because apparently the people behind these campaigns have just decided to say the quiet part out loud now.</p><p>The Gamergate 2.0 mob responsible for recent tea kettle storms, marshalled by the likes of nearly-60-year-old games industry washout Mark “Grummz” Kern and MMO streamer-turned-political-pundit Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, has been kicking around for quite some time, beginning to percolate even prior to the emergence of the modern anti-woke movement and then roaring to life on the back of last year’s still-ridiculous <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Baby Inc conspiracy theory</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent events have, unsurprisingly, galvanized the aforementioned influencers and their ilk, with Kern, Hoyt, the KotakuInAction subreddit, and a menagerie of other YouTubers and community members plucking game developers who’ve spoken ill – or even not entirely reverently – of Kirk from relative obscurity and instructing followers to get them cancelled (which usually means fired). While Hoyt has <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1966430272838074510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised to</a> “do this until [offending developers] are all gone or the companies that protect them have their reputations destroyed beyond repair,” he’s spent the past week and change out of action following the passing of his father. In his stead, a segment of his Twitter community, <a href="https://x.com/i/communities/1853165142885679514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roach Ranch</a>, has taken up the cause of naming and shaming developers who shuffle a toe out of line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tandem to this effort, a Steam user created a curator page called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45778915-CharlieTweetsDetected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CharlieTweetsDetected</a> that lists games worked on by developers who “celebrated the tragedy” of Kirk’s death. Reminiscent of a similar Sweet Baby Inc Detected page from 2024, it currently boasts over 28,000 followers and has already given a thumbs-down to over 100 games.&nbsp;</p><p>This all sounds bad, and in many ways, it is. Developers and personalities identified by these groups are facing increased harassment – some for the first time in their careers.</p><p>"This is my first time getting swept up in a harassment campaign," a developer who made Charlie Kirk-related comments on social media and who was granted anonymity out of concern that speaking openly could spur further harassment told Aftermath. "It was surreal to watch a video where I was directly referenced along with my colleagues ... where [Asmongold] said he wanted to ‘ruin our lives,’ and that we were ‘animals – and that's exactly what they are, you shouldn't view them as people, you shouldn't view them as a person with a political disagreement with you, these are violent animals.’ It's practically a 1:1 quote for Goebbels’ ‘These are not humans, but animals’ <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-animals-hitler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> about Jewish people. There are no dogwhistles anymore, and not only has YouTube kept that video up – and, I'm assuming, monetized – but that video has been seen several million times."</p><figure><blockquote><p>This is the first time I've actually had to recommend other people lock down their accounts on the basis of me being targeted. You just don't know who else they're going to find an excuse to harass.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Some have been forced to at least temporarily shut down social media accounts to avoid being bombarded with harassment, which the mob has taken as (spurious) evidence that they have been fired from their jobs.</p><p>“What's remarkable about this instance,” another developer who made Charlie Kirk-related comments on social media and who was granted anonymity to avoid further harassment told Aftermath, “is that a) at least in my case, they have been much more successful in getting their followers to expend the effort to harass me on an individual basis, b) the campaign has been much more sustained, whereas usually it dies off rather quickly when they don't get what they want, and c) they are expanding their field of targets nigh indiscriminately. You usually see them targeting one person at a time, more often than not marginalized people who aren't high up in the company, but this time they're happy to add even C-suiters to their list. This is the first time I've actually had to recommend other people lock down their accounts on the basis of me being targeted. You just don't know who else they're going to find an excuse to harass, and that part in particular is alarming.”</p><p>Kirk zealots have crept into unexpected places as well – for example, the personal Discord of an Australian fighting game commentator Teq, who was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theteqnique.tv/post/3lywxtam7lc2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed</a> from a community-run <em>Street Fighter</em> organization called SFAustralia after saying “get got idiot” in response to Kirk’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm incredibly surprised at how effective and far-reaching the campaign has been,” Teq told Aftermath. “I think what was particularly shocking for our scene is how POC- and queer-centric the fighting game community is, so to see it rearing its head all the way down here in Australia blindsided us all."&nbsp;</p><p>Another SFA member was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/midnightaus.bsky.social/post/3lyxmu3zbos27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed not long after</a>, also for comments made outside SFA’s channels.</p><p>But while some companies and organizations have beaten a hasty retreat in the face of this campaign, you can still – as of this writing, at least – count the number of people whose actual jobs it’s impacted on one hand, compared to the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/18/charlie-kirk-comments-prompt-firings-across-us/86216872007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100+ who’ve been fired or disciplined in other sectors</a>. This despite an ongoing campaign with dozens of targets (hundreds if you count the CharlieTweetsDetected list). The broader shape of the grievance machine, it seems, has not changed all that much in light of recent events, and given that some version of this has been going on for years, savvier companies have grown wise to its tactics.</p><p>"Generally studios are pretty good at identifying the rabble as just that and protecting their employees," another game creator, who was granted anonymity out of concern over further harassment and who has been a repeat target of harassment mobs, told Aftermath. "Hell, when those guys lost their minds over a stray tweet of mine and tried to get me fired from [a company], the subreddits they posted in also just came to my defense and shut them down. They are certainly good at generating harassment, but no, I haven't personally seen any real ramifications of their campaigns. … I and others have found that these idiots generally lose interest and move on to something new given time. If there was a legit way to stop it that would be great, but there’s basically no path to that outside of litigation, and I cannot afford that."</p><p>One streamer in whose direction Roach Ranch’s Eye of Sauron recently turned wasn’t even aware.</p><p>"I've barely heard a peep,” they told Aftermath. “Been dogpiled by Gamergate people in the past, [and] that led to torrents of abuse/threats. [I was] harassed to the point I had to close my account for weeks at a time before. Seem to have dodged a bullet this time, I guess?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>They are certainly good at generating harassment, but no, I haven't personally seen any real ramifications of their campaigns. … I and others have found that these idiots generally lose interest and move on to something new given time.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The creator of <em>Cruelty Squad</em>, an unabashedly political immersive sim for which a fan made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcVAKSofAs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreation of Charlie Kirk’s shooting</a>, has gone so far as to poke the hornet’s nest, <a href="https://x.com/CSoftproducts/status/1968340767719690466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taunting</a> those attempting to review bomb the game and <a href="https://x.com/CSoftproducts/status/1968565358781972806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly boasting</a> of a resultant sales bump.</p><p>“The amount of negative reviews has been quite low,” the <em>Cruelty Squad</em> developer Consumer Softproducts, who shared the Charlie Kirk map on Bluesky, told Aftermath. “I’ve also noticed that many of their [Twitter] posts haven’t actually gained much traction, with my quote tweets of them getting more likes than the original posts. Also, the sales count went up by around 40 percent compared to recent average.”</p><p>"I think even the conservatives generally don't give a shit about the Charlie Kirk stuff,” they added. “They're obviously not going to communicate that because of their internal thought policing."</p><p>The creator of the <em>Cruelty Squad</em> Charlie Kirk map agrees.</p><p>“The subsequent right-wing virtue signalling was just surreal to watch," the map creator told Aftermath. "It's all so fake and performative and clearly inorganic. They're not even actually making political or moral statements. It's just whining and grandstanding. Nobody on the left or right actually sees Charlie as a human being during this whole thing – just a tool or component to use. So might as well put him in a videogame as a low-poly caricature barely resembling a man because it's funny."</p><p>The CharlieTweetsDetected Steam list and sustained harassment campaigns of developers on major games, you’d think, would lead to a flood of negative reviews, but even games like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> – a Roach Ranch fixation – have only seen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/39210/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a trickle</a>.</p><p>The developer who’s weathering their first real harassment storm described the impact as “relatively mild.”</p><p>"I'm lucky enough that my workplace has seemed to come to the conclusion that there is more value in retaining me as an employee and providing me resources to support me through the harassment rather than firing me," they said. "I don't feel that this harassment campaign is necessarily new or different for the most part; queer people and women in games – especially queer, women of color in games – have been bearing the brunt of targeted harassment campaigns simply for who they [are] since the Gamergate days. Of course there's the open secret that Gamergate never went away, but rather just pivoted to being the alt-right community, so the harassment never truly ended."&nbsp;</p><p>The mob has cast a wide net, though, and its harassment campaigns vary in severity. While some are quickly abandoned, others have persisted for days or weeks. And of course, a few have resulted in firings. Though the developer who’s had to tell other people to lock down accounts remains employed at a major studio, they don’t like the precedent a (so far) small handful of video game companies are setting.</p><p>“In my opinion, every company that has caved to their demands has contributed to the harassment and climate of fear the rest of us are enduring, and game companies that have done so, in particular, have painted a target on the back of every single person in this industry,” the developer said. “Frankly, I’m pissed.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;There's the open secret that Gamergate never went away, but rather just pivoted to being the alt-right community, so the harassment never truly ended.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I recently heard someone say they find it disturbing that the American right reacts with the same amount of outrage to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/23/1150844961/tucker-carlsons-war-on-m-ms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">green M&amp;M</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/cracker-barrel-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cracker Barrel</a>, and the killing of a public figure. This lack of focus is a feature – not a bug – but it also means their movements are uniquely prone to running out of steam unless someone is constantly shoveling fresh fuel onto the fire. Gamergate in its various incarnations has been at it longer than just about any other, and its basic rhythm is revealing: Figureheads like Kern and Hoyt provide new controversies every week, especially as core crusades wane. Barely anybody cares about Sweet Baby anymore; dozens of uniting causes have come and gone since. Kirk is the latest, but eventually the bloom will fall off that rose as well. A lack of overall effectiveness and general disinterest in the review bomb efforts that often undergird these things suggest that might already be happening. Time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not to suggest a lack of caution or alarm, but rather to say that fascism is neither inevitable nor unassailable. The component parts of the modern movement, especially, are rusty and in need of constant replacement – a weak point as much as it is a necessity in this era of social-media-fried attention spans. While more companies than usual are capitulating to Gamergate 2.0’s latest all-out assault, a significant number are evidently aware of its tactics, demonstrating that even if this kind of grievance movement regularly swaps out pieces, the larger apparatus can still break down. That approach renders it necessarily hollow – less a Trojan horse and more a one-trick pony.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it is worth remembering that despite the seeming wave of Kirk-a-mania sweeping the nation, this is all heinously unpopular outside a specific far-right bubble that’s being inflated to look much bigger than it actually is by corporate cowardice. Trump’s approval rating <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/trump-approval-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues to drop</a> following Kirk’s death, with just 39 percent of Americans giving him a thumbs up. The Kimmel suspension resulted in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bencollins.bsky.social/post/3lzbv62abuk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-high search interest in deleting Disney Plus</a>. Disney has already <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oliverdarcy.bsky.social/post/3lzh5lpfips2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">elected to lift the suspension</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>More alarming, however, is the fact that the right has spent years constructing <a href="https://defector.com/the-united-states-of-snitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an infinitely re-deployable Snitch Force</a> just in time for the government to begin openly cracking down on free speech. Kimmel’s suspension – which came hours after Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, threatened to “take action” against ABC – is the most high-profile example, but Trump and his cronies have repeatedly spoken of a much wider crackdown on <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/texas-congressman-says-trans-people-need-to-be-taken-off-the-streets-after-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trans people</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-republicans-cancel-culture-wars-rcna232152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left-wing organizations</a>, and anything that falls under the extremely broad umbrella of “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sign-order-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization-2025-09-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antifa</a>.” In order to effectively enforce the speech-curtailing policies to come, they’ll need citizens to tell on each other early and often.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Every company that has caved to their demands has contributed to the harassment and climate of fear the rest of us are enduring.</p></blockquote></figure><p>A version of this is already playing out elsewhere in the gaming world. For more than a year, a group of streamers, their communities, and increasingly, <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a> have <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed to get leftist politics streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker banned</a> from Twitch, largely on the laughable basis that his Palestine advocacy constitutes open support of terrorism. This movement has unsurprisingly been emboldened by Kirk’s killing, <a href="https://x.com/Grummz/status/1966558139131850924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syncing up with Kern and co</a> to suggest that Piker is a prime example of the “violent” left-wing rhetoric that’s inspiring all the nation’s killers (<a href="https://theconversation.com/right-wing-extremist-violence-is-more-frequent-and-more-deadly-than-left-wing-violence-what-the-data-shows-265367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source: trust me, bro</a>). It is only with this context in mind that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s decision to request Twitch’s presence – in addition to that of Discord, Steam, and Reddit – <a href="https://aftermath.site/us-oversight-committee-online-radicalization-hearing-discord-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at an upcoming Kirk-inspired radicalization hearing</a> makes even the slightest bit of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s impossible to predict exactly what committee members will do on October 8, there’s a very good chance they’ll badger Twitch CEO Dan Clancy about Piker’s continued presence on the platform, something I don’t imagine his bosses at Amazon would love. Already, Twitch has <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-what-mizkif-say-charlie-kirk-s-death-streamer-gets-banned-twitch-comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended</a> popular streamer and <a href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OTK</a> co-founder Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo for jokes about Kirk’s death, though the company wound up <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1969435549652996150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">un-suspending him</a> mere hours later. The next few weeks, then, will prove to be a litmus test of Twitch and Amazon’s ability to weather Trump’s censorious storm.&nbsp;</p><p>The developer who’s had to tell others to lock their accounts believes those in charge of gaming companies should understand what they're dealing with by now.</p><p>“If leaders are convinced that caving will take the heat off of them, or that it's worth getting rid of ‘troublesome’ employees because they will never say the wrong thing themselves, they have failed in their absolute bare-minimum duty to pay attention to the landscape of the industry,” the developer said. “Yes, the situation is more severe and more urgent now, but the overall trend has been the same since Gamergate, and there's absolutely no excuse for not understanding that.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism"><h3>I Love Silksong Even When It Bugs Me</h3></a><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is a once-in-a-generation platformer and a labor of love.

              <p>Valve awarded Steam user SonixLegend a special achievement on Tuesday. It’s called the “Game Collector” badge, and it was bestowed upon SonixLegend after they purchased over 40,000 Steam games. As far as we know, they’re the only person to have ever done it. Cool! But also how?</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/behold-the-first-steam-user-to-own-40-000-games-claim-the-biggest-hoarder-badge-valve-can-offer-and-build-the-pc-gaming-library-of-alexandria/"><em>Gamesradar</em> reports</a>, SonixLegend <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/behold-the-first-steam-user-to-own-40-000-games-claim-the-biggest-hoarder-badge-valve-can-offer-and-build-the-pc-gaming-library-of-alexandria/">has a reputation</a> in the Steam community for being the super-user even among super-users. Based in Shanghai, China according to their public records, they’ve been active on Valve’s PC gaming storefront for over a decade and have an account level of 303. They’ve been collecting games for years and it’s finally caught up with them in the form of a new Steam record.</p> <p>Thanks to places like SteamDB, we can glean all sorts of weird info about SonixLegend’s collection. Technically, they have 97,000 titles in their account, but majority of them are junk that don’t qualify for the achievement. If you were somehow able to magically refund everything in the library at today’s prices, the total catalog would be worth over <a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198028121353/">$640,000</a>. Man, would it suck to lose the password to that account or get banned for breaking Valve’s TOS.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628034">Valve / SteamDB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198028121353/"><em>Polygon</em> estimated</a> that it would take over seven years to beat every game in SonixLegend’s collection. But at the rate they’re actually going, that will probably never happen. SonixLegend’s actual favorite game, ironically enough, is a free-to-play co-op shooter called <em>Alien Swarm</em>. It came out back in 2010. They have played it for over 550 hours. They also have over 100 Steam products that cost more than $200 each.</p> <p>But while SonixLegend is currently winning Steam, they’re hardly the only person gunning for the 40K achievement. A <a href="https://steamdb.info/badge/13/">leaderboard shows</a> nearly 20 other Steam users who all have over 30,000 games in their libraries. SonixLegend appears to be in a semi-direct race with at least one in particular who goes by&nbsp;<a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198017975643/" rel="nofollow">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>. They’re the current runner-up with 39,497 qualifying games. Just, uh, another 533 to take first place. The current value of their library is $542,444. But being the first to 45,000, assuming Valve adds an achievement for that? Priceless.</p> <p>The money for Gabe Newell’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">next yacht</a> has to come from somewhere.</p>

With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> having received an indefinite delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">back in June</a>, that just leaves one game to test whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. While this one has been cooking for a while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-prepares-to-stake-its-claim-in-making-extraction-shooters-popular-with-an-october-release-date">it actually has a release date</a>, October 30th. There's been a few tests along the way, and it turns out the devs have one last one in them!
</p>
<p>
The good thing about this test - they're calling it a Server Slam - is that it's completely open to everyone. You don't need any kind of access code, and despite this announcement coming with the shooter's pre-order trailer, you do not in fact have to pre-order it either. This test is taking place between October 17th and 19th, across PC and console, and essentially it's just to get as many people playing as possible to ensure there are no server hiccups when the game actually launches.
</p>

<p>
Apparently this test will take place on the Dam Battlegrounds map for those in the know, and you'll be able to get a taste of the game's progression, crafting, and quest systems. It's worth noting that none of this progress will carry over to the full game, so don't get too deep into it. You'll get a backpack cosmetic as a little treat in the full game for your troubles at least.
</p><p>
I've said it before on this site and I'll say it again, I'm not particularly big on shooters, but I'm always curious about a burgeoning genre or subgenre. Sure extraction shooters aren't exactly new, but they are quite hard to recommend given how easy it can be to lose progress. Not sure if I'll be jumping in at launch, though I'll be keeping my eye on it to see how things go at least.
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders is out October 30th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Starting a Pokemon card collection can be exciting but also overwhelming when you’re figuring out where to begin. If you’re just getting into it, here’s a deal that’s hard to pass up: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">an assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards for just $5, down from $9</a>. That’s around 40% off the regular price, and $0.10 for each card. Now, you will not be opening up rare cards, and there could be duplicates that show up, but this is a wonderful way to start your collection under way without spending too much money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How to Build Your Pokemon Collection with a Budget Boost</h2>
<p>This mixed bag is a <strong>mix of standard Pokemon cards and energy cards</strong> from a variety of series with a surprise feature that makes it interesting. You never know what you are going to receive in each pack, so the excitement from not knowing which cards appear adds some zip to the action. <strong>Value is in terms of quantity and mix rather than rarity</strong>, so it is ideal for beginners wanting to establish a good foundation set or for backyard collectors who want cheap means of expanding their collection.</p>



<p>The randomness does have some dups but that’s just the bet for bulk purchasing at this price level. Silver lining is that dups can be used to make trades with buddies or strengthen your deck by having multiples of a specific card. Over time, this encourages more interaction with fellow gamers and collectors.</p>
<p><strong>For $5 for 50 cards, this deal lowers the entry price for Pokemon players and collectors</strong>. It is a solid choice if you have been eager to start playing without spending a lot of money upfront.</p>
<p>Sure, you may not get the super-huge ones here, but the thrill is in unpacking the boxes, organizing cards, and discovering new favorites. And for serious players, these base cards provide the foundation for trades and deck enhancements.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-is-clearing-out-its-summer-stock-of-mini-4k-drones-prices-back-to-black-friday-lows-2000627999</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-is-clearing-out-its-summer-stock-of-mini-4k-drones-prices-back-to-black-friday-lows.1305870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Choosing the right drone can feel like a real challenge with so many options out there. But if you’re just starting out or flying for fun, there’s one key thing to keep in mind: <strong>your drone should weigh under 250 grams to avoid the hassle of FAA registration</strong> and Remote ID requirements.</p>
<p>That narrows your choices quite a bit, and luckily, DJI offers two solid options in that category. The ultimate bang for your buck <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/">is the Mini 4K — and right now, it’s available on sale at an all-time low of $249, down from $299, at Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Drone with Impressive Power and Precision</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K is not just light but it’s also designed to impress. Its small body is lightweight but it’s what it does in the air that truly counts: Loaded <strong>with a 4K Ultra HD camera and combined with a 3-axis gimbal stabilization system</strong>, it records video with silky, movie-quality smoothness. Whether capturing a sunrise, sunset, or nighttime scene, the sharpness and clarity are excellent. This means <strong>you don’t necessarily need to be an expert to create professional-grade videos</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to its brushless motors, the Mini 4K supports <strong>wind resistance as high as 38 kilometers per hour</strong> — that’s Level 5 wind resistance. It also comes with the ability to <strong>take off and fly at altitudes as high as 4,000 meters</strong>. This guarantees that your flying experience is still stable and sensitive even if the weather gets a bit challenging.</p>



<p>The increased battery life adds an important plus to your flight duration: You can purchase sets that include one battery for 31 minutes (like that one on sale at Amazon), two batteries total of 62 minutes, or even three batteries where you can fly for up to 93 minutes.</p>
<p>Casual flyers and beginners will appreciate its simplicity and safety features: With one-tap takeoff and landing, GPS-enabled “Return to Home” and automatic hovering, even those new to drones can quickly get comfortable behind the controls. Plus, the DJI Fly app offers in-app tutorials to speed up the learning process so you’ll be flying and capturing your best shots in no time. The Mini 4K also comes with intelligent QuickShots like Helix, Dronie, Rocket, Circle, and Boomerang that make tricky flying maneuvers a breeze and capture stunning shots with only a few taps.</p>
<p>If you want to try aerial photography, this drone is the ideal friend.</p>

		<p>Kojima is teaming up with Niantic to create a new… thing. It’s not a game, but will “l<span lang="EN-US">everage Niantic Spatial’s geospatial AI technology to bring Hideo Kojima’s iconic storytelling into the real world. </span>”</p>
<p>The video makes it look like some sort of AR app that might expand on the mechanism in Death Stranding that allowed you to leave markers and notes for other players. That’s just a guess but we do know NSAND is not linked to Niantic’s other big game,<a href="https://ingress.com/en"> Ingress.</a></p>

<p>“The collaboration marks a significant moment for both companies and a shared vision to push the boundaries of what’s possible in interactive storytelling. For KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS, it’s a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world,” say Kojima Productions.</p>

<p>“At Niantic Spatial, we’re building a living model of the world that people and machines can talk to, creating a new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction,” said John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Spatial. “We are delighted to be working with KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS to explore what our combined creativity and innovation can accomplish for new and existing fans.”</p>

In Baby Steps, "unemployed failson" Nate must traverse a "mountain-sized mountain" using the power of putting one foot in front of the other using the game's unique (and by the look of it, frustrating) physics-based control scheme. The stream highlights various landscapes from the game that Nate must overcome and presents them as serene, idyllic vistas.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjgjDYppxbA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xjgjDYppxbA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Every few minutes, however, the stream takes a sharp turn as Nate comes tumbling down some rocks or faceplants into the dirt, mimicking the experience more than a few Baby Steps players are having themselves. It's never not funny, in large part because it's easy to forget it's going to happen while the stream runs in the background on a second monitor, only for the peaceful sounds of nature to be suddenly interrupted by a bumbling oaf crashing through the landscape.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who pay close attention to the stream will notice there's more than just Nate occasionally bursting into view in a physics-based cacophony. Product keys for free copies of Baby Steps occasionally flash across the screen as well, rewarding those who have become entrapped by the meditative experience of waiting for a comically proportioned man-baby to flail onto the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby Steps isn't quite like anything else out there, as is evident by its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/well-this-esrb-description-sure-is-a-wild-ride/1100-6534659/" data-ref-id="1100-6534659">truly wild ESRB rating description</a> that includes the phrase "human/donkey hybrids with exposed male genitalia."

It housed numerous game studios operating under names like "Cauldron," "Iron," "Hidden Grove," "Battle Barge," and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Firewalk Studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It went on to raise over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/multi-studio-game-company-probablymonsters-nets-200-million-to-continue-expansion">$400 million</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/probablymonsters-nets-250-million-to-bolster-development-studios">next three years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, eventually </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-buys-firewalk-studios-from-probablymonsters">selling</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Firewalk Studios to Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2023 for an undisclosed amount.

An internal email sent by Ryan in 2024 stated that Cauldron had been canceled by an unnamed publisher. Sources described a rolling wave of game cancelations from 2023 through 2025, where projects from Iron, Hidden Grove, and Battle Barge were "paused," some developers let go, and others moved to different teams about every 6-9 months, even as new projects were regularly greenlit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Environment artist Carol Ha-Torrez was one of the developers laid off from Battle Barge by ProbablyMonsters in 2024.

"ProbablyMonsters has always been defined by the dedication, hard work, and creativity of its teams," they stated. "In recent years, the gaming industry has been constantly evolving, and building a company in this environment means facing tough choices with no easy answers. Those choices require balancing the immediate needs of our people while understanding the impact they can have."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the same time, we have a responsibility to keep the company healthy for the long term. We believe being responsible isn’t just about getting everything right in the moment. It’s about staying true to our mission of supporting lasting careers in game development. We know this work is never simple, and we work hard every day to learn, adjust, and improve."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Through it all, our priority has remained the same: respecting employees for their contributions and treating them fairly, including giving credits to teams past and present who contribute to our projects. Building a supportive culture has always been central to who we are, and we’re focused on making ProbablyMonsters a place where teams can do their best creative work."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Battle Barge's headcount and direction shifted overnight">Battle Barge's headcount and direction shifted overnight</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In our previous conversation with Ryan, the ProbablyMonsters CEO stated that the company "looked at" the possibility of turning its canceled live service games into standalone premium titles. But Battle Barge's final voyage was far more dramatic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In September 2024 Ryan announced that former developers from Hidden Grove and Iron would be assigned to support Battle Barge's new mission: turning Project Vance into a premium triple-A title that could ship as a standalone game in 2025. The first milestone: a playable "winter build" with a November deadline.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Battle Barge's team size effectively multiplied overnight, jumping from around 30-40 to an estimated 100 developers. Sources said Ryan ignored warnings that adding dozens of workers and changing the scope of the project would make development more difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communication became arduous as developers who previously worked closely together were split into different strike teams assigned to different tasks. One group of Hidden Grove alumni was tasked with building a 10-hour campaign mode from scratch—all while trying to learn new tools, processes, and file structures that had been built over 4 years by an entirely different team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources differed on whether this was a period of "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunch_(video_games)">crunch</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" or not. Some said they kept normal hours, but Ha-Torrez called it a period of "soft crunch," where she witnessed some colleagues submitting Perforce updates at midnight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You could cut the tension with a knife," she said. Other former employees said every day they feared they would lose their jobs, especially after Ryan fired games teams chief product officer Adam Rymer on October 22, which was announced internally via a studio-wide email reviewed by Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the challenges, sources said the development team hit their assigned targets. A playable build of Project Vance was ready to go on October 28, according to one email documenting the results of a build verification test which stated the game was ready for QA testing and internal playtesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But they never had a chance to hit the finish line. On October 28, before the winter build could be finalized, ProbablyMonsters laid off nearly 50 employees and shuttered Battle Barge, rolling the remaining workers onto other projects. ProbablyMonsters then transferred the Project Vance IP and assets to Companion Group to develop </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> inside of a year.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game does not credit former Battle Barge developers. Instead there is a short note in the credits acknowledging the "dedication, creativity, and hard work" of past and present ProbablyMonsters employees. A company spokesperson alluded to this message when asked about Companion Group's involvement in the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The credits for the game reflect the contributions of many teams involved in its development. We respect the work of all teams, past and present, and those contributions are acknowledged in the credits."</span></p><p>The credits of Storm Lancers, which include employees of ProbablyMonsters and Companion Group. Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer reviewed a recording of the Zoom call where laid-off workers demanded to know why there had been no layoff notification as required by the WARN Act. The WARN Act mandates that eligible employers issue advance notice of layoffs if an office or plant is being shuttered, resulting in 50 or more full-time employees losing their jobs. Approximately 54 people had joined the Zoom call.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ha-Torrez and others said it felt like the company planned layoffs and project changes to avoid issuing these notices. Said strategy is "very common" among employers said KUSK Law partner Don McGowan, an external legal expert consulted during this reporting. When asked if the strategy is legal, he said he doesn't feel it's consistent with "the obligations the law places on employers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the recorded call, ProbablyMonsters associate general counsel Kristen Daniels repeatedly stressed that the number of laid-off employees did not cross the mandated threshold. "We've done the math very carefully," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="QA employees were regularly in the crosshairs">QA employees were regularly in the crosshairs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to our sources, like former test manager Douglas Martin, the chaos and confusion at the heart of ProbablyMonsters came from Ryan himself and the cadre of former Bungie colleagues and close friends who staffed his C-suite. Ryan's erratic behavior apparently impacted ProbablyMonsters' centralized QA team well before the shift in direction for Project Vance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2022 he ordered all QA employees to return to the office full-time, even those hired remotely or who were working with remote teams. Some testers lived hours away from the studio. Martin said Ryan was only in the office himself one or two days a week.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He recalled a meeting where Ryan explained to QA testers why they would not receive any additional compensation for having to commute into the office (despite the additional expenses some would incur). "You guys are already paid at the top of the market. You can afford to commute," he said, according to Martin.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After returning to the office, testers were told that Ryan personally monitored when they swiped badges to enter and exit the building. During this time, the division's staffing levels fluctuated, with managers like Martin and department heads like central services head Ron Henseleit being suddenly ousted from the company. Candidates for open QA positions would be interviewed, only for the position to be axed, sometimes allegedly at Ryan's direction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">QA tester Jessica Gonzalez, formerly a workplace organizer for A Better ABK at Activision Blizzard, told Game Developer she recalls being "strung along" for a job at ProbablyMonsters after receiving a verbal offer from Martin in 2024. Martin remembered making the decision to hire Gonzalez and telling her she'd have an offer letter soon—and then being told not to send it. The position was closed a few weeks later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Martin recalled the incident and said "there was no reason not to hire" her, adding that he still feels "really shitty" about what happened to Gonzalez.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">QA workers were also regularly blamed for problems completely outside their control. One former tester recalled that Ryan frequently said QA was responsible for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development not moving at a faster pace, sometimes in meetings with QA staffers from Firewalk Studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At one point, QA testers were tasked with examining network code at Hidden Grove, something they were never trained to do. Later, they became the final point of validation for new Project Vance game features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This latter directive was allegedly issued during a period when all our anonymous sources were aware Ryan had moved his desk into a newly formed "QA bullpen" that many joked was a "panopticon." Ryan apparently insisted that this was not a surveillance measure, but one that would allow him to be the first to check submitted builds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This earned him the moniker of "the world's most expensive tester."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Surveillance, blame games, and &quot;talking shit&quot;">Surveillance, blame games, and "talking shit"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Martin explained to Game Developer that he and Ryan were fellow test leads on the original Xbox in the early 2000s. He had no plans to work with the future ProbablyMonsters CEO after that first encounter, only taking the job at ProbablyMonsters after being assured by then-QA director Prodipto Roy that Ryan had changed his ways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Martin said that seemed to be true—until the shutdown of Cauldron in 2023. Multiple sources told Game Developer that the troubles at the company started around this time. The former test manager alleged that Ryan was surrounded by close allies who enabled his behavior while behaving just as badly themselves. "There's a lot of people working with Harold who are enabling him and doing the same thing," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During this period of tumult, ProbablyMonsters greenlit new projects and hired developers to work on them, only to reverse course without public fanfare, including one from a team called "Icaro" that was internally announced in July 2024, only to be canceled in December of that year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources described multiple occasions where developers interviewed at the company, only to have their offer letters rescinded or put on hold at Ryan's direction. One prospective employee reportedly moved to Washington state to work in-office and leased an apartment only for Ryan to "nuke" her position and rescind her offer letter days before she started.</span></p><p>Character models, 2D art, and shaders from Project Vance are visible across Storm Lancers. Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple sources also claimed that Ryan surveilled employees. He issued regular warnings about remote workers taking any time away from their desks, despite Battle Barge leadership previously stating employees were free to manage their own time and make up work later in the day if needed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan apparently issued these warnings after joining the Battle Barge "AFK" Slack channel where workers would drop notices about their status. He denied internal rumors at the time that he was monitoring employees in a company-wide Slack message reviewed by Game Developer. In it, he claimed these rumors had driven developers to "make up" work filed in project management tool Jira.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources also said Ryan and other members of senior leadership regularly disparaged colleagues behind their backs. "He loves to talk shit," said a former QA tester when describing said comments. Ryan allegedly verbally disparaged Project Vance around some employees, and word of his displeasure with the game spread through the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan took additional swipes at his former colleagues from Firewalk Studios in a series of Slack messages sent while ProbablyMonsters employees discussed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firewalk-and-sony-ground-concord-promise-to-explore-options-for-improvement">the sudden shutdown of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firewalk-and-sony-ground-concord-promise-to-explore-options-for-improvement">Concord</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "As game developers who always seek to love what we do, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should serve as proof of the cautionary tales about building for yourself vs your audience," he said in one message.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In another one sent after Firewalk was shut down, the CEO simply said "they refused to listen for years."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unkept promises, impossible goals">Unkept promises, impossible goals</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ha-Torrez, Martin and all our other sources said Ryan’s behavior flew in the face of promises by ProbablyMonsters to build a positive workplace culture. Ha-Torrez provided a copy of the welcome letter sent by Ryan where he stated that he started the studio in part to make triple-A games "without the burden of developers experiencing difficult cultures, unpredictable compensation, and unstable employment."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I am committed to continuing with the vision of putting people first," he wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One veteran developer pointed to the outsourcing of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and building it off years-old assets from Project Vance as a clear red flag for Ryan's vision of the company. When this developer read our interview with Ryan, they said it felt like the CEO was claiming he figured out a model for making games quickly and sustainably. They were worried other studios would use his model as inspiration.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan's behavior and the chaotic layoffs surrounding Cauldron, Iron, Hidden Grove, and Battle Barge drove all the developers we spoke with to express doubt over Ryan's promise that the studio is on the path to sustainability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's not real," said the veteran developer, alluding to Ryan's professed vision for "short-term" games that act as a financial buffer for larger projects. "I don't want people to believe it's real because that's just not going to work for everyone."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Update 9/23:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This story has been updated to correctly state Adam Rymer's previous job title at ProbablyMonsters as chief product officer.

            <p>
Fancy a kickabout? After launching in the much warmer June (why is it already so cold, it's only bloody September), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a> has finally received its first proper season, elevating it into a true, blue live service game. This comes with, as you may have guessed, a season pass, which comes with a pair of themes for your football stadium, one being iceberg oriented, the other providing a volcanic atmosphere, alongside some new cosmetics too.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the season pass, there are two pretty big additions with this update. First up is crossplay! You know how this works I'm sure, but to spell it out, it means those of you on PC will now be able to play with your console friends, whether you own the game on Steam or through the Epic Games Store. Always a neat thing to have! Then, there's the addition of a 3v3 ranked mode. Typically matches are 5v5, so this will obviously make for a mode with some tactical differences. Sort of like heading to the local park with your mates!

This season also brings some fixes and tweaks through a new patch too. Reactivity and precision should be better now, and whatever the exploit known as the "Ippy Slide" has been nerfed too. Yay? You'll also find that goalkeeper dives have received a rework so that they're more effective against volleys, and as detailed in a press release, "skill-based matchmaking parameters are now stricter, especially in ranked matches, ensuring more evenly matched teams."
</p><p>
Apparently season 2 of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game will also introduce a much more personal 1v1 game mode, and throughout 2026 there'll be new features introduced like clubs and tournaments systems, World Cup-themed events, and "more." Look forward to that, I suppose!

              <p>Boom! Bang! Kablam! Etc. and so on. There will be a lot of that happening today as a big new event on Steam has a whole host of fantastic retro-inspired first-person shooters on sale for the rest of the week.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/boomstock2025">On September 23, Boomstock 2025 started on Steam</a>. The event celebrates “all boomer shooters and retro-inspired” FPS games and features a ton of new trailers, demos, and of course, a load of games on sale. This includes some genuine bangers, like<em> Dusk</em>, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a></em>,<em> Project Warlock</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/"><em>Selaco</em></a>, and<em> Sulfur</em>.&nbsp; But don’t wait too long, as the event wraps up on September 27, which is just a few days away. If you need help picking out a new shooter to buy, here are some of the best and biggest deals we spotted from the event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Nightmare Reaper</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Brutal John 2</em> – $9 ($13)</li> <li><em>Selaco</em> – $19 ($25)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father 2</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Wizordum</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Dusk</em> – $7 ($20)</li> <li><em>Sulfur</em> – $16 ($22)</li> <li><em>Zero Protocol</em> – $7 ($12)</li> <li><em>Project Warlock 1+2</em> – $12 ($27)</li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40K Boltgun</em> – $11 ($22)</li> <li><em>Blood We</em>st – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Heavy Bullets</em> – $2 ($10)</li> <li><em>Viscerafest</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Supplice</em> – $15 ($22)</li> <li><em>Wild Bastards</em> – $9 ($35)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior</em> (2013) – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior 2</em> – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>HROT</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Gravelord</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Quatermain and the Cult of Cthulu</em> – $2.50 ($3)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset Redux</em> – $2 ($20)</li> <li><em>Serious Sam 2</em> – $2.50</li> <li><em>Mycopunk</em> – $11 ($14)</li> <li><em>Graven</em> – $5 ($23)</li> </ul> <p>I’d also like to shout out some demos for upcoming games that you can play for free right now. You totally should check out these games if you love classic shooters. Or <em>Tetris</em>. You’ll see what I mean. Anyway, here are some Boomstock demos worth playing:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sportal</em> – A boomer shooter all about using sports equipment like bats and tennis rackets.</li> <li><em>Blocks for Babies –</em> <em>Tetris</em> meets <em>Doom</em>. It mixes 2D and 3D gameplay. It’s an odd one, but worth checking out.</li> <li><em>Slyders</em> – This one is part<em> Serious Sam</em> and part roguelike, which is already a great pitch, but then you add in a cool cartoon fox protagonist, and you’ve got something special.</li> <li><em>The Last Exterminator</em> – This is the <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> sequel we deserved. This isn’t a new demo; <a href="https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-3d-last-exterminator-demo-boomer-shooter-pc-1850918547">I covered it last year</a>, but it’s a part of the event and still worth checking out.</li> </ul>

<p>There's an old saying that life is not about how many times you fall down but how many times you get back up. In my roughly 13 hours of walking through the surreal mountain wilderness of <em>Baby Steps</em>, I'd conservatively estimate I easily fell down 1,000 times.</p>
<p>If so, I got up 1,001 times, which is the entire point.</p>
<p>When I say "fell down" here, I'm not being metaphorical. In <em>Baby Steps</em>, the only real antagonist is terrain that threatens to send your pudgy, middle-aged, long-underwear-clad avatar tumbling to the ground (or down a cliff) like a rag doll after the slightest misstep. You pilot this avatar using an intentionally touchy and cumbersome control system where each individual leg is tied a shoulder trigger on your controller.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of 3D games, where you simply tilt the control stick and watch your character dutifully run, each step here means manually lifting one foot, leaning carefully in the direction you want to go, and then putting that foot down in a spot that maintains your overall balance. It's like a slightly more forgiving version of <a href="https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">the popular '00s Flash game <em>QWOP</em></a> (which was also made by <em>Baby Steps</em> co-developer Bennett Foddy), except instead of sprinting on a 2D track, you take your time carefully planning each footfall on a methodical 3D hike.</p>

<p>At first, you'll stumble like a drunken toddler, mashing the shoulder buttons and tilting the control stick wildly just to inch forward. After a bit of trial and error, though, you'll work yourself into a gentle rhythm—press the trigger, tilt the controller, let go while recentering the controller, press the other trigger, repeat thousands of times. You never quite break into a run, but you can fall into a zen pattern of marching methodically forward, like a <em>Death Stranding</em> courier who has to actually focus on each and every step.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As you make your halting progress up the mountain, you'll infrequently stumble on other hikers who seem to lord their comfort and facility with the terrain over you in manic, surreal, and often hilarious cut scenes. I don't want to even lightly spoil any of the truly gonzo moments in this extremely self-aware meta-narrative, but I will say that I found your character's grand arc through the game to be surprisingly touching, often in some extremely subtle ways.</p>
<h2>Does this game hate me?</h2>
<p>Just as you feel like you're finally getting the hang of basic hiking, <em>Baby Steps</em> starts ramping up the terrain difficulty in a way that can feel downright trolly at time. Gentle paths of packed dirt and rock start to be replaced with narrow planks and rickety wooden bridges spanning terrifying gaps. Gentle undulating hills are replaced with sheer cliff faces that you sidle up and across with the tiniest of toe holds to precariously balance on. Firm surfaces are slowly replaced with slippery mud, sand, snow, and ice that force you to alter your rhythm and tread extremely lightly just to make incremental progress.</p>

<p>And any hard-earned progress can feel incredibly fragile in <em>Baby Steps</em>. Literally one false step can send you sliding down a hill or tumbling down a cliff face in a way that sets you back anywhere from mere minutes to sizable chunks of an hour. There's no "reset from checkpoint" menu option or <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">save scumming</a> that can limit the damage, either. When you fall in <em>Baby Steps</em>, it can be a very long way down.</p>
<p>This extremely punishing structure won't be a surprise to anyone who has played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/"><em>Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy</em></a>, where a single mistake can send you all the way back to the beginning of the game. <em>Baby Steps</em> doesn't go quite that hard, giving players occasional major checkpoints and large, flat plains that prevent you from falling back too far. Still, this is a game that is more than happy to force you to pay for even small mistakes with huge portions of your only truly irreplaceable resource: time.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion during my playthrough, I audibly cursed at my monitor and quit the game in a huff rather than facing the prospect of spending 10 minutes retracing my steps after a particularly damaging fall. Invariably, though, I'd come back a bit later, more determined than ever to learn from my mistakes, which I usually did quickly with the benefits of time and calm nerves on my side.</p>

<p><em>Baby Steps</em> is also a game that's happy to let you wander aimlessly. There's no in-game map to consult, and any paths and landmarks that could point you in the "intended" way up the mountain are often intentionally confusing or obscured. It can be extremely unclear which parts of the terrain are meant to be impossibly steep and which are merely designed as difficult but plausible shortcuts that simply require pinpoint timing and foot placement. But the terrain is also designed so that almost every near-impossible barrier can be avoided altogether if you're patient and observant enough to find a way around it.</p>
<p>And if you wander even slightly off the lightly beaten path, you'll stumble on many intricately designed and completely optional points of interest, from imposing architectural towers to foreboding natural outcroppings to a miniature city made of boxes. There's no explicit in-game reward for almost all of these random digressions, and your fellow cut-scene hikers will frequently explicitly warn you that there's no point in climbing some structure or another. Your only reward is the (often marvelous) view from the top—and the satisfaction of saying that you conquered something you didn't need to.</p>
<h2>Are we having fun yet?</h2>
<p>So was playing <em>Baby Steps</em> any fun? Honestly, that's not the first word I'd use to describe the experience.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>To be sure, there's a lot of humor built into the intentionally punishing designs of some sections, so much so that I often had to laugh even as I fell down yet another slippery hill that erased a huge chunk of my progress. And the promise of more wild cut scenes serves as a pretty fun and compelling carrot to get you through some of the game's toughest sections.</p>

<p>More than "fun," though, I'd say my time with the <em>Baby Steps</em> felt meaningful in a way few games do. Amid all the trolly humor and intentionally obtuse design decisions is a game whose very structure forces you to consider the value of perseverance and commitment.</p>
<p>This is a game that stands proudly against a lot of modern game design trends. It won't loudly and explicitly point you to the next checkpoint with a huge on-screen arrow. You can't inexorably grind out stat points in <em>Baby Steps</em> until your character is powerful enough to beat the toughest boss easily. You can't restart a <em>Baby Steps</em> run and hope for a lucky randomized seed that will get you past a difficult in-game wall.</p>
<p><em>Baby Steps</em> doesn't hand you anything. Your abilities and inventory are the same at the game's start as they are at the end. Any progress you make is defined solely by your mastery of the obtuse movement system and your slowly increasing knowledge of how to safely traverse ever more treacherous terrain.</p>

<p>It's a structure that can feel punishing, unforgiving, tedious, and enraging in turns. But it's also a structure that leads to moments of the most genuinely satisfying sense of achievement I can remember having in modern gaming.</p>
<p>It's about a miles-long journey starting with a single, halting step. It's about putting one foot in front of the other until you can't anymore. It's about climbing the mountain because it's there. It's about falling down 1,000 times and getting up 1,001 times.</p>
<p>What else is there in the end?</p>

                <p>In response to the Department of Homeland Security's video using Ash Ketchum to promote ICE, The Pokemon Company's ex-legal chief said he "wouldn't touch" it, suggesting some possible reasons why the company might not pursue legal action.</p><p>This week, Homeland Security <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a video to X</a> of an arrest compilation. In between footage of ICE agents handcuffing people at their homes and in their cars are clips from the OG Pokemon TV series, with the famed "Gotta catch 'em all" theme playing in the background. When Ash Ketchum looks up at the sky, the text "The Department of Homeland Security" populates the screen in Pokemon's iconic yellow-and-blue font. As a Poke Ball closes, the camera zooms in on wrists in cuffs. And at the very end of the video, those arrested appear as Pokemon cards with their "crime" described under their picture.</p><p>Fans were understandably upset about this, with many in the comments begging for The Pokemon Company to sue the DHS. However, the company's former legal chief, Don McGowan, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained to IGN</a> why The Pokemon Company likely won't do anything about the video.</p><p>"I don't see them doing anything about this for a few reasons," McGowan started. "First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are insanely publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand. Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p><p>It's unclear what The Pokemon Company proper will do or say in response to the DHS's co-opting of Pokemon and Ash Ketchum. The video is still up and has been reposted by the government body's official account, so it appears as though DHS is happy to continue using Ash and the "Gotta catch 'em all" theme as ICE promotional material.</p>
