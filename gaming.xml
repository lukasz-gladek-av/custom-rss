            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-staff-members-majority-were-subcontractors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, a French outlet <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2126300/wb-games-montreal-keywords-licenciements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named Radio-Canada</a> mentioned that 99 developers have been laid off at WB Games Montreal. It's been said that 99 employees were impacted by this new round of layoffs. However, the vast majority of the employees affected by this round of layoffs were subcontractors hired through Keywords. Keywords is a game service provider that helps connect studios with professionals. They have previously worked with companies such as BioWare and NetEase for their projects. The workers at WB Montreal were in the QA department and helped Rocksteady with the development of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>This news comes after Rocksteady announced that the live-service shooter will no longer be supported as of January 14, 2025. The developers that were impacted by the layoffs mentioned to Radio-Canada that those let go will be made to leave WB Montreal in approximately eight weeks, which is roughly around the start of February.</p>
<p>A source mentioned to Radio-Canada that they were offered the opportunity to be kept on a contact list for any projects that were going to be going forward at WB Games Montreal. However, the source said that the projects may not need any people to work on them until 2026. Although this source has said this, it's not 100% certain that it's true, as they had reportedly been assured that WB Games Montreal had "enough projects to work on."</p>
<p>It's not a surprise to anyone who knows about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League that it performed poorly. As a result of the game performing so badly, Warner Bros. Games revenue saw a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/">hefty 41% decrease in Q2 2024</a>, which is most likely why Rocksteady decided to pull the plug on the game entirely in January. WB Games did expect a drop in revenue, as they didn't release anything this year that was as successful as Hogwarts Legacy, but they were hoping that Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would at least provide some padding.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's a bit uncertain as to what WB Games Montreal is working on, with their most recent game being Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Prior to that, they developed games such as Gotham Knights and Batman: Arkham Origins. While it hasn't been confirmed, WB Games Montreal is allegedly developing a DC Comics game utilizing Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Looking further than Montreal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/">Hogwarts Legacy 2 is the biggest priority for WB Games</a>, given the wide success of Hogwarts Legacy. So much so that the game sold more copies than the WB Games Senior Brand Manager expected.</p>

            <p>
Thursday is upon us once more, meaning another Epic Games Store freebie is here to claim and (ever-mounting backlog allowing) play. And this time, it's the turn of fantasy survival adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> - which is reportedly the first of 16 free games being given away by Epic over the festive period.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Epic's current freebie, though, developer Free Range Games' The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria launched to a decent reception back in 2023, transplanting familiar survival mechanics - exploration, combat, resource gathering, and crafting - to Middle-earth with atmospheric, if largely unspectacular results.
</p>
<p>
"This is a game with a lot of soul and a lot of problems, even if I've still found myself willingly sinking dozens of hours into exploring the mines"," Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review">three star review</a>. "What is unique about Return to Moria is the way it pairs a relatively focused story with survival mechanics... The manner in which the game has been infused with Tolkien's lore and world-building is impressive, and that it somehow evokes the feeling of a Tolkien journey is remarkable in itself. For fans of Middle-earth this is worth experiencing, particularly if someone else joins you for the adventure."

The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-f01344">free to claim</a> right now until Thursday, 19th December. As to what's next, that - somewhat unusually - is yet to be revealed. However, according to extremely reliable leaker billbil-kun, Epic is poised to embark on another series of daily free game giveaways, just as it's done over the festive period for the last few years.
</p><p>
In a post <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/epic-games-store-voici-le-nombre-et-le-calendrier-complet-des-jeux-gratuits-a-venir-lors-de-levenement-de-fin-dannee-59770">on Deallabs</a>, billbil-kun wrote that one new game will be free to claim on the Epic Store every day from 19th December to 2nd January 2025. Each will be claimable for 24 hours, aside from the last, which will be free between 2nd and 9th January.

Instead, it’s an art dealer who sometimes models and happens to be very, very thin. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,197298" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/emaciated-zombie-in-28-years-later-is-not-cillian-murphy-sources-confirm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/emaciated-zombie-in-28-years-later-is-not-cillian-murphy-sources-confirm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em> reported</a></span> this corrective earlier today, dashing a frenzy of excited fan speculation after the <em>28 Years Later</em> trailer dropped earlier this week. The “Emaciated Infected” is actually played by Angus Neill, who director Danny Boyle had previously met and remembered for his extremely gaunt physique, rather than the star of last year’s summer blockbuster <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </p><p>“Danny told me he’d always had me in mind for the role,” Neill, who specializes in Old Masters paintings, told<em> The Guardian</em>. “So we met up, hit it off, and I agreed to take part. He continued, “On set he has an extraordinary ability to hypnotize you, and working with him on the film was a very, very intense experience.”</p><p>Murphy’s character, meanwhile, survived the original <em>28 Days Later</em> but was completely MIA from the sequel <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, which was made by a different director and writing team entirely. With Boyle and script writer Alex Garland teaming back up for the third movie, Murphy is believed to be involved in the project but hasn’t yet been confirmed in the current cast, which includes Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes.</p><p>It’s possible Murphy’s role in the film is a secret to be revealed later, or maybe his character, a random bystander in the first movie, just wouldn’t make any sense showing up in the latest rage virus-fueled apocalypse. For now, fans will have to find something else in the movie’s unsettling trailer to debate. <em>28 Years Later</em> releases on June 20, 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Steel City Interactive has released Update 1.2 for Undisputed boxing on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. To coincide with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jake-paul-added-to-undisputed-boxing-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s first DLC pack</a> of fighters, this update makes several changes across the game including adding a couple of highly-requested features.</p>



<p>Two of the biggest additions are the ability to change weight class in career mode as well two new venues and added weight classes for online quick fights and ranked modes.</p>



<p>You can check out the <a href="https://playundisputed.com/news/undisputed-patch-december-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full patch notes</a> below via Steel City Interactive.</p>



<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-1-2-details">Undisputed Update 1.2 Details</h2>



<h3>New Venues</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added Cambrian Hall. Located in the heart of England’s Capital and draped in rich boxing history, fighting at this venue is every prospect’s dream.</li>



<li>Added Atlantis, an underwater aquarium-like venue, located on the ocean bed. Can you keep your composure in the ring when you’re deep under water?</li>
</ul>



<h3>New Cosmetics</h3>



<ul>
<li>All players will receive an additional free outfit for Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk – recreate their historic first fight in all its glory with their fight-accurate outfits.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Career Mode</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced the ability for players to move up and down a weight class from their starting weight class. We know this is one a lot of you have been asking for and we’re excited to see you step up to the challenge of becoming Undisputed in not one, not two, but three weight classes with the same fighter!</li>



<li>Introduced the esteemed boxing correspondent Gareth A Davies to the Career Mode media feed, the first in a series of real-life media figures and brands.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to the career mode’s UI.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>General Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced Cruiserweight, Bantamweight, and Light Heavyweight queues to online quick fight and online ranked.</li>



<li>Added new knockdown and knockout animations.</li>



<li>Added an animation that plays when a fighter’s block health has been depleted, giving players better visual feedback during gameplay.</li>



<li>Slightly reduced stamina cost on missed punches and power punches to make combination and pressure fighting a more viable option.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to game audio and commentary.</li>



<li>Made performance optimisations to custom characters.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that meant players that quit out of online games on PlayStation weren’t being punished, and the win was not being correctly awarded to the remaining player. This now works as expected.</li>



<li>Many other bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>

Venture is dressed up as Toph, an earthbender who manipulates stone. This is one of the best fits in the collaboration, since Venture’s kit is all about digging to get around the map. Other skins include Zenyatta as Aang, the titular avatar, Mei as Katar, Orisa as Appa, Genji as Zuko, and Kiriko as Suki.</p><p>We still haven’t seen them in motion in the game itself, but Blizzard did release an animated trailer that emulates the visual style of <em>Avatar </em>and its sequel series <em>The Legend of Korra</em>.

<p>The former Marathon game director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired from Bungie</a> early this year for alleged inappropriate contact, has spoken publicly about the allegations. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/oryxeleven/status/1867248221967560952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Christopher Barrett talked about how “difficult and painful” the last nine months have been since leaving Bungie while announcing that he has filed a lawsuit against both Sony and Bungie.</p>



<p>He claims that the claims and “attacks” are unfounded and damaging his reputation.</p>



<p>“The past nine months following my departure from Bungie have been very difficult and painful for me as I’ve had to endure rampant speculation, unfounded attacks on my reputation, and innuendo about what happened behind the scenes to cause me to be fired after 25 years of loyal service,” Barrett said. “I want to thank everyone who has been there for me.”</p>



<p>He continued: “I’ve eagerly awaited the opportunity to get the truth out there and tell my side of the story, and now is that time. Today, I filed a lawsuit against Sony and Bungie to hold them accountable for their conduct and the damage that has been done to my reputation and my career.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that at least eight females came forward with allegations against Barrett. An internal investigation would discover that Barrett would call lower-level employees attractive while also asking them to play truth or dare. In addition, Barrett reported flaunted his “wealth and power” within the company while hinting that he could help people advance their careers.</p>



<p>For his side, Barrett says that his name will be cleared as the lawsuit plays out.</p>



<p>“I am confident that the facts are on my side and look forward to clearing my name through the legal process,” he said. “Because this is a pending legal matter, there is nothing else I can say about it at this time.”</p>

<p>Intel doesn't have a ton to show for its dedicated GPU efforts yet.</p>
<p>After much anticipation, many delays, and an anticipatory <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/poor-dx11-performance-arc-gpus-constant-work-in-progress">apology tour for its software quality</a>, Intel launched its first Arc GPUs at the end of 2022. There were things to like about the A770 and A750, but buggy drivers, poor performance in older games, and relatively high power use made them difficult to recommend. They were more notable as curiosities than as consumer graphics cards.</p>
<p>The result, after more than two years on the market, is that Arc GPUs remain a statistical nonentity in the GPU market, according to <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-aibs-see-significant-surge-in-q2-2024/">analysts</a> and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>. But it was always going to take time—and probably a couple of hardware generations—for Intel to make meaningful headway against entrenched competitors.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/intel-targets-budget-friendly-1440p-gaming-with-249-and-219-arc-b500-gpus/">new Arc B580 card</a>, the first dedicated GPU based on the new "Battlemage" architecture, launches into the exact same "sub-$300 value-for-money" graphics card segment that the A770 and A750 are already stuck in. But it's a major improvement over those cards in just about every way, and Intel has gone a long way toward fixing drivers and other issues that plagued the first Arc cards at launch. If nothing else, the B580 suggests that Intel has some staying power and that the B700-series GPUs could be genuinely exciting if Intel can get one out relatively soon.</p>

<p>The Arc B580 and Arc B570 lead the charge for the Battlemage generation. Both are based on the same GPU silicon, but the B580 has a few more execution resources, slightly higher clock speeds, a 192-bit memory bus instead of 160-bit, and 12GB of memory instead of 10GB.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Intel positions both cards as entry-level 1440p options because they have a bit more RAM than the 8GB baseline of the GeForce RTX 4060 and Radeon RX 7600. These 8GB cards are still generally fine at 1080p, but more memory does make the Arc cards feel a little more future-proof, especially since they're fast enough to actually hit 60 fps in a lot of games at 1440p.</p>

<p>Our testbed remains largely the same as it has been for a while, though we've swapped the ASRock X670E board for an Asus model. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains the heart of the system, with more than enough performance to avoid bottlenecking midrange and high-end GPUs.</p>
<p>We haven't done extensive re-testing of most older GPUs—the GeForce and Radeon numbers here are the same ones we used in the RX 7600 XT review earlier this year. We wouldn't expect new drivers to change the scores in our games much since they're mostly a bit older—we still use a mix of DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games, including a few with and without ray-tracing effects enabled. We have re-tested the older Arc cards with recent drivers since Intel does still occasionally make changes that can have a noticeable impact on older games.</p>
<p>As with the Arc A-series cards, Intel emphatically recommends that resizable BAR be enabled for your motherboard to get optimal performance. This is sometimes called Smart Access Memory or SAM, depending on your board; most AMD AM4 and 8th-gen Intel Core systems should support it after a BIOS update, and newer PCs should mostly have it on by default. Our test system had it enabled for the B580 and for all the other GPUs we tested.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>


<p>As a competitor to the RTX 4060, the Arc B580 is actually pretty appealing, whether you're talking about 1080p or 1440p, in games with ray-tracing on or off. Even older DirectX 11 titles in our suite, like&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em>, don't seem to take the same performance hit as they did on older Arc cards.</p>
<p>Intel is essentially making a slightly stronger version of the argument that AMD has been trying to make with the RX 7600. AMD's cards always come with the caveat of significantly worse performance in games with heavy ray-tracing effects, but the performance hit for Intel cards in ray-traced games looks a lot more like Nvidia's than AMD's. Playable ray-traced 1080p is well within reach for the Intel card, and in both <em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>, its performance came closer to the 8GB 4060 Ti's.</p>


<p>The 12GB of RAM is also enough to put more space between the B580 and the 8GB versions of the 4060 and 7600.&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em> performs significantly better at 1440p on cards with more memory, like the B580 and the 16GB RX 7600 XT, and it's a safe bet that the 8GB limit will become more of a factor for high-end games at higher resolutions as the years go on.</p>
<p>We experienced just one performance anomaly in our testing. <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> actually runs a bit worse with XeSS enabled, with a smooth average frame rate but frequent stutters that make it less playable overall (though it's worth noting that <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> never benefits much from upscaling algorithms on any GPUs we've tested, for whatever reason). Intel also alerted us to a possible issue with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> when enabling ray-tracing but recommended a workaround that involved pressing F1 to reset the game's settings; the benchmark ran fine on our testbed.</p>

      </figure>

<p>Power consumption is another place where the Battlemage GPU plays a lot of catch-up with Nvidia.&nbsp;<span>With the caveat that software-measured power usage numbers like ours are less accurate than numbers captured with hardware tools, it looks like the B580's power consumption, when fully loaded, consumes somewhere between 120 and 130 W in&nbsp;<em>Hitman</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands</em>.</span>&nbsp;This is a tad higher than the 4060, but it's lower than either Radeon RX 7600.</p>
<p>It's not the top of the class, but looking at the A750's power consumption shows how far Intel has come—the B580 beats the A750's performance every single time while consuming about 60 W less power.</p>

<h2>A strong contender, a late arrival</h2>

<p>Intel is explicitly targeting Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 with the Arc B580, a role it fills well for a low starting price. But the B580 is perhaps more damaging to AMD, which positions both of its 7600-series cards (and the remaining 6600-series stuff that's hanging around) in the same cheaper-than-Nvidia-with-caveats niche.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd probably recommend the B580 to a budget GPU buyer over any of the Radeon RX 7600 cards at this point. For the same street price as the RX 7600, Intel is providing better performance in most games and <em>much</em> better performance in ray-traced games. The 16GB 7600 XT has more RAM, but it's $90 to $100 more expensive, and a 12GB card is still reasonably future-proof and decent at 1440p.</p>
<p>All of that said, Intel is putting out a great competitor to the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 a <em>year and a half&nbsp;</em>after those cards both launched—and within just a few months of a possible RTX 5060. Intel is selling mid-2023's midrange GPU performance in late 2024. There are actually good arguments for building a budget gaming PC right this minute, before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-targets-mexico-and-canada-with-tariffs-plus-an-extra-10-for-china/">potential Trump-administration tariffs</a> can affect prices or supply chains, but assuming the tech industry can maintain its normal patterns, it would be smartest to wait and see what Nvidia does next.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Nvidia also has some important structural benefits. DLSS upscaling support is nearly ubiquitous in high-end games, Nvidia's drivers are more battle-tested, and it's extremely unlikely that Nvidia will decide to pull out of the GPU market and stop driver development any time soon (Intel has published a roadmap encompassing multiple GPU generations, which is reassuring, but the company's recent financial distress has seen it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/alive-after-all-intel-is-handing-its-nuc-mini-pc-business-over-to-asus/">shed</a> several money-losing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/intel-introduced-bitcoin-mining-chips-a-year-ago-and-theyre-already-going-away/">hobby projects</a>).</p>
<p>If there's a saving grace for Intel and the B580, it's that Nvidia has signaled, both through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/do-expensive-nvidia-graphics-cards-foretell-the-death-of-moores-law/">its statements</a> and its behavior, that it's mostly uninterested in aggressively lowering GPU prices, either over time (Nvidia GPUs tend not to stray far from MSRP, barring supply issues) or between generations. An RTX 5060 is highly unlikely to be cheaper than a 4060 and could easily be more expensive. Depending on how good a hypothetical RTX 5060 is, Intel still has a lot of room to offer good performance for the price in a $200-to-$250-ish GPU market that doesn't get a ton of attention.</p>
<p>The other issue for Intel is that for a second straight GPU generation, the company is launching late with a part that is forced by its performance to play in a budget-oriented, low-margin area of the GPU market. I don't think I'm expecting a 4090 or 5090-killer out of Intel any time soon, but based on the B580, I'm at least a little optimistic that Intel can offer a B700-series card that can credibly compete with the likes of Nvidia's 4070-series or AMD's 7800 XT and 7900 GRE. Performance-wise, that's the current sweet spot of the GPU market, but you'll spend more than you would on a PS5 to buy most of those cards. If Intel can shake up that part of the business, it could help put Arc on the map.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solid midrange 1080p and 1440p performance at a good starting price</li>
<li>More RAM than the competition</li>
<li>Much-improved power efficiency compared to Arc A-series GPUs</li>
<li>Unlike the A-series, we noticed no outliers where performance was disproportionately bad</li>
<li>Simple, clean-looking reference design from Intel</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competing with cards that launched a year and a half ago</li>
<li>New Nvidia and AMD competitors are likely within a few months</li>
<li>Intel still can't compete at the high end of the GPU market, or even the medium-high end</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>So far, Arc cards have not been successful enough to guarantee their long-term existence</li>
</ul>

			<p>Lords of the Fallen developer HEXWORKS continues improving the game at a rather impressive rate. After November's big <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.6 update</a> that introduced enhanced exploration of the Umbral realm, balance changes, and PlayStation 5 Pro support (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-runs-max-pc-settings-in-lords-of-the-fallen-says-dev-a-comparable-pc-would-be-more-costly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further detailed in our exclusive interview</a>), the Spanish team has already released a new major update to improve the fluidity of combat thanks to more accurate animation cancellation, improved invincibility frames, more intuitive dodges and rolls, serious attack button prompts, general stamina balancing, and more.</p>
<p>These latest enhancements are meant to make players feel more in control when playing Lords of the Fallen, especially in combat. In the vision of the developer, they also help lower the entry barrier for new players while raising the skill ceiling for more experienced players. Version 1.7 also includes several quality-of-life updates, such as the ability to toggle automatic Vigor collection (first added in November's v1.6 update), more realistic enemy attack ranges and tracking for more immersive encounters, and further balancing the New Game Plus experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, newcomers will now get the ability to summon NPCs to assist in boss battles before the first encounter (previously, this could only be done after the first defeat). HEXWORKS has tweaked their stats to make them more viable allies in combat. Version 1.7 also sees the addition of a fan-favorite character, the Hallowed Sentinel Hound (also known as 'Good Boy'), as a new summonable NPC for boss encounters.</p>
