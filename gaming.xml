			<p>NVIDIA has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds is now available to play via the GeForce NOW cloud. CAPCOM's new game recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> sales records (over eight million units in just three days), and now it'll open up to a new audience, allowing even those without a powerful PC or console to join the hunt via the GeForce NOW app on any PC, Shield TV devices, Mac, and compatible TVs and smartphones.</p>
<p>It's a big week overall for GeForce NOW users, who also get support for the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game FragPunk and Hazelight's latest title, Split Fiction. The latter game earned an 8 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Birch's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, NVIDIA's cloud platform also supports the newly launched action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished. The game developed by Eko Software is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863430/Dragonkin_The_Banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out now in early access</a> and you can read Francesco De Meo's thoughts <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</em></p>
<p>The weekly GeForce NOW roundup also includes the following previously released games which, however, are now supported on other stores:</p>
<p>● Ghostrunner 2 (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Prey (Epic Games Store, Steam, and Xbox available on PC Game Pass)</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed.1126836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake developer Ballistic Moon has reportedly been "effectively closed", with only a handful of employees remaining at the studio.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, which cites "multiple sources with knowledge of the situation", the remaining staff at Ballistic Moon were let go in December. Those layoffs followed staff reductions back in September, just before the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date" rel="nofollow">October release</a>.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming's sources say that around 40 staff were let go in September, and that about 20 more lost their jobs in December, with only the studio's founders and "possibly" a few more employees remaining at Ballistic Moon. No developers, marketing execs, or PR folks are still there, apparently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=mrDN0JH6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=XG57tRiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake Ballistic Moon has apparently effectively ceased to exist.</figcaption></figure><p>Ballistic Moon's gutting effectively means that the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake has nobody working on patches or updates; a source told Insider Gaming that people were "sharing bugs" to make Ballistic Moon aware of them, but that "there is no one working on patch support".</p>

<p>Apparently, Ballistic Moon's owners attempted to keep the ball rolling with regards to further support for&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, but Sony wasn't interested. Sources also told Insider Gaming that Ballistic Moon's owners were looking for new publishers for other projects, but they weren't successful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it probably isn't a surprise that Ballistic Moon is in its current position. Reportedly,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord" rel="nofollow">debuted to a lower PS5 player count</a> than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">doomed shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>, and its Steam player count peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2172010/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">just over 2,600 players</a> isn't particularly noteworthy either.</p>

<p>Given that Sony currently seems to be in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">middle</a> of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">rethink</a> when it comes to its gaming operations, studios like Ballistic Moon are unfortunately likely to be the first in the gaming giant's firing line.</p>




<p>Of course, with respect to Ballistic Moon, I'd question the necessity of remaking&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>in the first place. The original's not particularly old, and it seems to me that a remaster along the lines of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>'s</a> would have worked just as well.</p>

<p>In any case, if you do want to see the fruits of Ballistic Moon's labor, the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/until-dawn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and you can read our Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

In fact, you might have to go back to 2002’s <em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind </em>to find another first-person fantasy role-playing game that so utterly captivated me with its world. I’ve seen some people grouse that it’s not as full-featured as the likes of <em>Skyrim</em>, but I actually <em>like </em>that about it! Developer Obsidian knew what it wanted to achieve with this game and focused its resources where they mattered most: on creating a world that’s fun and rewarding to explore; on developing combat that’s hard-hitting and offers all kinds of player agency; and on a narrative that has deeply developed themes, expressive choices, and the potential to experience significant consequences. I didn’t realize just how significant until I failed to prevent a catastrophe in the game’s second area, and you know what? I’m glad I made this huge mistake. Let me explain. <strong>(Spoilers concerning the second area of</strong><em><strong> Avowed</strong></em><strong> follow.)</strong><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-recommend-id="image://fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-format="png" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="SPOILER WARNING" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-recommend-id="image://fb7b50392737f5feec14495c777be571" data-format="png" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="SPOILER WARNING" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Avowed</em>’s setting of the Living Lands<em> </em>is divided into five regions, or so I’ve been told. I’m still only in the third, as I’m really savoring my time with the game and trying to explore each area as thoroughly as possible before I move on to the next. In the second region, the captivating fungal forest known as the Emerald Stair, you visit the town of Fior mes Ivèrno. It’s no bustling metropolis or industrial capital but it’s a lovely settlement, one that clearly means a great deal to its residents who, in some cases, have roots there that go back generations. Your adventures in the region bring you into contact with many of them, including its mayor and a headstrong animancer who joins forces with you as you seek a way to cure the strange ailment plaguing the Living Lands and its people.</p><p>It’s also in this realm that a force known as the Steel Garrote comes into sharper focus. A military force which you might—I suppose—initially find guilty of nothing more than being coldly pragmatic in its approach to crisis management, here reveals itself to be genuinely ruthless. You can find this out in a few ways. I learned it in the most devastating way possible.</p><p>See, as I resolved a side quest in the Emerald Stair, a character told me that the Steel Garrote had an encampment nearby. She said something about them being in a cave behind a waterfall. My companion Kai even turned to me at this moment and said something like, “We should look into that.” I enthusiastically agreed, suspecting that the Steel Garrote were up to no good. The only problem is that I was only half paying attention to this NPC’s comments, and didn’t catch exactly <em>where </em>she said this cave behind a waterfall was. Oh well, I thought. I’ll just file that away in the back of my mind and look for caves behind each and every waterfall I come across in this region. I’m sure I’ll stumble upon it eventually.</p><figure id="" data-id="da1af9f488045c6d447ae26aae5c7d48" data-recommend-id="image://da1af9f488045c6d447ae26aae5c7d48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young woman speaks in front of a number of lit candles.

But I typically don’t look up things about games unless I’m completely stuck. I prefer to keep my experiences with games as organic as possible, and would much rather miss big things and fumble my way through a game than find everything and absolutely wipe the floor with enemies because I looked up a walkthrough or some game-breaking combat tips. That’s not to say I think people who do rely on walkthroughs are “doing it wrong,”—far from it. I think everyone should play games in the way that’s most enjoyable for them. For me, that’s just doing my best with little to no help or guidance and letting the chips fall where they may. Often, I’ll look up secrets <em>after </em>I’ve finished a game to find out about all the cool stuff I missed, but especially with a game like <em>Avowed</em>, in which so much of the joy for me comes from exploration and discovery, I try to hold off until then.</p><p>So I kept exploring the Emerald Stair, taking care of bounties and side quests, but never finding this cave in which the Steel Garrote were apparently hiding out. Finally, I tackled a main story mission that had my party delve into an ancient structure in the region, and just as we seemed to be wrapping things up there, the voice in my character’s head (whose identity I won’t reveal but who is connected to the land in some profound way) began to shriek in anguish and despair; it was clear that something was terribly wrong. Emerging from the depths and into the night, I could immediately see what had happened: there, on a distant hillside, Fior mes Ivèrno was burning!</p><p>As we ran to look for survivors, we encountered bands of Steel Garrote members trying to keep us from the vicinity, and I immediately knew those bastards were responsible. Worse, it was only then, by some cruel twist of fate, that I stumbled upon the cave where the Steel Garrote had been hiding, though now they were gone, and the only occupants of the cave were a group of xaurips that had moved in. As I explored, it became clear that if I’d only found the cave sooner and dealt with the Steel Garrote then, I could have saved Fior mes Ivèrno. It doesn’t have to burn. Maybe, for you, it didn’t, or it won’t. But for me, it did. And while of course I’m not “glad” that the town’s residents lost their home, I’m glad that as a player, I didn’t know what was coming, and that I failed to prevent it. It adds some delicious texture to my sense of my own character, and to my hatred of the Steel Garrote.</p><figure id="" data-id="0b5f4c985b675ccabdfe493c578cb961" data-recommend-id="image://0b5f4c985b675ccabdfe493c578cb961" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta is shown saying &quot;I will not forget Fior mes Iverno.

However, it doesn’t take long for you to start meeting people who, with good reason, don’t take too kindly to the idea of the Living Lands effectively becoming a colony of Aedyr. I wanted to role-play my own envoy as someone who came to the Living Lands with an open mind, but who eventually finds herself swayed to help the local people in whatever way she can, even if it means betraying her emperor and her orders.</p><p>The Steel Garrote are not officially representatives of the Aedyran empire, but they do seem to be broadly aligned with Aedyr in their goals of conquering or taming the Lands. And because they burned Fior mes Ivèrno, I’ve now gone from being suspicious of the Steel Garrote, to outright hating them, and it’s awesome. I love to hate these fuckers. It feels so good to see them in the world and take them out without hesitation or remorse. I haven’t relished fighting a particular enemy faction this much since the terrific writing in <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order </em>drove home that the Empire are irredeemable space-fascists who you should force-push off a cliff at every opportunity. I’m sure I’d still enjoy fighting the Steel Garrote if they hadn’t burned Fior mes Ivèrno, but the fact that they committed such an atrocity makes fighting them all the sweeter.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc7e1f026899e5a4b3a9ead389fd2e0f" data-recommend-id="image://dc7e1f026899e5a4b3a9ead389fd2e0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman in paladin-style armor named Captain Carnet says &quot;I have no reason to care what Fior thinks of us.

I don’t know where my character’s journey will end, but now she’s got one haunting tragedy in her past, one colossal failure to keep her up at night. For me, that’s a fascinating part of her story, one that drives her all the more to prevent any more innocents in the Living Lands from suffering needlessly at the hands of colonizers and tyrants. Did I mention I love this game?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-hidden-variable-autumn-games-legal-dispute<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>developer Hidden Variable has announced it will cease all work on the franchise owing to an ongoing legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiddenvariable.com/post/3ljotvjtpnk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/hidden-variable-ceases-development-on-skullgirls-ip-payment-dispute-publisher-autumn-games-seemingly-owes-1-2-million-to-hidden-variable.1126731/#post-136658811" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dgamemaster</a>), Hidden Variable says it is "no longer involved" in developing any&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>game, including&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls 2nd Encore</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls Mobile</em>, and "other&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>IP-related efforts".</p>

<p>The studio says it's in the middle of a dispute with Autumn Games which has been escalated to "litigation filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court", and that it won't be providing further comment on the matter until said issue is resolved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=ipJVsscE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=l5GLWkQ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>studio Hidden Variable is embroiled in a legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Hidden Variable says it won't be commenting on the matter, dgamemaster sought out the <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/240911937/complaint" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">legal document</a> filed by the studio, and it looks as though the dispute comes down to missed payments.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hidden Variable appears to be alleging that Autumn Games failed to pay it a number of times between November and now, with payments amounting to $1.23m due to Hidden Variable on Autumn Games' behalf.</p>

<p>The developer says Autumn's actions were intentional, and that the publisher was intending to find a new developer for the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>games after it "unsuccessfully sought to sell its business".&nbsp;Ouch.</p>

<p>According to dgamemaster's post, Autumn Games has said that it intends to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>despite the dispute, but it hasn't specified which of the games it will be updating, nor when new updates will be made available.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=r2hSSRn3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=XiFBQ8T7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>might still get updates, although we don't know when.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>has run into a spot of bother. Back in 2020, Autumn Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-publisher-kicks-lab-zero-games-off-project" rel="nofollow">kicked original developer Lab Zero off the IP</a>&nbsp;following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/More-Victimized-Employees-Leave-Lab-Zero-Mike-Z" rel="nofollow">allegations made against that studio's head Mike Zaimont</a>.</p>

<p>Following those allegations, Zaimont subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-z-lays-off-all-remaining-lab-zero-games-employees" rel="nofollow">laid off all remaining Lab Zero employees</a>, with former staff going on to create a new studio by the name of Future Club. That studio would then work on&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/former-lab-zero-devs-partner-with-hidden-variable-for-skullgirls-content" rel="nofollow">DLC</a>, thus completing the cycle.</p>

<p>The future of the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently unclear, although it sounds like Autumn Games intends to continue working on at least one of the games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> might release at Christmas according to Khary Payton, who voices the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a> in the upcoming World War 2-set action game. It's the first morsel of release info we've garnered for Rise Of Hydra since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">announcement last March</a>, which tantalised with the prospect of playing USO Show-era Steve Rogers and Azzuri, great-grandfather to the current Black Panther.
</p>
<p>
In the works at Skydance New Media alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amy-hennig-is-making-a-new-star-wars-game-again">an untitled Star Wars game</a>, Rise Of Hydra had been slated to launch in 2025. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Payton suggested that it might be a holiday release, landing after Call Of Duty season and just in time for the nostalgic yuletide period. "We're still working," he hummed and hypothesised. "We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." 
</p>
<p>
I'm not wildly keen myself to play another Marvel game. The expanded Marvel universe as it stands is a kaleidoscopic hangover following the success of the Avengers movies, with no clear heir to the throne just yet. Nor am I especially happy to be back in the shoes of OG Steve Rogers, a recruitment poster character rescued from his own can-do heroism by Chris Evans knowing how to do comedy. Yeah, you comicbook readers probably have a more nuanced take on Marvel's current activities. By all means come at me.
</p>
<p>
I'll forgive Rise Of Hydra all that, though, because Skydance New Media's president is former Naughty Dog creative director Amy Hennig, and she directed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. I will forgive Amy Hennig anything, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to brain me with a vase, filch my debit card and blow my life savings on Fantastic Four figurines, I would tell the police not to stress about it, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to tunnel back through time and humiliate me elaborately by inviting my favourite Sonic The Comic artist to come see me fall into a cauldron of stale baked beans while being rejected by my primary school sweetheart, I would sob gratefully in the knowledge that one day, Amy Hennig is going to direct Soul Reaver. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps she will even work on another Soul Reaver game, if we can only get her through the Marvel period in her career.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8-biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025.1126806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The horror game market continues to thrive and 2025’s schedule is lining up a multi-course meal of fear-inducing, hair-reducing cowering and crying. 2025 has a myriad of big horror games from well-known sequels to potential breakout hits.</p>



<p>I find horror in games makes films look like child’s play—and I don’t mean any dangerous dolls. A movie forces you to watch what happens, whereas in a game, <em>you </em>are responsible for the action unfolding. <em>You </em>have to push your character along, advance the narrative, and trigger jumpscares and premeditated psychological horror.</p>



<p>It’s daunting when you think about it, yet players can’t get enough. To appease the morbid curiosity in all of us, here’s a list of the biggest upcoming horror games in 2025, sure to scare and scar you one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-horror-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Horror Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Many of these 2025 horror game release dates could be subject to change.</strong> The volatility of the game industry and sudden technical problems means any title is a delay away from a 2026 or 2027 release date. That being said, let’s get into it.</p>



<h3 id="h-directive-8020">Directive 8020</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unsettling. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Supermassive Games is one of the pioneers of the horror genre in the last 15 years. The acclaimed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-teaser-released-ahead-of-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a> kickstarted this Hall of Fame-worthy horror march. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/directive-8020-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Directive 8020</a> is the latest in The Dark Pictures Anthology—featuring The Quarry, Little Hope, and others—and features the series’ trademarks. Expect to tackle sudden quick-time events and critical story-changing decisions while you explore the unknown of the Cassiopeia.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’re ready for more mutations. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light The Beast</a> brings back OG protagonist Kyle Crane as we embark on another adventure of parkour and parasitical purgatory. The Beast is a separate sequel from Dying Light 2, and <a href="https://techland.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Techland</a> is looking to bring together a more compact and equally chaotic experience. As before, Dying Light The Beast’s world is a terrifying ordeal during the day and almost unsurvivable at night. You’ll need to unlock the beast within to help Crane rise high.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Can’t we be friends? Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Imagine Call of Duty Zombies’ renowned round-based gameplay, but with even faster, more vicious, and grotesque enemies. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is the meaner and nastier undead sibling in the zombies family and builds on Killing Floor 2’s good work. The M.E.A.T system is back to delight and disgust, and the new Zed design is likely to put you off your tea—sick bags on stand by.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Phew, someone by my side. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>2025 is proving to be a big year for Supermassive Games as the developer is pulling double duty. Developer Tarsier Studios has moved onto pastures new, and someone needed to pick up the remnants of the beloved franchise. In steps Supermassive Games to deliver <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-platforms-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> and bring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-little-nightmares-3-multiplayer-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op multiplayer</a> in a series first. We have a new developer, new main characters in Low and Alone, and reasons to be thankful and fearful.</p>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Excited for this one. Credit to Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>We segue nicely to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—the new IP from Little Nightmares 1 and 2 developer Tarsier Studios. Even from the screenshot above you can see an uncanny resemblance and deliberate inspiration for the horror title. Unsurprisingly, you need to solve puzzles, escape and avoid unspeakable enemies, and it also includes co-operative play in case you need to squeeze the hand of the person next to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been long enough. Credit to Undead Labs</figcaption></figure>



<p>Full disclosure: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Decay 3</a> MIGHT not be releasing in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s currently the only entry on this list in serious jeopardy of this deadline. A potential delay to 2026 or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027</a> is on the cards, so bear this in mind, but no one truly knows. If it releases in 2025, developer Undead Labs has likely put all its infected blood, sweat, and tears into it. There’s a healthy development cycle between each State of Decay release, and the 2024 Xbox Showcase footage we saw of State of Decay 3 heightens survival, and the game demands your time, respect, and attention. </p>



<h3 id="h-the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Got a light? Credit to MoonHood</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just looking at The Midnight Walk makes me anxious. It’s ingenious, stop-motion clay-orientated horror works so well because it’s seldom seen. Its art styles alone make me want to play it. If you dare to jump into The Midnight Walk, you’ll need to do more than walk around to survive the antagonistic threat of monsters.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Why do I even bother? Credit to Frogwares</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Sinking City 2 is a sequel and another special loveletter to Lovecraftian themes. Unlike escape and survival, like many entries on our best and biggest horror games 2025 list, you can attack in The Sinking City 2. But you also need to venture into the deepest recesses of your brain to engage your deductive reasoning senses. The sequel builds upon the original’s detective mechanics, and happens to throw a 200ft monster or two at you in the process. Sherlock Holmes didn’t have to deal with this!</p>

Capcom has announced the Event Quest schedule for Monster Hunter Wilds, which gives players a chance to earn exclusive gear.</p><p>The Event Quests are somewhat similar to live-service content in other games, but the key difference is that Capcom isn't charging players to take part in these limited-time events.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/samsung-shows-off-foldable-handheld-thats-basically-a-switch-you-can-bend-in-half<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Technology giant Samsung has shown off a working concept for a foldable gaming handheld - and it's essentially a Nintendo Switch that you can bend in half. 
</p>
<p>
Ever tried to snap your Switch in rage? Well, now you can do that with the Samsung Flex Gaming concept and (hopefully) not break the device in the process.
</p>
<p>
While just a concept, Samsung had workable units on show at the MWC mobile technology event in Barcelona this week, with foldable OLED screens up and running. Just ignore the big crease down the middle.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
Perhaps just as notable, the Samsung Flex Gaming concept also includes two giant holes in each of its not-Joy-Con. These are designed to allow the control stick in each side of the handheld to fit snugly inside the other half.
</p>
<p>
Cleverly, the face button and D-Pad have been built into the edges of each hole - again replicating the placement of these buttons on Nintendo Switch.
</p>
<p>
The device even has different colours for each half, as the original Switch had for its model with Blue/Red Joy-Con. Samsung's choices are lime green and yellow though - not as attractive, though very Norwich City FC.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is expected to not offer an OLED screen in its upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> (or allow you to bend it in half). The Mario maker is set to unveil more details of its next handheld in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">special Nintendo Direct presentation scheduled for 2nd April</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sometimes, it's really hard to let some things go, even for a legendary game creator such as Hideki Kamiya, who seems to have some trouble forgetting the <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/">canceled Xbox exclusive Scalebound.</a></p>
<p>In a new studio update video from Clovers, Kamiya-san's new development studio, which is currently working on an Okami sequel in collaboration with CAPCOM, the creator of the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta series, among other excellent action games, was shown reminiscing about Scalebound while looking at footage and trailers shared online back when the game was still in active development. Despite the project having been canceled eight years ago, it still holds an important place in Kamiya-san's heart, as he would love to make it again someday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Let’s do it, Phil ! 😀 <a href="https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt">https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt</a></p>
<p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1896473842950041682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Microsoft seems interested in resuming old partnerships with Japanese development studios, as shown earlier this year with the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4 and the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, there could be some interest from the publisher in working together with Hideki Kamiya's new studio for another project which could incorporate some of the features that the legendary creator liked so much in Scalebound. Since the project has only been briefly mentioned a couple of times since its cancelation, and not in <a href="https://wccftech.com/scalebound-rough-development-missed-milestones-stopped-payments-kamiya-takes-time-health/">the best of lights</a>, however, it definitely feels like that ship has sailed, never to come back.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, Hideki Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, is working on a new entry in the Okami series in collaboration with CAPCOM. The game, which will be released on PC and consoles on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date, will be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">RE Engine</a>, which is allowing the studio to fully realize Kamiya-san's vision.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-update-brings-new-clone-rumble-mode-and-more.1126779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-update-clone-rumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released a new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing a chaotic new game mode along with it, as well as a new Galacta-themed event and plenty of balance changes.</p>

<p>The update was released earlier today, but two of its biggest additions won't be going live until tomorrow: the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event and the Clone Rumble game mode.</p>

<p>First up, Clone Rumble is a new mode that allows you and your teammates all to play as the same hero. If you've ever wondered what six Mr. Fantastics or six Rocket Raccoons could accomplish in a <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>match, this mode is for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=Ux31xIdJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=V38OQTBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new Clone Rumble update looks set to cause chaos.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will only be available across three distinct three-day time periods, though. You'll be able to check it out between tomorrow and March 10th, and it'll then be available again from March 14th-March 17th and March 21st-March 24th.</p>

<p>As well as Clone Rumble, you can also check out the new Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, which launches tomorrow as well. Joining the event will net you an exclusive Black Widow outfit for free, and this event runs until April 11th, so the time period isn't as limited as Clone Rumble.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect plenty of optimizations and gameplay tweaks in this update. It's well worth checking out the full&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Clone Rumble update so you can stay up-to-date on what's going on.</p>




<p>It's been a strange few months for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The game launched back in December and reached <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million registered players</a> within just 72 hours, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">break the 40 million barrier</a> by NetEase's last count.</p>

<p>However, that didn't stop the Chinese gaming giant from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">unexpectedly closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing the game. I guess nobody is really safe from the recent wave of industry cuts and layoffs, unfortunately.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010451" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>
Xbox owners enrolled into the Xbox Insider program are reporting that their consoles are being reset back to factory settings by a new update.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Insider program allows users to receive new system features early, and is split into various 'tiers' for how new and/or buggy they want these features to be when they receive them. 
</p>
<p>
Users in the earliest Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers say the latest console update is removing their Xbox profiles, console settings and Quick Resume data (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-latest-system-update-for-xbox-insiders-is-removing-their-user-profiles/">VGC</a>) - and has now been made a mandatory download, so cannot be skipped.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Insider program has been running for 15 years, but an issue this big is extremely rare. The scheme's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/">dedicated reddit is awash with complaints</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/serious_preview_update_bug_factory_reset/">one user calling it</a> the "biggest bug I've ever seen release in all my years of being in the preview program".
</p>
<p>"This one actually factory reset my Series X," another user wrote. "It must've updated today and now my console is requiring me to set it up as brand new."
</p>
<p>"Light a candle for the guy here with a broken HDMI port and relies on remote play," wrote another. "Update messed everything up and now I cannot remote to my Series X, can't even see what is going on."</p>
<p>
While users can re-sign into their profiles and manually change back their settings, anyone impacted will lose time (and need to remember their passwords, including to any media apps).
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You can now lease a PS5, along with the likes of a PS VR2 set and Sony's handheld remote player PlayStation Portal, here in the UK.</p>
<p>This leasing service debuted in Japan, and quickly became a hit. As Ed reported this morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">GEO's PS5 rental service in Japan is fully booked across its 400 stores nationwide</a>. It's been a monster (hunter) success, you could say.</p>
<p>And now, it is our turn. Sony's <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing">PS Direct UK website</a> lets you rent a digital-only PS5 for £11/month, or a PS5 with a disc drive for £12/month. Stump up £19/month and you can rent a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. If you want a PS VR2, it's £18.50/month - or £20/month if you want access to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-call-mountain">Horizon: Call of the Mountain</a> too. PlayStation Portal is £6.50/month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those interested in going down the lease route can choose a 12, 24, or 36-month term contract, although there is also a rolling monthly option if that's more your thing. As for the products available through the service, you will be able to rent the following PlayStation items:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro Console</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Console (model group - slim)</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console - Two DualSense Wireless Controllers Bundle (model group - slim)</li>

<li>PlayStation Portal Remote Player</li>
<li>PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</li>
<li>PlayStation VR2</li>
<li>DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/support/leasing">FAQ section on the website</a>, Sony states all lease agreements are made exclusively with Raylo. "All transactions, communications, and support services related to your device lease will be provided directly by Raylo," the page reads. "If you've signed up to a lease through PlayStation leasing and you have any issues with your device or your lease, you should contact Raylo for support in the first instance."</p>
<p>It also states Raylo offers a fair wear and tear policy on the leased hardware.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Raylo offer a fair wear and tear policy," Sony states. "It's ok to return your device with obvious signs of use such as a couple of deep scratches, small dents, discolouration or changes in the paintwork."</p>
<p>So, are you tempted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-making-rare-creature-previously-locked-to-city-events-available-to-all<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has now announced official details for this summer's Go Fest event series, which will include the global release of a Pokémon previously locked behind paid City Safari meetups.
</p>
<p>
As detailed previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">Go Fest 2025 will hold in-person events in Paris, Jersey City and Osaka</a> through late May and June. These will lead to the game's global Go Fest, which is now confirmed to take place on 28th and 29th June.
</p>
<p>
Today, Niantic confirmed Go Fest this year will see the release of Crowned Sword Zacian and Crowned Shield Zamazenta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-next-mythical-pokemon-teased-in-go-fest-logo">which players had deduced from this year's leaked Go Fest logo</a>. In a surprise, the event's main Mythical creature will be Volcanion, however - not Megearna as previously suspected. 
</p>
<p>
And in another surprise, it's been confirmed that Pokémon Go Fest Global will include the wider release of Skiddo, the cute goat creature you'd previously need to travel to City Safari event to capture. 
</p>
<p>
Through 2023 and 2024, Skiddo was only available if you visited Seoul, Barcelona, Mexico City, Tainan, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo at specific times. 
</p>
<p>
2025's City Safari events - so far confirmed for Milan, Singapore and Mumbai - now feature donkey Pokémon Mudbray as their new exclusive, signalling a wider release for Skiddo was on the cards.
</p>
<p>
This year may well include other changes to Pokémon Go, depending on the outcome of the game's reported sale. Last month, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Niantic was planning to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a> - a move which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">stoked concern amongst players due to Scopely's aggressive monetisation strategy</a> seen after it has taken over other mobile games.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.
</p>
<p>
Epic is seeking unspecified damages from Illinois Fortnite fan Isaac "i5aac" Strock for fraud, copyright infringement and unjust enrichment.
</p>
<p>
Strock is named in a <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2025-02-27-epic-v--strock-complaint-5a69b553b2a2.pdf">legal filing dated 27th February</a>, which <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025">Epic Games has also publicised via a recent blog post</a> - its latest move to name and shame those who target Fortnite with unscrupulous practices.
</p>
<p>
"Strock is in the business of stealing access to other players' Epic Games accounts," Epic Games wrote in its court filing. 
</p>
<p>
"He uses illicit means to discover the players' usernames and passwords and in some cases even the login credentials for the players' email address associated with the players' Epic Games account. He then sells access to these accounts to the highest bidders."
</p>
<p>
Epic Games estimates Strock has sold "hundreds" of player accounts and says he has boasted online about reaping "thousands of dollars in profits".
</p>
<p>
Strock is said to have even offered a guide on how to cheat Epic Games' player support and steal more accounts - again, for a price. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games detected Strock on multiple occasions trying to bamboozle its player support with requests to change log-in details and gain access to accounts with valuable cosmetics or that had already been pre-loaded with Fortnite in-game currency.
</p>
<p>
Strock also used email and password combinations acquired in data breaches via the dark web to further add to his stolen account haul, the legal filing states.
</p>
<p>
The online trade in Fortnite accounts is lucrative, and accounts with rare skins are highly prized. Epic Games notes that some individual accounts sell for over $1000 each.
</p>
<p>
"Strock's actions harm Epic and the Fortnite community," the company concluded. "Epic has spent substantial resources investigating and working to prevent Strock's conduct. Strock's conduct also directly harms Fortnite players who no longer have access to the accounts they spent time and money on.
</p>
<p>
"Epic is entitled to all remedies available at law or equity, including injunctive relief, compensatory damages and/or other equitable or monetary remedies."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Epic Games announced its victory against a Fortnite competitive cheater who had tried to sneak their way into the game's biggest tournament</a>. Epic took back the player's winnings, forced them to post humiliating public apology video and then donated the prize money to charity.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mod-addresses-stuttering-issues-caused-by-anti-tamper-tech.1126728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Many of the Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues on PC may have become a thing of the past, thanks to a new version of a popular mod available for all games powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, modder Praydog released a new version of the REFramework mod, which significantly reduces the micro-stuttering issues caused by the game's anti-tamper tech by preventing constant scanning. The mod also addresses some crashing issues caused by DRM as well. You can find this new version of the mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, but if you're having issues with it like other users are reporting, you can use any of the previous nightly builds available on <a href="https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> that seem to be more stable as of now.</p>
<p>Performance issues aren't the only issues that impact the Monster Hunter Wilds experience, as the low challenge level for the story and a good portion of the postgame High Rank can be a little offputting for those who mastered previous generation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. Thankfully, some mods are already available to address the low challenge level of the game, allowing hunters to<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/"> increase both monsters' health and attack power.</a></p>
<p>The above issues aside, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly among the finest entries in the series. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <p>One of Japan's biggest retailers began offering a PS5 rental service last week, but it's already fully booked thanks in large part to the popularity of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>GEO began offering the service on 28th February, neatly timed with the release of Capcom's latest monster hunting game. It's surprisingly cheap too, with a week's rental at around a fiver and two weeks for under a tenner.</p>
<p>However, the availability is completely blocked out until mid-April across all regions, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/">Automaton</a> reported.

<p>Japanese players are notorious for maintaining the quality of their gaming tech, but I'm not convinced a similar service would work here in the UK. Too many sticky controllers.</p>
<p>GEO hasn't stated how many consoles are available for rental, but the service is being provided across its 400 stores nationwide - the fact it's booked up proves the service (and Monster Hunter Wilds) are extremely popular.</p>
<p>In fact, it's yet another example of the impact Capcom's game is having over in Japan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">cheese naan sales are on the rise thanks to Monster Hunter Wilds' delectable food scenes</a>.</p>
<p>One Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant thanked Monster Hunter directly for boosting its cheese naan sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds reached the highest concurrent player numbers on Steam for the series</a>, quickly reaching over 1.3 million players just a couple of days after launch. That's over four times higher than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, which reached more than 300,000 concurrent players.</p>
<p>Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds is Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>, reaching over 8m units sold in just three days across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"The most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter yet, even if its attempts to balance the old and new don't always quite coalesce in its ongoing quest to please all audiences," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The unconfirmed but widely reported on Gears of War Collection is expected to be revealed Xbox Direct but ahead of that we may have some bad news as it seems like the pack will include co-op, but not multiplayer.</p>
<p>This all started yesterday when a Twitter user <a href="https://xcancel.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1897091375457542358">Detective Seeds</a> posted “Gears of War collection should be releasing early to mid August. It is PS5 pro enhanced, but I have been told NO Multiplayer PVP, campaign focus only.” He then added “For further on Gears of War collection. The game is loaded onto PS storefront on the back end (this is the same with others I have said in the past). It shows 1 player and does not show support for additional players. I asked about co-op, but no clarification on that yet.”</p>


<p>As Detective Seeds has a relatively small Twitter following and no track record, this claim was widely dismissed. However, the following day, Window Central’s Jez Corden became aware of the claim and backed it up: “I too have heard no multiplayer.&nbsp;I’m not sure why they did it this way.”</p>
<p>As&nbsp; the posts suggest, we are expecting Gears of War to arrive on PlayStation for the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/"> first time ever</a>, and with Forza arriving this April that just leaves Halo as the last big Microsoft exclusive to make the jump.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there are rumours that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">Gears of War E-Day</a> is now scheduled for 2026.</p>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth patch is now live on PC, introducing a fix for an AMD Radeon GPUs-specific issue and some improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.00.3 patch, which is around 18.3 GB big for the Steam version of the game, introduces game stability improvements, fixing several unspecified bugs. The new patch also fixes an issue that caused crashes while playing the game using certain AMD Radeon GPUs and reduces the package size when downloading on Steam Deck, which is a great improvement for those who have limited storage space on their systems. Unfortunately, this seems to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/527588008025654786?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything the patch does</a>, so it's yet another minor patch that doesn't address the performance issue that many are experiencing.</p>
<p>Considering how the main development team seems to have fully moved on to the development of the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, it's not surprising to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth not getting any new features. Thankfully, modders have come to the rescue once again, adding features not available in the vanilla game, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special menu</a> that allows quick editing of the combat party and even adding Vincent and Cid to the party, although the two characters are not playable.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn Remake</a> players are still sharing bug reports with UK developer Ballistic Moon, but there's apparently no one left to respond. “The studio has effectively closed now," one anonymous source told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>An undisclosed number of layoffs were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">publicly announced last September</a>, shortly before the Until Dawn remake's launch in October. According to IG's source, these amounted to "roughly 40 employees". "Around 20" developers were allegedly kept on for post-launch support until they themselves were laid off last December, leaving a handful of employees "at most" alongside studio founders. "There are no employees in public relations, marketing, or development left."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ballistic Moon were reportedly unsuccessful in their attempts to secure funding or publishers for new projects, despite pitches. New Until Dawn projects with publisher Sony were reportedly "discussed but never came to fruition". That's despite actors Peter Stomare and Hayden Panettiere both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-actors-hint-at-a-sequel-but-theres-reason-to-be-sceptical">making possible hints toward a sequel last year</a>. Original Until Dawn creators Supermassive - who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">went through a round of cuts last January</a> - have yet to make any announcements.</p>
<p>"Most who spoke said that it was a generally good place to work," write IG, although one of their sources claims that the layoffs followed overtime, and “weeks” of unpaid development work. “Nice reward for our hard work,” they said.</p>
<p>Ahem. Pay your workers. Pay your fucking workers. It's better that no-one does overtime but if they do, pay your fucking workers and pay them well. If you don't pay your workers, you shouldn't ever be allowed to be in a position of power as long as you live. Pay your workers. It would be better if nobody got laid off but if it happens, make sure you've paid your workers. Pay your fucking workers. Pay them. If you don't pay your workers they should be legally allowed to climb in through your window at dinner time and eat the chicken off your plate every night until they've eaten enough chicken to settle the debt. Pay your workers.</p>
<p>Sony and Ballistic Moon have yet to comment on IG's report. We've reached out for comment ourselves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Minecraft developer Mojang has announced a new Minecraft Live event, to be held on 22nd March at 6pm UK time, and teased that it will contain "new game drops".
</p>
<p>
Does this mean new "drops" in existing Minecraft games, or the dropping of new Minecraft games entirely? The event's brief teaser video does not say.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, however, the teaser does note that "exclusive movie content" is also on the way, separate to the ambiguous dropping mentioned above.

Mojang's Minecraft Movie tie-in is likely the A Minecraft Movie Hero Pack which leaked online last week. It contains character skins for the upcoming film's main roster - including a beardy Jack Black as Steve, and Aquaman in a pink jacket.

At <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-live-digital-showcase-returns-later-this-month-with-news-about-our-games-and-more">the last Minecraft Live, in September 2024</a>, Mojang announced it was ditching its singular big summer update for multiple updates spread throughout the year. The next of these, presumably, will be revealed later this month.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/295k-minecraft-fans-criticise-lack-of-new-content-in-stop-the-mob-vote-petition">Minecraft Live has also now ditched its long-running mob vote</a>, after the process for voting on new creatures became too controversial, and some fans complained about their choices getting sidelined. Democracy!

In case you missed it, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-final-movie-trailer-is-more-of-the-same-but-at-least-jennifer-coolidge-is-in-it">Minecraft film's final trailer arrived last week and features Jennifer Coolidge being Jennifer Coolidge</a>, which is something to recommend about this movie at least. The film itself is out on 4th April.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character.1126701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The fourth season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation is on its way, and we've now got word of a new character for the show. That's not <em>too </em>exciting in itself, but this particular addition to the show marks a notable change. You see, this is the Netflix series' first game-exclusive character to pop up on the small screen.</p>
<p>Since its conception, Netflix's Witcher team has refrained from adapting anything particularly game-specific, sticking instead with characters and beasties based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novels and short stories. Of course, there has been the occasional reference back to CDPR's own Sapkowski-based works, such as Henry Cavill's Geralt taking a nice, steamy bath (see header image above).</p>
<p>That's changing for the show's fourth season, however, with the reported addition of actor Jack Myers. According to Witcher fan site <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/03/01/netflixs-the-witcher-casts-its-first-character-from-the-games/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, Myers - who has starred in the likes of The Crown and Call the Midwife, as well as lending his vocal talents to games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dying Light 2 - has landed the role of Roderick de Wett, a character from the original Witcher game.</p>

<p>Now, if you haven't heard of Roderick de Wett, don't worry - he didn't exactly have a huge role in the first Witcher. He was a Nilfgaardian Count, and member of the religious knightly order known as The Order of the Flaming Rose (or sometimes just The Order).</p>
<p>Roderick isn't an especially nice chap, and Geralt isn't a fan of his. To give you an idea of his personality, here is what his <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/61e8445b4b99d146d6c747b9631a83ce">Gwent card reads</a>:</p>
<p>"Count de Wett is exceptionally loathsome and arrogant, but at least he enjoys a little dice poker on the side."</p>
<p>While Roderick only - thus far - appears in CDPR's video game, there is a potential link to Sapkowski's written Witcher work. A Nilfgaardian noble by the name of Joachim de Wett pops up in books Time of Contempt, The Tower of the Swallow and The Lady of the Lake. Meanwhile, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Joachim_de_Wett#Trivia">Joachim's skull can also be found in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>. Given the name and both characters' backgrounds, it seems likely they are related in some way.</p>

<p>Myers won't be the only new face on the scene when The Witcher season four makes its debut. He will be joining newcomers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-casts-laurence-fishburne-for-fourth-season-of-netflix-show">Laurence Fishburne as Regis</a> and Danny Woodburn as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-the-witcher-series-adds-seinfeld-conan-star">Geralt's dwarf friend Zoltan Chivay</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-liam-hemsworth-hadnt-watched-netflix-show-or-read-the-books-before-geralt-casting">Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth is set to take on the mantle of The Witcher's white-haired monster hunter</a> for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">show's final two seasons</a>, following the departure of Henry Cavill.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-today-new-zone-dungeons-systems-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-free-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-on-march-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago, NCSoft and Amazon are launching the Wilds of Talandre expansion for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty today in Western territories.</p>
<p>This free update adds a ton of new content to the game, starting with the titular new zone of Talandre, which expands the playable space with a region filled with new challenges and rewards. Players can explore the Temple of Truth, face off against powerful new field bosses, and advance their characters to level 55 while new events are slowly unlocked.</p>
<p>Talandre has long been inhospitable to settlement due to its rugged terrain and unusually rampant demonic beasts. However, it later became home to refugees fleeing the oppression of the Crimson Family, who founded the village of Herba. Still, due to the harsh environment and deadly monsters, much of the natural world remains untouched.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre expansion adds Solo dungeons where players can hone their skills before going into Group dungeons, which are also being expanded with the new, more challenging 3-Star dungeons. There are three of them: Rancorwood, Hall of Tragedy, and Chapel of Madness, all of which are unlocked at the new level cap of 55.</p>
<p>If you're more into PvP, the new inter-server Nebula Island is a place where players can engage in PvP and PvE activities in six different regions, including one peaceful zone (Fog Forest) and four war zones where PvP is always enabled. Players can spend up to 7 hours per week on the island, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. Nebula Island will be enabled in a week from now.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre patch also revamps the Weapon mastery system and adds the new Artifact system. With regard to the former, Weapon mastery is now gained independently of which weapon the player has equipped; instead, they now have the option in the UI to select which weapon will receive the Weapon Mastery points. Mastery experience can also be increased through Weapon Mastery Seals acquired from various content. Lastly, Weapon mastery can now grow up to a maximum level of 200 per weapon.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRONE AND LIBERTY: Wilds of Talandre Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHkOc0xoyy4?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for Artifacts, they can be obtained from Nebula Island and the Abyss dungeons in Talandre. The system consists of six parts: 4 Talistones, a Solarstone and a Lunarstone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different sets across three levels (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare), with some stats randomly determined upon acquisition. Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching items from the same set. The Solar Stone grants an active ability, while the Lunar Stone grants a passive ability when equipped. Lastly, there are a few additions to the Lifestyle content featured in Throne and Liberty, such as 24 new fish, 10 new cooking recipes, and additional collectibles like the Cornelian Cherry Tree.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre update also improves some aspects of combat and movement in Throne and Liberty. The basic attack range of short-range melee weapons was increased, the movement speed reduction that applied to characters while using attack skills was removed, the player character will be more responsive after using movement skills, and the camera can be rotated when executing skills that previously locked the camera.</p>

<p>According to a reliable insider, the Gears of War collection will not feature PvP but include campaign co-op.</p>



<p>Yesterday, new details about the Gears of War collection surfaced through Detective Seeds on <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1897139827772170355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post stated that the game was seemingly added to the PlayStation Store backend, revealing new information about it. The leaker reported that the game will arrive in mid-2025 (August) and will not include multiplayer PvP content; the focus will be only on the campaign. A reliable insider has now corroborated the information about the Gears of War collection not featuring multiplayer PvP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jez Corden took to <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897334037204946947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> later to reveal what he knows about Gears of War Collection’s PvP status. In his recent thread on X, Corden stated, “I, too, have heard no multiplayer.” In the same thread, Corden was asked whether the collection would include campaign co-op, and he replied, “Yeah, co-op, but not PvP, is what I heard.”&nbsp;Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897535168300163490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that he is “looking into the Gears collection rumors” to find something concrete. </p>
