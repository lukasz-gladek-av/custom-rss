                <p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> arrives this August, it'll adopt a key aspect of College Football 25: its speed. Ask anyone who's played both of EA's American football games over the last year and they'll surely tell you College Football is much faster--they'll probably also tell you they preferred it over Madden's intentionally more sluggish gameplay. At the time, College Football was finding its old self, as the game was the first in EA's series in 11 years, and the entries of yesteryear tended to play faster and looser than Madden, too.</p><p dir="ltr">For the NFL sim, however, the slower gameplay was meant to differentiate it from College Football, and capture the way NFL players are on more even footing than their collegiate counterparts, where the delta between pro-bound elites and average student-athletes should and does feel vast. However, the Madden team has considered a great deal of community feedback and has decided to accelerate Madden 26, bringing it closer to the feel of the College Football series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZrgXXHSaBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">EA Tiburon's Isaac Etheridge, also known as "Spade" from his days as a Madden content creator, spoke at length about the changes players can expect, specifically based on player feedback. He led with game speed, signaling just how much the team understands this was an area it had to focus on. "We believe the NFL is the home of the fastest, most explosive players on the planet, right?So we knew something had to change. We started to validate this, both internally and externally," Etheridge said, explaining how the team used a prospective build of a faster Madden to test its favorability with players.</p><p>"We took a build of Madden 25--a special build with different locomotion--and we sent that out, and we asked people some very direct questions: 'Do you feel like you have more control? Is this more fun?' We validated this, and we realized our players want more control. They want more speed. They want that explosion. It was an easy decision to make."</p><p dir="ltr">Etheridge explained that Madden 26 doesn't precisely port over College Football 25's exact locomotion. Instead, it features a merging of "the best tuning sets" from both the Madden and College Football 25 locomotion systems. "We don't want you to play one game and say, 'Okay, this feels fast,' and play another game and go, 'What happened? Same [player] ratings--what happened? Why is this guy not as fast?' So we put both games on parity with a new locomotion set that we believe is the best for both types."</p><p dir="ltr">Soon after Etheridge spoke, I got to play Madden 26 for the first time, and I could see what he meant. It's not exactly like College Football 25, which still feels looser and faster overall, but Madden 26 surely feels closer. Madden 25 was, in my estimation, the first "slow" Madden since Madden 22, with 21, 23, and 24 all feeling faster in recent years. As you can probably infer (if you don't already know personally), the Madden game speed problem has long been a frustrating variable. Some games feel right, others don't, but consistency was elusive. You couldn't get used to how Madden felt because that feeling wasn't long for this world. However, it now seems that player feedback has been overwhelmingly in favor of a faster football game, leading the Madden team to adopt this style well into the future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png" data-ref-id="1300-4506340" data-ratio="0.59205426356589" data-width="1032" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png" data-ref-id="1300-4506340"></a><figcaption>Players like Xavier Worthy will feel more dangerous in Madden 26 thanks to its new locomotion system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506341,1300-4506342,1300-4506343,1300-4506344,1300-4506345" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My hope is that the re-emergence of College Football as an annual series helps guide the Madden team to more wise decisions like this one. A faster Madden is a better Madden. As Etheridge said when presenting to me and a room of roughly 50 other sports nerds, "a 4.2 [40-yard dash time] should feel like a 4.2." That's true at any level, and it's good to see the Madden team has seemingly figured that out for good this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Madden 26 is faster, but I'm no longer worried about that attribute being a fleeting high note before it slows down considerably again in Madden 27 or 28. As long as college football continues to earn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-and-ea-sports-college-football-25-hit-two-huge-us-sales-milestones/1100-6528544/">more money</a>, notch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/">higher review scores</a>, and total <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hit-5-million-players-in-its-first-week/1100-6525421/">more hours played</a> than Madden, it will likely dictate, or at least strongly suggest, the direction of Madden in some key ways. Madden will continue to have plenty of ways to differentiate itself from its brandmate, but in this way, it's wise to play catch-up.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on this year's NFL, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" data-ref-id="1100-6532037">how Madden 26 feels on Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-26-had-to-overhaul-several-in-game-mechanics-for-jaguars-rookie-travis-hunter/1100-6532039/" data-ref-id="1100-6532039">how the game was overhauled for one special player</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> is coming this summer, and when it arrives, you'll find that the team at Tiburon has done something it hasn't done before: It's added a new player ability based on a rookie. The game's library of X-Factor and Superstar abilities is a lengthy one that gets new additions every year, but Travis Hunter is the first rookie to inspire the team to think up a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability is called Iron Man, and it's designed to let Hunter play both sides of the ball more effectively. Hunter comes to Jacksonville with the bona fides to play both wide receiver and cornerback, and football experts everywhere are wondering if he can become the NFL's version of Shohei Ohtani: a two-way superstar the likes of whom only come around once in a generation, if that.</p><p dir="ltr">Madden developer Tiburon had to find a way to make this work in-game. Typically, a player who might play on both offense and special teams gets winded more easily, and a tired player is more likely to get hurt, commit penalties, or fumble if they're a ball carrier--not to mention slow down, of course. Because Hunter is expected to play both offense and defense, and has shown, at least in college, an ability to do this remarkably well, the Iron Man ability essentially rewrites his stamina drain. This allows him to fend off fatigue and the game's Wear and Tear injury system, which Madden 26 is adopting from College Football 25 and 26.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505608" data-ratio="0.5104" data-width="625" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505608"></a><figcaption>Saquon Barkley is on the cover on Madden this year, but it's probably not long before Travis Hunter lands on it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Similarly, a team's depth chart now allows for two-way players like Hunter. Before, if a player was starting on offense or defense, they could not start on the other side. The game wouldn't even populate those positions with most players; only a select few could be subbed in based on positional overlaps, like a safety playing in a linebacker spot in some defensive packages. Players who might appear in special formations--such as the Patriots' Marcus Jones, who can play returner, corner, and wide receiver--were given similar permissions in certain formations only. However, Hunter has forced a more pronounced change, and now players can be two-way players without these long-held restrictions--though that's not to say they'll be good at it.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, Hunter will be something of a unicorn. However, players in Franchise mode who delve deeply into the player-regeneration system--Madden's method of populating future years with fake draft prospects--may find that more two-way players emerge. Finding them and the other new draft archetypes is meant to be like an Easter egg for players, Franchise lead Josh Looman told me. "We'll see people on Reddit be like, 'Hey, I found this one guy.' We have a good laugh about it," Looman continued, "but yeah, we've got a good chunk more [draft prospect archetypes] this year, and we'll continue to do that in the future."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on my time with EA's next NFL sim, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" data-ref-id="1100-6532037">how Madden 26 performs on Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-best-feature-is-something-it-learned-from-college-football-25/1100-6532035/" data-ref-id="1100-6532035">how its biggest change is something it learned from College Football 25</a>.</p>

<p>Who doesn't love a bit of local love hidden inside video games. My mind immediately goes to Driver on the PS1, in which the developers hid a secret recreation of Newcastle in the UK. It remains true that the place in which a game is made can often seep inside the work of the creatives living there. A nice thought, especially for those from Regina. <a href="https://chl.ca/whl-pats/">Let's go Pats</a>!</p> <div>

Before the first reviews of the new console have appeared online, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pro-modding">YouTube channel ProModding</a> has already shared a 17-minute teardown video of the handheld that includes close-ups of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">custom Nvidia processor</a>.</p><p>Aside from Nintendo hiding a few screws and release latches beneath stickers on either side of the console, the teardown appears to be relatively straightforward if you already have the tools needed to carefully remove ribbon cables and other connectors and don’t care about voiding the Switch 2’s warranty.</p><p>The teardown doesn’t provide many new insights into the Switch 2’s internal hardware, but ProModding did share a few observations of the new console. The Joy-Con controllers do sit tighter when attached to the Switch 2 than they did on the original, but can still be wobbled. Nintendo appears to be using the same types of thermal paste it used on the first Switch, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVxMUmT11e0">some gamers have replaced</a> to improve performance and prolong the life of their consoles.</p><p>They also note that the folding support stand on the back of the Switch 2 is “too flimsy” and that there is a “high risk of breakage” when attempting to unfold it from only one side.</p><p>If you want to know how repairable the Switch 2 is, you might need to wait for iFixit’s teardown. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678622/ifixit-nerfs-nintendo-switch-repair-score-battery-drift">iFixit retroactively reduced the original Nintendo Switch’s repair score</a> from the 8 out of 10 it gave the console in 2017 to a 4 out of 10, based more on its battery setup and progress made by competitors like Valve’s Steam Deck than the finicky Joy-Con sticks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Switch 2 also has new software features like the Discord-like GameChat, which could make it easier to trash talk your friends. There are new accessories, too, including an improved Pro Controller.</p><p>Now that the Switch 2 is finally in people’s hands, we can all dive in on what it’s like to actually have the console in our homes and in our bags. And, of course, there will be lots of games to play.</p><p>Here’s all of our coverage of the launch.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5MzY3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679367/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-update-gamechat-mouse-controls">Fortnite on the Switch 2 will support GameChat and mouse controls</a></h2><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">the Switch 2</a> with some massive visual improvements and new features that are going to make it feel like a new game for the Nintendo crowd.</p><p>While we knew that <em>Fortnite </em>would be playable on the Switch 2 at launch, today <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">Epic announced</a> all of the new features that are being incorporated into the game via an update. After years of maxing out at 30 fps on the original Switch, <em>Fortnite </em>will now run at 60fps on the Switch 2. The game is also getting a resolution bump to 2176x1224 when docked and 1600x900 when undocked (up from 1560x880 docked / 1170x660 undocked). Draw distance, textures, shadows, and water rendering are also getting an overall quality boost that will make the game more crisp.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679367/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-update-gamechat-mouse-controls">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The Switch 2 will let you hoard up to 30,000 screenshots.</p><p>The original Switch capped the number of screenshots you could save to a meager 10,000, but for the Switch 2 Nintendo has increased the limit to 30,000, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-allows-you-to-save-up-to-30000-screenshots/">according to <em>NintendoSoup</em></a>. That’s split between the console’s system memory and a microSD card, with each having a capacity of 15,000 images.</p><p>The Switch 2 can also store up to 6,500 30 second videos — 1,500 in its system memory, and an additional 5,000 on a microSD card.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Welp, that didn’t take long at all.</p><p>While parts of the world are still watching for deliveries and setting up shop in front of GameStops and BestBuys waiting for a Switch 2, some folks have already gotten a head start on the Great Nintendo Content Rush of 2025.</p><p>Already there are <em>multiple</em> streams on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mario+kart+world">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/mario-kart-world">Twitch</a> showing off <em>Mario Kart World</em> to the envy of the rest of us plebs.

According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andyrobinson.bsky.social/post/3lqrwa2ehur26"><em>VGC’s</em> Andy Robinson</a>, logging in after a system transfer (and day one update download) is a lot like an Xbox, with all of your Switch 2 games ready to install.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5MzI3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679327/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-teardown">Look inside the Nintendo Switch 2 with the console’s first teardown</a></h2><div><p>It’s already<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details"> June 5th</a> in some parts of the world, which means the Nintendo Switch 2 is now out in the wild.

I, too, will be playing some <em>World</em>, in part because it’s one of the few game series that my wife and I enjoy playing together (and I need to justify this purchase somehow). But, it won’t be the first thing I’m doing.</p><p>I won’t be licking any cartridges either — I already know they’re going to taste bad — or huffing Switch 2 exhaust fumes. Actually, I’m sad to say that the very first thing I’ll be doing with my unit is plugging it in to charge and walking away for a while to pick my kid up from gym class.

Non-<em>Sonic </em>characters have appeared in previous <em>Sonic</em> racing games, including <em>Team Fortress 2</em> mercs and more.

How Insider got their hands on it is unknown.</p><p>Of course, until Sega officially announces any of this, this could all still fall apart, or some of this content might not ever see the light of day. Still, the leaks seem to indicate that Sega is heavily invested in developing this crossover content. It seems very likely that in the near future, SpongeBob, Sonic, and Alex from <em>Minecraft</em> will be racing each other in the sewers of <em>TMNT</em>. Slowly, everything merges together as we march to our grey goo pop culture future. Exciting times. </p><p><em>Sonic Racing Crossworlds</em> is launching sometime later this year for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The logical answer is “I will play <em>Mario Kart World</em>,” and I respect those of you who feel that way. I, too, will be playing some <em>World</em>, in part because it’s one of the few game series that my wife and I enjoy playing together (and I need to justify this purchase somehow). But, it won’t be the first thing I’m doing.</p><p>I won’t be licking any cartridges either — I already know they’re going to taste bad — or huffing Switch 2 exhaust fumes. Actually, I’m sad to say that the very first thing I’ll be doing with my unit is plugging it in to charge and walking away for a while to pick my kid up from gym class. However, when I return I’ll be tearing through the setup screens, and… seeing how <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic">Metroid Prime Remastered</a></em> looks.</p><p>Don’t dash my dreams of the Switch 2’s graphics upscaling giving all of my Switch favorites a glow-up. I <em>know </em>that’s probably not how this is going to work, having seen how Sony’s PSSR tech can’t “automagically” make PS4 games run better in a much more powerful console, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a>. Let me live in that fleeting moment before hope inevitably turns to melancholy, after which I’ll wait for Nintendo to (hopefully) trickle out updates on a game-by-game basis.</p><p>Anyway… what will you be doing first with your Switch 2?

            <p>Witcher fans have naturally been busy poring over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">tech demo</a> in search of interesting details beyond the big obvious teases. One group on Reddit reckon their ears picked up the voice of Witcher 3 actor Richard Hawley.</p>
<p>Hawley voiced a few characters in Gerry from the Riviera’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">clash with the Wild Hunt</a>, with Caleb Menge, Francis Bedlam, and Redanian schemer Sigismund Dijkstra all boasting his dulcet tones. It’s that last one that’ll likely have lodged the actor’s voice into your brain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It’s also the name that some Witcher fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1l2eys9/did_anyone_else_recognise_dijkstras_voice_actor/">Reddit</a> have admitted they shouted at the screen when Ciri chats to a bearded merchant about her current monster contract at around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nthv4xF_zHU">ten minute mark</a>, after taking a walk through Valdrest. I’ve taken a listen to both the merchant and Dijikstra, and the two do sound a bit alike to me, especially when the merchant says certain phrases. I’ve also reached out to CD Projekt for confirmation.</p>
<p>As some of the fans in the Reddit thread have pointed out, if this is indeed Hawley, he’d be an interestingly fitting inclusion in this particular tech demo. In addition to those characters he voiced in The Witcher 3, Hawley also voiced a number in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition">The Witcher 2</a>. One of these is Carduin of Lan Exeter, a Koviri mage Geralt meets during the summit at Loc Muinne.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed from his name, this wizard is from the city that CD Projekt ended TW4’s tech demo by teasing via a shot of Ciri looking out at it nestled in the distance. Spoilers for The Witcher 3 and The Witcher 2 incoming, so skip the next couple of paragraphs if you want to miss them.</p>
<p>Carduin’s exact fate in the series so far is influenced by the choices you made at the conclusion of The Witcher 2, but it is possible to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWttKXXDVPY">run into him</a> in The Witcher 3 depending on what you picked.</p>
<p>If you do, he’ll be in Oxenfurt serving alongside Radovid of Redania, as a result of needing to avoid being burned at the stake, and to my knowledge isn’t confirmed as being killed alongside the ruler if you choose to aid in Radovid’s assassination. So, it seems possible he could show up in The Witcher 4, especially if the game’s story involves matters affecting Koviri politics or involving magic in the region, which seems a good shout if it's more than a brief stop in whatever journey Ciri’s on. I'd certainly be up for it, even if just to potentially see Esterad Thyssen in non-Gwent card form.</p>
<p>As it is, TW3 and TW2 had Hawley voicing multiple characters - ones who were all key figures in Novigrad in the case of the latter. If this tech demo merchant is played by him and ends up being in the final game, I’d wager there’s a good chance it’ll just be one of the times you hear his voice. For now, though, all any of us outside of CD Projekt can do is speculate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> on Steam's Top Sellers chart, one day before its early launch for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners. Only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> seems able to keep the Survival MMO at bay.</p>
<p>The game previously hit a concurrent player peak of 37,889 during a closed weekend beta, initially limited to those invited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">but opened up to pre-orderers near the conclusion</a>. These folks were able to play through the same early portion as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">our lovely Bertie dived into in the Eurogamer preview</a>.</p>
<p>It has managed to slip past Elden Ring Nightreign, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">which had a strong start on Steam</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">recently surpassing the 3.5m sales mark across all platforms</a>. It's worth noting of course that Nightreign came out last Friday, so it was bound to start trickling down the Top Sellers chart sooner or later.</p>

<p>Dune Awakening, the next big release from Funcom, releases for all players on 10th June, but those looking to hop in tomorrow will have to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99  for the Deluxe Edition. Obviously, there's no way to differentiate which version Steam users are buying to cause this surge up the store page, but it's certainly a good indicator for initial interest.</p>
<p>Recently, Funcom peeled back the curtain on the mid - end game experience in Dune Awakening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMpSKFSWjMM">in a lengthy live stream</a>, providing much-needed information on what those who sink dozens if not hundreds of hours into the game will actually be doing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.vg247.com/">VG247</a> also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/dune-awakenings-creative-director-speaks-on-the-end-game-and-how-the-landsraad-will-give-key-roles-to-crafter-and-killer-alike">interviewed the creative director on the Landsraad system</a>, a rotating semi-randomised set of server wide tasks the Atreides and Harkonnen will be battling over.</p>
<p>For those unaware the game follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-devs-explain-their-alt-history-approach-to-the-vast-intricate-follow-up-to-conan-exiles">an alternate history of Frank Herbert's sci-fi series of novels</a>, though aesthetically more aligned with the recent films by Denis Villeneuve. Its creators at Funcom were responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-secret-world-preview-2">The Secret World</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anarchy-online">Anarchy Online.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/playdate-season-2-unearths-the-best-game-about-digging-since-minecraft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I yearn for the excavation site. This is the result of spending too much time with Dig Dig Dino, the newest release from Playdate’s long awaited Season 2, and a game about digging up dinosaurs and detritus.</p>
<p>It is, as with many of Playdate’s games, presented with an untold amount of charm and carefully cultivated visuals, making the most of the handheld’s crisp monochrome screen, with a tightly crafted gameplay loop that is surprisingly moorish. It’s about digging. And it’s good.</p>
<p>Your archeological team are a series of humanoid animals, led by a canine chap in a jacket – Dig Dig Dino’s Alan Grant – with each of your companions in charge of an important sector for your dig, including the archivist collecting artefacts, a scientist collecting DNA strands – when has that ever worked out? – and a tech guru who provides you with upgrades and enhancements like Q from James Bond, only he’s a pig. No, not a chauvinist pig, an actual one.</p>

<p>The central gameplay loop revolves around digging. You have a set amount of energy, as well as a shovel and a drill, and each time you dig through a particular layer of soil, you use up some energy. Rocks are your main nemesis, and you have to drill these into oblivion to get to the sweet bones beneath, with some taking multiple hits to shatter. When your energy runs out, that’s the end of this run.</p>

<p>You then take the cash you’ve earned from whatever you’ve dug up – whether that’s coins, trash or actual archeological finds – and buy upgrades, improving how much digging your spade does, or gaining new technology like a radar that helps you locate items of interest. Once you’ve spent all your money, you head out to dig up some more things, and start all over again.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, you’ll keep doing it. It probably shouldn’t work, but there’s something hugely appealing and fundamentally satisfying about clearing an area or digging deeper to find the missing DNA strand for a particular dinosaur. There’s also a puzzle element to it, uncovering the tip of a bone or artefact, and then working out the most efficient way to excavate it with the energy you have remaining.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of longevity here, with multiple areas each hiding a series of skeletons, as well as different artefacts and treasures. When many Playdate games have a finite lifespan, or explore a very acute set of mechanics or ideas, Dig Dig Dino has just the right hook to keep you coming back.</p>
<p>Dig Dig Dino is just delightful, and it goes to show just what developers can achieve with the consistently surprising handheld.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft is not hosting its annual Ubisoft Forward event this year, for the first time since Ubisoft began running its '<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forward-july-e3-style-game-reveals/">Ubisoft Forward' showcases in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Wccftech reached out to Ubisoft to confirm the initial report, but the confirmation first came from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z">Game File founder and reporter Stephen Totilo</a>, who was told by a Ubisoft representative that the company is <em>"always eager to connect with our players and showcase our</em> <em>games</em>" and that it is "<em>continuing to explore opportunities to share updates, and we look forward to providing more information at a later date</em>."</p>
<p>Wccftech was also told, as was Totilo, that we'll see Ubisoft participating in other aspects of Summer Game Fest, including the IGN Live event this weekend between June 7 and 8 and the PC Gaming Show on June 8. We'll also see Ubisoft later this summer at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqqfmg47ok2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreih6cxjkkvnfc6bjjpdzmcgfmbmrw3uwtreebolpz3jejeluqul4bm">
<p lang="en">Ubisoft Forward, which has been a digital and in-person showcase for the company's games just about every June, isn't happening this year.A company rep tells me Ubisoft will participate in IGN Live (June 7-8) and PC Gaming Show (June 8) and will also be at GamesCom</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d?ref_src=embed">Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z?ref_src=embed">2025-06-03T23:03:50.202Z</a></p></blockquote>


<p>When Wccftech reached out to confirm Totilo's report, we also asked for any further clarification as to why the decision was made to skip 2025, and if the event will return next year. We simply received the same statement that was initially reported, with no further clarification.</p>
<p>Though, as Totilo points out, it's not the biggest surprise that Ubisoft is taking a year off. To say that Ubisoft is going through a big internal shift at the moment would be an understatement, as it is figuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">out a new structure post its deal with Tencent</a>, which could very well lead to <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">more layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the company's biggest series are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/">nowhere to be seen</a>, seemingly in a state of<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/"> development limbo</a>, and that's before getting into other issues the company is currently facing, with former executives from the company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too">currently on trial for alleged sexual harassment</a>.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/">has done incredibly well</a>, sure, but it's the lone big win Ubisoft has had to cut its streak of losses from 2024. And just yesterday, the company's failed multiplayer shooter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-now-taken-offline-forever/">XDefiant, was officially taken offline forever</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what the company has for the events it is confirmed to participate in this weekend, but with everything it has going on, it's almost no wonder why Yves Guillemot didn't want to stand on a stage to celebrate the company's short and long-term future.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> is about to take flight on yet another new platform: developer Hello Games announced today that the sci-fi exploration game will be getting a free update that will enhance it for the Nintendo Switch 2, which launches on June 5th.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23179322/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-release-date">The game came to the original Switch in 2022</a>, and Hello Games says getting it crammed onto Nintendo’s previous console was “a bit of a technical miracle,” while calling the Switch 2 version “a huge leap forward.” On the Switch 2, the game will improve both the amount and quality of stuff on screen at any given moment. “We’re rendering significantly more than before, at a higher resolution <em>and </em>improved framerate,“ the developer says.</p><p>It will also feature full multiplayer support, which was missing from the first Switch version of the game. Additionally, the Switch 2 version of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> will include features like touchscreen support, gyro controls, and cross-save.</p><p>The new platform is part of a larger update that spans all versions of the game. Called Beacon, it introduces something of a settlement management element to the game. Here’s how Hello Games explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>Beacon completely overhauls settlements, bringing towns and their management to No Man’s Sky. There are huge new robotic settlements to discover, with impossibly new sci-fi buildings. Players can become town mayor and take ownership of multiple settlements. You can construct buildings and upgrade each one, with new building types like jukebox bars where you can choose the music, merchants where you can build custom starships or even ponds you can chill and fish at.</p><p>Each inhabitant can be conversed with, with their own abilities and attributes to manage. As town mayor you’ll be enlisted to welcome new settlers, resolve disputes, and make choices to create prosperity. A well managed settlement can make their owners rich in resources, but they need to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen, who will now defend towns when they come under attack from roving pirates.</p></blockquote></div><p>As with all updates for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, Beacon will be free to download. It launches today.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Switch 2 not only increases that limit to 15,000 for the console itself, it also lets you store another 15,000 screenshots on the auxiliary microSD Express card.

The update adds a new questline, new recipes, rare fish to collect and display in your C.A.M.P., and of course, a chill new pastime that can be enjoyed anywhere across the map.</p><p>Fishing can be unlocked through the new Casting Off questline, which can be accessed through a new location in the Mire known as Fisherman's Rest. The questline will give players the base-level fishing rod, which can then be upgraded through Tinker's Workbench.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fallout 76 Season 21 Gone Fission Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The fishing rod isn't an item that needs to be manually equipped; instead, just go up to any body of water and select the "Fish" command when it shows up on screen. Fishing isn't contained to just the new area. You can fish anywhere across the map with a handy mantra: If you can swim in it, you can fish in it.</p><p>There are a number of fish to be caught in Fallout 76, from generic fish to regional fish that have differing levels of rarity from common to super rare. The rarest catch is a super-cute axolotl--there are twelve of them to be caught, with one unique axolotl available to be caught every month.</p><p>You'll have to upgrade both your bait and your rod to have a chance at catching rarer fish, and the weather will play a part in what you can catch, too. Fish you catch can be eaten as is, broken down into Fish Bits that can be used in recipes, or saved and displayed in your C.A.M.P. with a new fish-display item.</p><p>The Gone Fission season also adds a heap of new fishing-related items. Check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-new-season-has-the-best-name-includes-basket-of-dead-fish/1100-6531784/" data-ref-id="1100-6531784">everything new in seasonal content here</a>.</p><p>While the fishing additions make up the majority of the latest patch, Bethesda is continuing with major combat balance changes first initiated in last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fallout-76-everything-new-in-the-skyline-valley-update/2900-5472/" data-ref-id="2900-5472">Skyline Valley update</a>.

        <p>Is it just me, or is the game's second anniversary event kinda nothing?</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The time has come to celebrate the second anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Yes, the game has been out for two years now, even if it does not feel like it's been that long. And with every anniversary, of course, comes a new event from Blizzard designed to commemorate it.</p>
<p>The second Anniversary Celebration is now live in-game. And, honestly, does not feel like that much of a big deal. At all.</p>
<p>The Diablo 4 Second Anniversary event is available from now until Tuesday, 17th June, giving you about two weeks to take part in the muted festivities. And you'd only really want to do that, of course, if you care about the rewards you could get from grinding through the activities; rewards which this event does actually have, even if they're nothing to really write home about.</p>
<p>Now that Diablo 4 has <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-season-8-belials-return-new-battle-pass-reliquary-details">adopted Call of Duty's battle pass system</a>, there's a new Event Reliquary (which is essentially a mini-battle pass) that runs parallel to the Season 8 Reliquary. While the new system <em>does</em> offer more utility, and is practically designed for situations like this, it has not been well received by players <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-reliquaries-new-battle-pass-system-season-8-player-reaction">because of how little of the premium currency it offers compared to the old style</a>.</p>
<p>But we're not here to talk about that, we're here to reveal the rewards... all six of them. As part of the event Reliquary, you'll be able to exchange your Gold for these rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunflame Lantern Mount Trophy.</li>
<li>Burning Dawn Banner Mount Trophy.</li>
<li>Sunraiser Sword Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Sunflame Sword Two-Handed Sword Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Burning Barbs Polearm Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Burning Dawn Bow Cosmetic.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<figcaption>Look at my horse, my horse is amazing. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you've collected all six of the skins above, you'll automatically earn The Burning Dawn Mount Armor. Having Gold set as the currency of this particular event is certainly interesting, mainly because it doesn't involve some other paid currency, or any sort of in-game grinding. You will, of course, need to have enough Gold to be able to afford everything, but farming Gold isn't difficult, and gives you the freedom to do whatever you want in the game (rather than force you into certain time-gated events).</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-berserk-cross-over-event-details-skins-gameplay-cosmetics">Berserk collaboration event</a> certainly reminded everyone why limited-time events exist to begin with, with its meagre in-game rewards, and a skin pack that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-berserk-cross-over-event-cosmetics-skins-prices">would've run you £110 if you wanted the actually good cosmetics</a>.</p>
<p>Given that, many players will no doubt be happy to learn that there are zero skins being sold for real money as part of the Anniversary event. As a bonus, a Mother's Blessing event will also be running right alongside the two-year party, giving everyone 35 percent extra XP, and 50 percent extra Gold.</p>
<p>This improved version of Mother's Blessing also means each time you turn in your Grim Favors at the Tree of Whispers, you'll receive an extra cache, which includes items you'd find in a Collection of Chaos cache. If you've been away from the game for a while, or don't know what that means, trust me when I say: it's a pretty good boon to have.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Could Nintendo be planning to do the exact same thing for the series' follow-up? It seems very likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki acknowledged that 200cc had been a popular addition to the series, but stopped short of confirming anything around its return — for now. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes likes this," Kosuke teased. "However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not surprising that Nintendo has not included 200cc within Mario Kart World at launch. The mode's arrival at a later date allows the game's fans to learn courses and get used to playing at the standard 150cc (or lower, if you need) before the tougher challenge of 200cc arrives at a later date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will likely only be more of a consideration with Mario Kart World's multiplayer-friendly gameplay, in which groups of players are encouraged to team up and explore together, their GameChat open, and cameras switched on. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Presumably, whenever Mario Kart World's 200cc update does arrive, all players will need to be playing at the same level to explore the game's map together. It's therefore better, once again, to let players get to grips with 150cc first before things step up a gear, or engine size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World launches this week alongside Nintendo Switch 2, and boasts a seamless map that can be explored at will. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is">Just don't go into this offering expecting it to be like Forza Horizon</a>, IGN has said. And in other important Mario Kart news, IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-cow-eat-beef-we-asked-the-mario-kart-world-producer">asked Nintendo if the game's already-beloved Cow character is really eating beef</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-the-witcher-4-tech-demo-what-the-witcher-4-will-actually-look-like-we-asked-cd-projekt<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stunning-the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo-shows-open-world-running-on-base-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">The Witcher 4 tech demo</a> offered a stunning look at what CD Projekt has insisted is just that: a tech demo. As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-does-not-fully-represent-the-final-game-cd-projekt-clarifies-visuals-reflect-the-direction-were-taking">it is not representative of The Witcher 4 gameplay</a>. But it’s hard not to look at the Unreal Engine 5 tech demo set within the world of The Witcher and wonder if it gives us a clear sense of what to expect from the game, which is still years from release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech demo, captured on a PlayStation 5 and running at 60 frames per second, follows Ciri as she explores the never-before-seen region of Kovir in the midst of a monster contract (CD Projekt confirmed Kovir is a playable area in The Witcher 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is an incredible amount of detail in the tech demo, with fluid animations on a level we have yet to see on the current generation of consoles. Ciri and her horse Kelpie have particularly impressive movement and interactions with each other, NPCs, and the game world as they make their way through the mountains of Kovir to the bustling port town of Valdrest. At one point in the demo, CD Projekt upped the NPC count in the market scene to 300 individually animated characters. The showcase ended with a first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital and a major port city in Kovir.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt, of course, knows what it’s like to set expectations for one of its upcoming video games and then miss them. Just look at the disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077 back in 2020, which the company spent years recovering from. So, there is an inevitable question for CD Projekt: is what we’ve seen in The Witcher 4 tech demo what The Witcher 4 will look like?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a question we put to Kajetan Kapuściński, Cinematic Director at CD Projekt, at Epic’s State of Unreal 2025 event. His response was as vague as you’d expect from a developer working on a game that won’t be released until 2027 at the earliest, but he did say this: the tech demo "shows our ambition."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Kapuściński’s response in full:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So what you've seen today is a tech demo that was powered by Unreal Engine 5, and that was a project that we worked on together with the Epic team. That was a demo that we crafted so both companies can work on some technology that will be powering Witcher 4 in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So it's not gameplay of The Witcher 4 per se. What you have seen shows our ambition, our cutting edge technology that we co-developed to make the game possible to be made. And it shows our artistic direction as well, and our, let's say, how we would like to approach some things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But everything you saw is subject to be changed. That is a snippet of what we have now. We wanted to show it to the public, we wanted to show what we worked on together. And now having these tools, having these possibilities, we are working with the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, we asked Wyeth Johnson, Senior Director, Product Strategy at Epic Games, if the tech demo’s performance (60fps with ray tracing on a base PS5) reflects what players can expect to play on a PS5 in a released product.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh absolutely. We can't lie here," he replied. “The technology that we're making has to be directly relevant for what players expect and players across the entire hardware spectrum are asking for amazing 60 frame per second gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">60fps with ray tracing in a big open-world game like The Witcher 4 on base PS5 is beyond the performance we’ve come to expect from the current generation of consoles, but Johnson said working with CD Projekt on The Witcher 4 tech demo “allowed us to push very rapidly and aggressively towards far higher performance at incredible fidelity.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, clearly, is beyond what we’re expecting from the five-year-old PS5. Players have become conditioned to believe that if they're playing on a PlayStation or an Xbox and they want ray tracing, it’s 30 frames per second and that’s it. But Johnson insisted the console hardware “is incredible” and there’s more performance to be squeezed out of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What you have to do is you have to be clever about how you take advantage of that hardware,” he said. “And I think if you were to summarize many of the things that we did, it's to take things that normally happen serially one after another and make them go wide, make them go parallel. Much more hardware capability is harnessed when you take that approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you look at things like our new Unreal animation framework and this fast geometry streaming, letting you move through the environment at whatever speed is desired, all of these things are there to go much more wide, and that enables you to unlock the hardware a little bit more easily. And these are intrinsic to Unreal Engine going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have to take time to understand how you can unlock all these little amazing capabilities that were handed by the hardware manufacturers. You work with it and you find the areas, you find the bottlenecks and you optimize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's somewhat remarkable; if you look at some of our more early demos, you're seeing two, three, 10x improvements in performance with very, very similar visuals, and that's just you're finding the edge cases, you're finding the ways to improve, and then you go right down to the bottom and make those intrinsic to what Unreal can do. Then amazing developers like CD Project Red get to then build on top of that.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expectation for The Witcher 4 is sky-high, and fans want to know exactly what to expect from the game right now. On this, Kapuściński kept his cards close to his chest. But he did offer a tease of sorts:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you analyze the flow of the demo, you can actually pick up some elements that can show the direction that we are heading to, and the possibilities that come with our cooperation and what we've achieved so far. So for example, looking at the forest, there's this vista bit when you can see a huge forest, which is now using Nanite foliage. The ability to render such amount of trees and foliage of such fidelity, that's something that unlocks new powers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And also the Unreal animation framework, the optimization that comes with the amount of NPCs, so moving characters that you can see in the screen space. We have another vista moment with the huge crowd, like over 300 animated actors there. And that's something we need, and that's something that if you connect some dots that shows the direction we want to go to.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, huge, highly detailed forests and huge, highly detailed crowds confirmed for The Witcher 4!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions about The Witcher 4 is target launch platforms. With this tech demo on PS5, the suggestion is it will be a cross-gen game that also runs on the next-gen consoles (PS6 and the next-gen Xbox). But if it’s due out on current-gen, does that also mean it will be available on the underpowered Xbox Series S? It’s worth remembring that Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto VI is, as it stands, also due out on current-gen consoles including the Xbox Series S. So if GTA 6 is possible on Microsoft’s cheaper console, perhaps The Witcher 4 is, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest"><u>CD Projekt has indicated The Witcher 4 won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest</u></a>, so it may be some time before we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
