            <p>Sony is continuing its game to big (and small) screen push, last week announcing films based on both its Horizon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> series. Details were still fairly thin on the ground at this time, but now Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt has confirmed one thing about the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> adaptation: the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, but in a somewhat limited capacity.</p>
<p>And, that's the way it should be, the exec says.</p>

</figure>
<p>This little titbit comes from an exchange on social media platform X, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-developers-dont-and-shouldnt-have-final-say-on-the-upcoming-movie">IGN</a>. When one fan asked whether or not the Helldivers 2 studio would be involved in the film's production to ensure the adaptation stays faithful to the source material, Pilestedt admitted he had been "dodging this question" since the announcement.</p>
<p>"The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we'll see," the CCO replied, before acknowledging the Helldivers 2 development team "are not Hollywood people", and therefore "don't know what it takes to make a movie".</p>
<p>Baring all this in mind, Pilestedt therefore said the studio won't have the final say on the film. And, in his opinion, nor should it really, which I guess makes sense.</p>
<p>It still hasn't been revealed who will be taking on the role of director for the Helldivers 2 film. In fact, other than word that a film is in the pipeline as part of a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures, there is not much else concrete to say at the present time.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to announce we are working with Sony Pictures on developing a film adaptation of our amazingly popular PlayStation game, Helldivers 2," was all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash said during its reveal at CES last week</a>.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hey! I've been dodging this question. The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we'll see.

		<p>Capcom has released a new gameplay trailer for Fatal Fury’s Mai, who is part of Street Fighter VI’s Year 2 Character Pass. The trailer shows her facing off against Chun Li and Ryu in two different bouts, wearing two different outfits, both from her Fatal Fury wardrobe. Mai has been part of the Fatal Fury series since Fatal Fury 2, which released back in 1992.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 - Mai Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhcsgO4jse4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, Mai brings her Shiranui Ninja style into the fighter mix of Street Fighter VI. It is a hand to hand style that also encompasses throws, kicks, elbows, fire, and paper fans. Players who like putting together combos will have plenty to work with when it comes to Mai’s fighting style, and it looks like it will favour those who prefer fast moving characters. Mai will be available from February 5th in Street Fighter VI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">In our Street Fighter 6 Review,</a>&nbsp;Nick said,&nbsp;<em>“Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday evening, Polish developer Rebel Wolves finally unveiled its debut project, a single player open world roleplaying game titled The Blood of Dawnwalker. During a livestreamed event, fans were able to learn more about the game, watch the gorgeous CGI trailer, and even get a brief sneak peek at in-game footage.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> three years ago by former The Witcher III: Wild Hunt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz following his departure from CD Projekt RED. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">securing investment</a> from NetEase, the studio signed a deal to publish their first title <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Bandai Namco</a>.</p>
<p>The influence of The Witcher III is pretty clear, although there are more than a few twists. The Blood of Dawnwalker is set in 14th-century Carpathia, in the fictional region of Vale Lenora. While not a high fantasy game, the setting definitely supports magic and supernatural inspired by dark fantasy universes. The story begins when, at the height of the Black Plague, a group of powerful vampires leaps out of the shadows to overthrow the feudal lords and take the Vale for themselves. They're led by an old and very powerful vampire called Brencis, who promises security to the battered inhabitants. Of course, that protection comes at a heavy cost - regular blood masses where humans have to donate their blood, no matter the consequences for them.</p>
<p>In the CGI trailer, we see protagonist Coen's first encounter with the vampires. Just as the human lords are about to burn Coen's sister, who is infected with the Black Plague, the vampires arrive and slaughter them all. Then, they hear Coen's plea to save her and proceed to heal the little girl with their blood (which does not turn her into a vampire).</p>
<p>The game begins around two years after that event. Coen has since been turned into kind of a vampire himself, but as you might have guessed from the title, he's a special one. Due to his argyria, a silver poisoning he got when working in the silver mines, he is weaker than a regular vampire but also not fully transformed, which means he can still walk among humans during the day.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will reportedly feature two different loops for day and night. During the day, Coen will essentially fight like a human (barring some occult magic he'll be able to learn throughout the game); however, during the night, he'll be able to use his vampire powers. He'll need them, as there are other supernatural foes than just vampires that have come out since Brencis took over: undead, Kobolds, and some creatures called uriashes.</p>
<p>Being an open world roleplaying game, it's not surprising to hear confirmation that players will be able to befriend or become the enemy of various characters. The former would probably be smarter to further Coen's ultimate goal of taking down Brencis and freeing his family, though he can go entirely solo as well. However, players will only have 30 days and nights to make him succeed. This also inevitably means they won't be able to complete all the stories (which Rebel Wolves is not splitting traditionally into main and side quests) in a single playthrough. There's one more mechanics that needs to be monitored at all times: blood hunger. Not only will Coen be weaker in combat if not fed, but he might lose control and kill even a friend, potentially also failing a quest.</p>

<p>All of this sounds very interesting, to say the least. This Unreal Engine 5 powered game will receive its full gameplay reveal this Summer. There's no release window yet, but we already know The Blood of Dawnwalker will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>A recent batch of trademarks filed by Sega suggests another classic video game series could be set to make a return.</p>
<p>As spotted by Gematsu, Sega filed two trademarks towards the end of last month. Those trademarks? "Ecco the Dolphin" and "Ecco".</p>
<p>The filings were made in Japan on 27th December, before they were subsequently made public yesterday.</p>

<p>Ecco the Dolphin was released all the way back in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis, for those over the pond).</p>
<p>As I am sure you have no doubt figured, the game stars a dolphin by the name of Ecco. Our poor lead gets separated from his pod at the start of the game, and as such must find his way through the waters to reunite with them. This sees (or seas) Ecco negotiating underwater cave systems while booping jelly fish and such out of his way. Ecco eventually comes across other unexpected areas and creatures, but I will keep those as a surprise for those who don't already know.</p><p>Ecco the Dolphin was developed by Novotrade International and published by SEGA. A sequel - Ecco: The Tides of Time - was then released in 1994. Two spinoffs in the Ecco Jr line were released in 1995, before a reboot known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ecco-defender-future">Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</a> was then released in 2000 for the Dreamcast. This is the last game in the series, as development on another instalment was cancelled back in 2001.</p>
<p>More recently, Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time were delisted from Steam, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-delisting-over-60-classic-games-from-virtual-stores-including-jet-set-radio-and-crazy-taxi">Sega set about removing over 60 of its classic games from virtual stores</a>.</p>
<p>So, could we see the return of Ecco in the near future? I shore am excited to find out.</p>

<p>This project was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">five fresh titles in classic franchises announced in December 2023</a>, alongside new entries in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>, Shinobi, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage series.</p></div>

		<p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/bandai-namco-will-publish-rebel-wolves-rpg-dawnwalker/">Bandai Namco and new studio Rebel Wolves</a> agreed a publishing deal for Rebel Wolves new RPG, at the time named Dawnwalker. Rebel Wolves was founded in 2022 by the game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. He has been joined by other CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Today, the first cinematic and gameplay teaser for The Blood of Dawnwalker has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkICrJEVTjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is set in Europe during the 14th century, with the Black Plague wiping out people at a high rate. One of the people affected is Lunka, the sister of main character Coen. In the trailer, you can see him fleeing a patrol to stop them from killing his sister and ending up in a ruined church. Cornered, Coen is saved by an unlikely source. That is a vampire and his allies. The vampire saves Lunka’s life, but has his own motivations to take advantage of humanity’s time of weakness to grab power and gain freedom, along with other creatures of the night.</p>
<p>While the cinematic ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, the trailer shows some gameplay with Coen wielding dark powers. Coen is the Daywalker, and the assumption is that the vampire made him this way as payment for saving Lunka. Coen has vampiric powers but can navigate the world during the day. As the story of The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp; progresses, players will make choices on whether to try and remain human or use the vampiric dark powers, moving further away from humanity. You will also be able to use a combo of human and vampire skills in combat, with all sorts of foes from soldiers to other monsters being enemies. Allies could be found among any group too, be they human or a creature of the night. It all depends on the decisions you make as Coen.</p>

<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker does not have a release date yet, and a gameplay reveal will be coming in the summer. The Blood of Dawnwalker has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-vr-no-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a post on social media, FuturLab’s CEO, Kirsty Rigden, revealed that the team is unable to support PowerWash Simulator VR going forward. This decision was made to support the job security of staff across the company, and instead of making layoffs, the team working on the VR version of the game has been ‘redeployed’ on other projects and roles.</p>



<p>This means that while the game remains available on storefronts, it will no longer receive any further updates, support, or DLC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-must-be-so-disappointed">‘You Must Be So Disappointed’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1878840388578169168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the post on Twitter</a> (X), Rigden wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am so sorry to let you know that we won’t be continuing support of PowerWash Simulator VR. We absolutely love and believe in VR, so this doesn’t mean that we won’t support it in the future but we aren’t able to continue with support right now.</p>



<p>We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job opening that were looking to be filled on other projects.</p>



<p>We took the decision to redeploy our VR team into those other projects/roles. Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team.</p>



<p>While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position, you would have made the same decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve played a little PowerWash Simulator VR on the Meta Quest 3, and it’s a fantastic experience that’s possibly one of the most therapeutic things I’ve ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The base game was good enough, but VR enabled me to get up close with what I was cleaning – and it helped when it came to detecting those last spots of grime on unseen surfaces.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sledgehammer%E2%80%99s-multiplayer-creative-director-leaves-after-15-years.1081563/</guid>

<p>Sledgehammer Games, one of the key contributing studios at the heart of the Call of Duty franchise, has had a rocky time with the series over the last decade or so. The studio is best known for titles like Advanced Warfare, WWII, and Vanguard, which represents a real mixed bag of Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Sledgehammer’s Greg Reisdorf, who was with the firm for 15 years and rose to the role of Multiplayer Creative Director, revealed he has stepped down from the company.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-whatever-comes-next">Whatever Comes Next</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), Greg Reisdorf wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Friday was my last day at Sledgehammer Games after 15 years. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities and amazing developers I worked with.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then dove deep into the history of Sledgehammer Games, giving up various tidbits and treasures from his time at the company. He revealed he created the iconic sequence where Soap succumbs to his wounds in Modern Warfare 3 (2011). He also mentioned that Advanced Warfare ‘was a challenge – but we made it happen’.</p>



<p>Looking back, Reisdorf suggested that the ‘Pick 13’ loadout model ‘should not have happened’. That’s one of the most divisive topics in the Call of Duty community year on year.</p>



<p>Reisdorf also revealed that he was instrumental in revisiting the MW2 maps in Modern Warfare III (2023). It’s widely considered the worst Call of Duty game to emerge in recent years, but the fan service was nothing short of a treat, and Reisdorf was responsible for many of the easter eggs and smaller details or ‘nods’ for true COD fans.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/gregreisdorf/status/1878849641715753391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full thread of posts by Reisdorf</a> is a veritable treasure trove of memory lane snippets, perfect reading material for the average Call of Duty fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chinese-game-time-limit-regulation-tencent-netease/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-and-netease-bow-to-china-%E2%80%98game-time-limit%E2%80%99-regulations.1081557/</guid>

<p>It was recently announced that Chinese regulators are once again enforcing a ‘game time limit’ across the country as the winter school holiday period approaches. The period, set to run between January 15 and February 14, will see millions of children out of school for a well-deserved break – but their gaming time has been slashed by the government.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that both Tencent and NetEase, two of the largest gaming corporations on the planet, ‘have signalled their adherence’ to the regulations. In the month-long holiday period, youngsters will be permitted to play just 16 hours of video games.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-setting-the-terms">Setting the Terms</h2>



<p>In a report published by the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3294239/chinese-regulators-limit-game-playing-time-kids-15-hours-month-during-school-break?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section">South China Morning Post</a> (and uncovered by Malaysia’s publication, <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/01/14/china-restricts-children-to-15-hours-of-gaming-hours-over-school-holidays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Star</a>), the strict regulations were detailed in full, including what publishers are doing to restrict access to games.</p>



<p>Tencent has agreed on a scheme that will see children (anyone aged under 18) permitted just 15 hours of play between January 13 and February 13. NetEase, the gaming giant behind the recent Marvel Rivals release, will allow 16 hours in the same window.</p>



<p>The regulators have stressed that one hour per day will be allowed on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. This was a concept first set up in 2021, with the Chinese government expressing concerns that young people were spending too much time neck-deep in video games.</p>



<p>When the rules were put in place, more than 200 gaming companies pledged to adhere to the regulations.</p>



<p>This might come as a surprise given that China is one of the biggest consumers of games and the wider gaming industry in the world. Last year, the nation released Black Myth: Wukong, one of the most successful games in years and a rampant performer. </p>



<p>In a scary quote taken from The Star’s report, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tencent said that it has tightened its detection measures to better detect and punish transgressors during the upcoming holiday.</p>



<p>It has also created a ‘risky account database’ which flags adult accounts that may be borrowed by children, requiring facial recognition to verify users.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that anyone over the age of 18 is free to play as many games as they want.</p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is set to be released this week, and it’s already turning heads in previews and early reviews. It’s shaping up to be something special, but for it to arrive, ‘Dynasty Warriors 10’ had to be cancelled.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, senior developers from Koei Tecmo revealed that they were working on a ‘numbered’ Dynasty Warriors game before Origins entered development, but it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-out-of-the-ashes">Out of the Ashes</h2>



<p>In the interview <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/804/G080402/20250107035/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with 4Gamer</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/koei-tecmo-canceled-a-new-dynasty-warriors-game-before-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SiliconEra</a>), Koei Tecmo’s Tomohiko Sho, Mitsuhiro Ohshima, Kazutoshi Sekiguchi, and Masatomo Ohba sat down to talk about Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the next game in the lengthy and storied series.</p>



<p>Opening the discussion, Ohba explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Before Origins, Ohshima and I were working on a so-called ‘phantom numbered title’ with a different concept. The title at that time was an expansion of the direction of ‘Dynasty Warriors 7’ with a stage clear system and many playable generals. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>When 4Gamer asked if that game was ultimately cancelled, Tomohiko Sho, Origins’ producer, confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes. It’s not that what Ohba and Ohshima were making was bad, but as current consoles such as the PlayStation 5 appeared and we continued to verify it internally, we talked about whether we could use these specs to make ‘the best Musou that can be made now’. So, the new Dynasty Warriors we made is Origins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(translation errors may exist)</em></p>



<p>The team went on to explain that the ideas created to power this unknown numbered title weren’t ‘wasted’, and that some of them have been incorporated into Dynasty Warriors: Origins. </p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is set to be released on January 17. Will you be picking up a copy? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
It's been almost exactly a year since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-game-directors-new-studio-confirms-first-project-as-fantasy-rpg-dawnwalker">unveiling</a> of Dawnwalker - the new dark fantasy action-RPG from Rebel Wolves. And if you've been eager to learn more - which would be completely understandable, given the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-director-starts-own-studio-called-rebel-wolves">formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff</a>, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - today's your lucky day. Publisher Namco Bandai has now given a first look at Dawnwalker's world in a four-minute cinematic trailer.
</p>
<p>
Rebel Wolves' debut game is now officially titled The Blood of Dawnwalker, and is described as the first chapter in a "brand-new role-playing saga". It's single-player and open-world, with a "strong focus on story and narrative", casting players as Coen - a "young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night".
</p>
<p>
All this unfolds in a 14th century Europe still reeling from the Black Death - a "moment of weakness" for a decimated humanity that gives the world's long-hidden vampires an opporunity to step out and seize control, with other creatures of the night following their lead. "Legends turn into reality, and history as we know it will never be the same."

<p>
There's not a huge amount of additional detail to be shared right now, but Bandai Namco says players will need to use their skills - combining "vampiric strength with human resolve" - as they embark on a quest to save the ones they love. "Face your foes - be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself," the publisher concludes. "But remember - the real evil may bask in the sun's light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night."

Previously, Rebel Wolves CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> while at CD Projekt - suggested The Blood of Dawnwalker wouldn't "be as gigantic as The Witcher" (instead coming in at around the size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Blood and Wine expansion) but that it could well have a "greater" number of quests. Whether things have changed since then isn't known, but today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsyV7yQIBQ">cinematic reveal trailer</a> ends with the promise that more information will be shared this "summer".
</p>
<p>
Alongside Tomaszkiewicz, Rebel Wolves counts former CD Projekt scribe Jakub Szamałek as its narrative director and main writer, with other team members including design director Daniel Sadowski, animation director Tamara Zawada, art director Bartłomiej Gaweł, CFO Michał Boryka, and studio head Robert Murzynowski - who have collectively worked on games such as Cyberpunk, Thronebreaker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a>, and The Witcher series.

<p>It wouldn’t be a VALORANT offseason for Cloud9 without just a little bit of drama. For the second season in a row, the team made more than one late roster move that caught fans off guard. Now though, the team looks to capitalize on the sophomore season of one of last year’s breakout stars in Francis “OXY” Hoang.</p>



<p>At VCT Americas’ Media Day, C9 coach Ian “Immi” Harding spoke to Insider Gaming about OXY’s year two expectations and the new additions to the roster. He also spoke about the necessary culture shift that C9 needs to reach the next level.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A breakout season for OXY last year. What are you hoping to see him do more of in 2025?</strong></p>



<p>This year we’ve been working on a lot of his teamplay, his comms, him actually saying what he wants to do in a round. He has a really good read on the game, but last year he was still getting used to using his own voice. Discipline as well; when we have those two-man advantages, we don’t want him throwing his life away because he wants to get the clip.</p>



<p>We’ve been working around him a lot, and he’s playing an overall better game right now.</p>

<p><strong>IG: Another new addition is v1c, who had a stellar campaign with Shopify. What about his game did you see that you think will impress on the tier one level?</strong></p>



<p>One of the things I feel we lacked last year was firepower and good attitudes. With him he has a great attitude, and great comms which I didn’t expect when trialing. He mid-rounds, he has great ideas, he always wants to help out the coaching staff, he watches VODs back.</p>



<p>But he can shoot. He can really shoot. Now we have shooters on this team. That was the big thing. For smokes players, it was [between] him and Zander, but we didn’t even get a chance to try out Zander. I think all the players that have come in are helping the coaching staff, whereas last year it wasn’t quite like that; we would bring some ideas and they would just get shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>IG: Were there specific players that weren’t receptive to ideas and weren’t providing enough firepower?</strong></p>



<p>I don’t want to name names, but the team’s the team now. I just think our culture last year, which I can be to blame too as well for, wasn’t the best. And this year this is something we’ve really worked on; myself, Guglielmo “GUGLi” Carraro, and especially Mitchell “mitch” Semago coming in. The culture of the team is much, much stronger and in a better position.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Immi backstage during the 2024 season. Photo by Tina Jo/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>[With mitch], it’s still early days, and we’re still learning a lot about each other, but it’s very good. He’s a similar caller to vanity; he can read the game really well. But the things he brings outside the game: he always wants to work on stuff, he wants to work on fundamentals, he wants to make sure we’re not losing ecos. We’re very in sync with that now. He’s bringing out the best of me and I hope I’m bringing out the good in him too.</p>



<p><strong>IG: It took more than a few dramatic steps to get to this roster you have now. Now that it’s together though, what makes it stand out compared to previous rosters?</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s on the same page. We’re having practice days where we’re getting up at 9 am and we’re not finished until 7 pm just because we talk about everything and we’re making sure we’ve got everything right. Obviously a big factor is that we don’t have that much time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-tejo-in-valorant-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now [a new] agent is coming in</a>.</p>



<p>They just want to win and they’re all young and they’re hungry. And going into the offseason that’s what I wanted: young, hungry players that wanted to win and a leader who would help me set the culture to the way it should be.</p>

Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 brought them together 25 years ago, but their last crossover was in 2003's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/svc-chaos-snk-vs-capcom-review/1900-6110244/" data-ref-id="1900-6110244">SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos</a>. So it's high time for a rematch between Fatal Fury's icon and her counterpart, Chun Li, in Street Fighter 6's first gameplay trailer for Mai.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMPlI_oj2VQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kMPlI_oj2VQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Many of Mai's classic moves remain in her arsenal, but she also seems to have greater control of her fire-infused moves, as well. Mai is so powerful here that she trounces both Chun Li and Ryu when she unleashes her full power. Mai also has a new outfit in addition to her famous red costume.</p><p>As glimpsed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fatal-furys-mai-shiranui-shows-off-her-moves-in-street-fighter-6-teaser/1100-6528272/" data-ref-id="1100-6528272">Mai's teaser trailer</a> last month, her Fatal Fury stage looks like it got an update for her appearance in this game. Although Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smash-bros-ultimate-one-snk-fan-favorite-couldnt-m/1100-6471225/" data-ref-id="1100-6471225">felt that it was inappropriate to add Mai</a> to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-me-and-you-and-ev/1900-6417051/" data-ref-id="1900-6417051">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, she previously made a guest appearance in Namco's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-or-alive-6-review-combat-ready/1900-6417097/" data-ref-id="1900-6417097">Dead or Alive 6</a>.</p><p>Capcom hasn't revealed when Mai will be added to Street Fighter 6 beyond a vague "Winter 2025" release window. Her fellow Fatal Fury fighter, Terry Bogard, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/snks-terry-bogard-and-mai-shiranui-headline-street-fighter-6-year-2-dlc/1100-6524045/" data-ref-id="1100-6524045">was added to Street Fighter 6</a> last year. Both Terry and Mai will also be among the returning fighters in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-makes-a-strong-case-for-the-series-return-after-25-years/1100-6521905/" data-ref-id="1100-6521905">Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves</a> when it hits Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on April 25, 2025.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> and Metal Gear creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is pondering his advancing age again, this time telling fans he "can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", amid confirmation his studio Kojima Productions has now entered "crunch time".
</p>
<p>
Kojima shared his thoughts in a <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1878722221058986139">post on social media</a>, his musings seemingly inspired by a recent purchase of Ridley Scott: A Retrospective. "At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", he wrote. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock.
</p>
<p>
"Even now, at 87," he continued. "Ridley Scott is still active. And back when he was past 60 — my current stage in life — he created the masterpiece 'Gladiator'."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Kojima has spoken publicly about the ramifications of his advancing years. Last February, the 61-year-old game design legend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">admitted</a> his decision to revisit the action-espionage genre that put him on the map - in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">PlayStation 5 game Physint</a> - came after a period of sickness and surgery, followed by thoughts of his own mortality.

<p>
"I was at my lowest and felt like I couldn't go back to making games," Kojima explained at the time. "I wrote a will, too. And in that moment, I realised that people die. But, I turned 60 last year. I'll turn 70 in 10 years. I hope to never retire. Having said that, if the users desire it so much, I thought I should change my priorities a bit. I still want to do new things, but I decided to make an action-espionage game."
</p><p>
Physint, though, is still some considerable way off, with Kojima Productions first needing to get <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On the Beach and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Microsoft-backed OD</a> out the door. Death Stranding 2 is likely the current priority, however, given it's the only game in the studio's slate to have anything close to a release window right now - with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">sequel expected to arrive this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Kojima's musings on his capacity to remain creative follow his announcement last week that Kojima Productions is officially in crunch mode, presumably as development of Death Stranding 2 enters the final straight. "The most demanding period of game development — both physically and mentally — commonly known as 'crunch time'", he <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1877861699409391835">wrote on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording," Kojima continued, "there's an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and non-game-related work. It's incredibly tough."
</p>
<p>
Kojima's schedule is unlikely to clear anytime soon, of course. On top of Death Stranding 2, OD, and Physint, he's also working on a Physint movie, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">heavily involved in a live-action film adaptation of Death Stranding</a> - which is being made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">in partnership with A24</a>.

      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Street Fighter 6 [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a></em> downloadable content guest character Mai from <em>Fatal Fury</em> will launch on February 5, <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> announced. <span id="more-937887"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>As the second guest character in <em>Street Fighter</em> history, players have plenty of reasons to get excited for Mai’s unique moveset inspired by a variety of <a title="Companies > SNK Corporation [407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/snk">SNK</a> classics with the modern touches of <em>Street Fighter 6</em> mechanics. Players will be able to bring the heat with Mai across all three game modes, including Fighting Ground and Battle Hub, as well as checking her out as the newest <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter in World Tour.</p><p>The dazzling Mai also drops with two Outfits. Outfit 1 is reminiscent of her classic style across SNK’s historic <em>Fatal Fury</em> series while Outfit 2 will be themed around her newest look in the upcoming Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Outfit 2 can be acquired via Fighter Coins or maxing out your bond with her in World Tour.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_938132"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the trailer, Mai’s moveset uses a variety of familiar and newer techniques during matches to control her opponents with flaming projectiles, divekicks and more, including:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Kachousen</strong> – Mai throws her fan like a fireball. When used normally, the fan loses to other projectiles and your opponent’s strikes can knock them down. But when you hold down the input, they can no longer be neutralized by strikes. In addition, if the fan hits an opponent, it will pop up and fall down on them for another hit.</li><li><strong>Ryuuenbu</strong> – Spin forward in a fiery blaze for combos or to control space.</li><li><strong>Hissatsu Shinobi Bachi</strong> – Perform a cartwheel and fly towards opponents to elbow them. The <a title="Games > OD [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/od">OD</a> version sends Mai into the air to follow up on the attack or to surprise opponents below.</li><li><strong>Hishou Ryuuenjin</strong> – Mai’s dragon punch, which works as an effective anti-air as she delivers a flying upwards kick bathed in flame.</li><li><strong>Kagerou no Mai </strong>– Mai’s Level 1 Super Art, she sets the immediate vicinity on fire, which can be useful as an anti-air move or combo ender. The move also gives Mai five Flame Stocks which give all of Mai’s special moves and Level 1 and 2 Super Arts special properties.</li><li><strong>Chou Hissatsu Shinobi Bachi</strong> – Mai’s Level 2 Super Art where she rushes forward in a blaze of glory that can get around projectiles.</li><li><strong>Shiranui Ryuu</strong> – Enbu Ada Zakura: Mai’s Level 3 Super Art, she flies like a butterfly and stings like a bee in a series of elegant fan strikes.</li></ul><p>Mai will be ready to spice things up next month for players who own or purchase the Year 2 Character Pass or Year 2 Ultimate Pass, and can also be purchased with Fighter Coins. The wicked M. Bison and easygoing Terry (both available now) will be joined by Mai (February 2025) and Elena (spring 2025) to round out Year 2 of <em>Street Fighter 6.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,647 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,584 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,108 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> vis <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch the gameplay trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-caroline-kwan-california-firefighters-twitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As wildfires rage across southern California, displacing thousands and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-fires-winds-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killing 24</a> as of this publishing, the state draws on the labor of <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5081791-incarcerated-firefighters-join-california-wildfire-battle-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 1,000 incarcerated firefighters</a> to help quell the blaze. Over the weekend, Twitch streamers Hasan Piker and Caroline Kwan <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2350601305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed a crew of those firefighters</a> in person, who revealed, among other things, that they are <a href="https://x.com/HasanabiProd/status/1878270180616200647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hideously underpaid</a> and that simple pleasures like video games help make their lives more bearable. This led to <a href="https://x.com/DmachineXClut/status/1878289541825695920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a call for video game donations</a> from well-meaning Piker fans and collaborators. In the days following, they have “inundated” that specific fire camp, <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/washington-ridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Ridge #44</a>, with video games. But there are still other ways you can help out.</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, a representative of Washington Ridge #44 noted that the streamers’ conversation with incarcerated firefighters had a big impact. The camp is now swimming in games for its PlayStation 4.</p><p>"We've been inundated with calls on that, and we've got all we need here,” the representative told Aftermath. “Donations are always welcome, but be careful as to what type of things are donated to a camp. I mean, ping-pong paddles and pool sticks and stuff like that are fine, but then you get into video games and stuff, and then you get inundated. We don't have the capability or the need for all that stuff."&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Visiting the Prisoners California Uses to Fight Wildfires" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LzipRhzK1c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But Washington Ridge #44 is just one camp, and <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/camps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are 36 in total</a> under the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s umbrella – all of which have contributed at least one strike team to the wildfire-fighting effort, according to the Washington Ridge #44 rep. Aftermath called several to get details on their specific needs.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/alder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alder #20</a> has an Xbox (version unspecified), and a rep added that “We only have so many TVs,” so the camp is “pretty set” on games for now. But, he continued, it’s “one break away from not having one.” He noted, for example, that $7,000 in gym equipment succumbed to the ravages of wear and tear after just a month, so there’s no guarantee that game consoles will remain functional indefinitely. All this in mind, if you’ve got a spare Xbox, feel free to <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/alder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">send it</a>.</p><p>Those incarcerated at <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/deadwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadwood #23</a>, like their counterparts at Washington Ridge #44, have access to a PS4, and they’re “always looking for games,” according to a representative of the facility. The only restriction is that games have to be playable offline. Otherwise, games of any age rating are fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/growlersburg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growlersburg #33</a> is also “good” on games, while <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/norco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norco #0</a> and <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/cuesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuesta #24</a> use a different system than all the other camps, going through the CDCR instead of fielding donations directly. The big takeaway? If you’d like to send your spare games – or anything else – to incarcerated firefighters, call ahead. Each facility has different needs, and you want to be sure your donations are reaching their intended recipients.</p><p>There’s also the option to donate money to incarcerated firefighters either via <a href="https://x.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1878270113637351864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizations like the Anti-Recidivism Coalition</a> or to specific individuals by way of JPAY <a href="https://x.com/kelswizzIe/status/1878517378855915860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you can find their information online</a>. These people are saving lives for pocket change, and yet they face a future in which they might be <a href="https://www.knkx.org/2024-07-05/incarcerated-people-who-helped-fight-wildfires-struggle-to-build-a-career-post-prison" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied a proper, adequately-compensated job</a> doing the exact same thing after they’ve served their time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-magic-presents-spring-flourishes-event-showcases-new-dd-themed-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new draft event for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The event, Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes, will be available in supporting retail stores in April. Participants can obtain new cards featuring characters and artwork from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/earn-d-and-d-themed-promo-cards-with-magic-presents-spring-flourishes" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast explained what players can expect from Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes. The event will take place between April 25 to May 25, in keeping with the Spring title.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-presents-spring-flourishes-evin-and-jurin.jpg?itok=opwySXC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-presents-spring-flourishes-evin-and-jurin.jpg?itok=LB4dNVIa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for the draft event itself, that will depend on the store you visit The draft could use any set; it all depends on what that store has in mind. Either way, you will still draft in pods of eight, then play against your fellow participants.</p>

<p>But the big draw of this event are the promotional <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> cards. Everyone who participates in the event will get a non-foil borderless card of a legendary creature from the world of D&amp;D.</p>

<p>These cards will be quite familiar for those who recall the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> Secret Lair. This is because this draft event is part of the first official Secret Lair test by Wizards of the Coast. Among those creatures is the legendarily large red dragon Themberchaud.</p>

Sometimes, these limited drops feature familiar cards with different names or artwork. But on occasion, a completely unique card is made to better represent the theme of that Secret Lair.</p>

<p>In order to prevent availability issues and mitigate FOMO, Wizards announced their "SLX" program. Under this program, any mechanically unique cards released as part of a Secret Lair will have a counterpart made available. Mechanically the same, but aesthetically different. Furthermore, you can purchase these non-foil cards from your local retail store.</p>

<p>The Magic Presents: Spring Flourish event is the first attempt at this Secret Lair test. So your participation and feedback will ensure whether these kinds of events will continue.</p>

But, because these oddball broadcasts use digital avatars to recreate the actual sporting event, they do provide people with a real-time way to watch said event without actually showing any footage of it. And that means you don’t have to deal with pesky broadcast rights. That leads us to what’s happening in Australia. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-14279287/Why-Australian-Open-live-streaming-alternative-Wii-Tennis-style-broadcast-years-competition.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-14279287/Why-Australian-Open-live-streaming-alternative-Wii-Tennis-style-broadcast-years-competition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to tennis reporter Bastien Fachan</a></span>, that’s why matches of the Australian Open are currently being streamed online in what looks like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BastienFachan/status/1878795279245476198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BastienFachan/status/1878795279245476198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wii Sports </em>Tennis</a></span><em>. </em>(It’s not actually <em>Wii Sports,</em> to be clear.

I’m not entirely sure why all the avatars have such large heads and the balls are so big, perhaps it’s to make it all seem more video-game-y and thus you won’t mind so much when stuff breaks, or maybe it’s just to make it easier to follow. </p><p>Either way, I’ve watched more tennis today than I have in a long time, so it also has the added bonus of making some non-tennis fans like me more likely to watch some of the sport. </p><p>You can find all the digital matches online here on the Australian Open’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel under the “Live” Tab.</a></span> Enjoy watching digital people play tennis, and make sure to read the comments in which random tennis fans arrive to watch a match and discover this bizarre video game simulation instead. </p><figure id="" data-id="4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-recommend-id="image://4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-format="png" data-width="407" data-height="64" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-recommend-id="image://4b468d5d4c2c54803cc65a63463be458" data-format="png" data-width="407" data-height="64" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-recommend-id="image://ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-format="png" data-width="402" data-height="53" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-recommend-id="image://ca9feddad2da658fe5241a273228dbf2" data-format="png" data-width="402" data-height="53" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-recommend-id="image://d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-format="png" data-width="404" data-height="66" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-recommend-id="image://d87d8f2e0773e13786b3b0d2049df254" data-format="png" data-width="404" data-height="66" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rebel Wolves, which is represented by former CD Projekt Red talent, has revealed The Blood of Dawnwalker with a lengthy cinematic trailer and a short gameplay teaser. The trailer was released today, introducing this ‘brand-new role-playing saga’ that begins with this open-world single-player RPG.</p>



<p>The studio is led by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the creative mind who directed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which was released back in 2015. In some of the visual and audio elements of the trailer for The Blood of Dawnwalker, some Witcher-themed inspiration can be detected.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-treading-the-line">Treading the Line</h2>



<p>In the blurb that accompanied the new trailer, Rebel Wolves wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Use your skills and combine vampiric strength with human resolve as you take on a quest to save the ones you love. Face your foes – be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself. </p>



<p>But remember – the real evil may bask in the sun’s light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The trailer showcases brutal combat, with enemies being torn to pieces and even exploded by a gaggle of bloodthirsty and powerful vampires. There’s plenty of emotional, fountains of blood, and a glimpse at a wide, open world with impressive potential.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The team neglected to provide any kind of a release window for the game, but a full gameplay reveal is schedule to take place this summer – potentially at Summer Games Fest.</p>

                <p>Emails are about to be way more interesting. A developer has created a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-6159022/" data-ref-id="1900-6159022">Doom</a> port that can be played within a PDF file on a web browser. Aptly named "doom.pdf," the file allows you to boot up the original game and control the character using your keyboard, following the usual WASD movement scheme, the space bar to shoot, and the numbers one to seven to circle between weapons.</p><p>The developer, who goes by ading.dev, shared some details about the process behind the hilarious project via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ading.dev/post/3lfluu6rw6k2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>. It's a bit on the technical side of things, but the port was possible thanks to PDFs supporting JavaScript. Using Emscripten, a compiler that compiles C and C++ source code to WebAssembly, they compiled Doom to asm.js, a subset of JavaScript. In short, it's how ading.dev got Doom running in a PDF.</p><p>Both input and output are done by manipulating text input fields. If you aren't tech-savvy, don't worry, as you don't need to manually input commands. In order to play the game, all you need is to <a href="https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open doom.pdf</a> and follow the instructions. You can either click on the control layout on screen, or type inside a box to mimick the keyboard controls. If the game doesn't work, make sure that you're opening the PDF in Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome.)</p><p>While doom.pdf is far from the best way to play Id Software's classic shooter, it's a marvel to see the port in action. It's yet the latest example of developers and programming enthusiasts capitalizing on dozens of absurd iterations over the years, including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-doom-running-on-100-pounds-of-moldy-potatoes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">potato-sourced electricity powering a calculator</a>. If you're wondering what the current state of Doom is as a franchise, Doom: The Dark Ages is set to arrive in 2025. In June 2024, developers at Id Software said that Doom 1 and Doom 2 were inspirations for the protagonist's origins in the upcoming entry.

In the wake of the disasters claiming thousands of lives, the decimated human population struggles for survival. It’s a moment of weakness. In Vale Sangora, somewhere in a forgotten corner of the Carpathian Mountains, vampires seize their opportunity to walk out of the shadows, overthrow the feudal lords and claim what they’ve been denied for centuries: freedom, and ultimate power that comes with it.

But the vampires also treat the humans like cattle, and they aren't free to leave the valley. They've just traded their human feudal lords for vampires who took their place.</p><p>The Blood of Dawnwalker doesn't currently have a release date, but the gameplay reveal will arrive this summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fresh details of Bethesda's long-rumoured - but as yet unannounced - Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake have surfaced in a new leak, alongside word it could well be arriving this June.
</p>
<p>
An Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake - supposedly being developed in Unreal Engine 5 - was first rumoured in July 2023, when a former Virtuos employee posted to Reddit claiming it was in the works at the Chinese studio. Curiously, references to an Oblivion <em>remaster</em> then emerged later that year, spotted in an internal Microsoft document from 2020 that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">leaked during the company's court battle with the FTC</a>, lending at least some credence to the earlier claim.
</p>
<p>
But that wasn't the end of it. Earlier this month, a Virtuos technical art director updated their LinkedIn profile to highlight their work on a mysterious "unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake", and now another former employee has - seemingly unintentionally - shared more explicit details of a Virtuos-developed Oblivion remake on their own website.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">reported by MP1st</a>, the unnamed employee - who is said to have worked on the project between 2023 and 2024 - described the game as a "fully remade" version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, developed (as previously rumoured) in Unreal 5. The former Virtuos employee is also said to have referenced six gameplay systems reworked for the remake: stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reaction, and HUD.
</p><p>
The new blocking system, as summarised by MP1st, supposedly takes inspiration from games including Souls-likes, to replace an original system considered too "boring" and "frustrating", while archery has been improved to make it "more playable and modern" in first- and third-person views. The new stamina system, meanwhile, is described as being "less frustrating", with the knockdown that occurs when stamina is depleted now less frequent.
</p>
<p>
As for the Oblivion remake's updated sneaking, it'll apparently feature highlighted Sneak icons and reworked damage calculations, and that's alongside the introduction of hit reactions to improve the response to damage inflicted on the player and NPCs. Additionally, MP1st says the former employee referenced an updated HUD intended to be "easier to understand and more aesthetically appealing to young players."
</p>
<p>
MP1st's report follows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">recent claims by reliable leaker NateTheHate</a> that an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake would be launching this June. Before all that, of course, developer Bethesda will actually need to announce the thing - and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct currently scheduled for next week</a>, an opportunity is looming.
