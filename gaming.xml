			<p>If you're looking to squeeze out every bit of story in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight,</a> then you'll want to make sure to find and read every single note.</p>
<p>These guides will take you through where to find them all across the 14 chapters. Here's where to find all four notes in Chapter 2.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 2</h2>
<p>You won't be near the first of the four notes until you've followed the ghosts to the area with the row of houses. So just follow the linear path the level takes you through until you get to that point.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Weaver's Call</strong> - You'll find this note in the first house on the left, by interacting with the symbol on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Spirits, Speak to Me!</strong> - This note is in the barn, where you'll learn the Strand Pull ability. Once you get up to the ledge to head out of the barn, look to your left before leaping and you'll see a barrel with a note on it. Make sure to grab this one when you get to it, otherwise you'll have to play through the level again if you miss it the first time around.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Please, speak to me...</strong> - After jumping out of the barn where you learn Strand Pull and defeating the enemies you'll run into, there's a note in a hidden area to your left. Before following the ghosts into the cave, look for a bundle of branches beyond the dilapidated wooden fence that will light up when you go near them, indicating that you can use Strand Push to knock them aside. There's a note on a tree stump and a Floof knot waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Stigma and Sorrow</strong> - Once you've entered the cave after the ghosts, this note can be found immediately on your left by interacting with the symbol on the cave wall.</p>
<p>That's where you'll find all the notes in Chapter 2 in South of Midnight. Only 96 more to go from here.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-dev-promises-tons-of-changes-as-steam-reviews-turn-sour.1160352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has announced a sweeping set of changes which appear to be aimed at tackling the game's plummeting Steam review rating.</p>

<p>Right now, the&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-esque action RPG is sitting at a rather uncomfortable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam, with players bemoaning what appears to be a significant drop in the game's pacing. Players refer to the pace as "extremely slow and boring" and "a total slog", among other complaints.</p>

<p>The changes were apparently introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick" rel="nofollow">recent Dawn of the Hunt update</a>, which introduced new classes and gameplay elements, as well as some of the gameplay changes that appear to have proven controversial among players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-mostly-negative-changes-jamanra.jpg?itok=h_GfefW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-mostly-negative-changes-jamanra.jpg?itok=ORYIH8dQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s latest update hasn't exactly proven popular.</figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Grinding Gear Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/497192510562500616" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a sweeping set of changes ostensibly aimed at addressing much of players' criticism. The changes, which the developer says "do not represent a full list" of players' grievances, include buffs to various classes, as well as a number of other gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>Several more changes were also announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/640181878351986722" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earlier today</a>, including many changes to monsters to make them less overwhelming, as well as alterations to bosses, player minions, and more.</p>

<p>Whether or not these changes do anything to alleviate players' ire regarding Dawn of the Hunt remains to be seen, but&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>'s next update drops tomorrow at about 3pm Pacific (that's about 6pm Eastern and around 11pm GMT).</p>




<p>Grinding Gear will doubtless hope that these changes mollify players, especially given that it's put all of its eggs in the&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>basket, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2" rel="nofollow">paused updates to the original game</a> back in January to focus on the sequel.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Full patch notes for the above changes will be available when the update lands tomorrow.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode-pve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-and-darker-season-6-brings-brand-new-pve-mode-and-more.1160349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode-pve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ironmace has released the Season 6 update for PvPvE dungeon-crawler&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, and if you're the kind of player who prefers the PvE part of that equation to the PvP part, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-4" rel="nofollow">seasons</a> of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>have focused on adding features like reworked maps, new bosses, and other tweaks, but this one's bringing a whole new mode in the form of Adventure, which Ironmace describes as "an exciting co-op dungeon-crawling experience".</p>

<p>Essentially, it sounds like Adventure mode removes the PvP component from&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, leaving you and your friends free only to worry about the monsters trying to kill you rather than your fellow adventurers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode.jpg?itok=RZd36rMn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode.jpg?itok=FMp5xByE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker</em>'s Adventure Mode is perfect for conflict-averse players.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just Adventure Mode. Ironmace has also added a number of new monsters and sub-bosses to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, as well as new monster patterns for certain Nightmare enemies.</p>

<p>You'll also find new items in the shop, as well as a whole host of other quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks designed to make the&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>experience a little smoother for everyone.</p>

<p>The full list of changes to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>as part of Season 6 is pretty extensive, but if you'd like to read everything that's new, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2016590/view/587264582368624660" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, it's a multiplayer dungeon-crawler with a focus on both player-versus-player and player-versus-environment combat (although the Adventure Mode removes one part of that gameplay makeup entirely).</p>

<p>The game has been subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-developers-respond-to-dmca-takedown-from-nexon-after-removal-from-steam" rel="nofollow">protracted legal battle</a> between developer Ironmace and Korean publisher Nexon, with the latter alleging that Ironmace essentially stole company secrets for an upcoming game Nexon was working on.</p>

<p>A Korean court recently ruled that Ironmace <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-lawsuit-trade-secret-infringement" rel="nofollow">infringed on Nexon's secrets</a> when making&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, although that ruling also means Ironmace hasn't been found guilty of copyright infringement.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Along with a new season of <em>Black Mirror</em>, Netflix might have just released its most interesting licensed game today. Season 7 of the sc-fi anthology includes an episode called “Plaything,” in which a genius coder in the ‘90s — the same one from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing">interactive “Bandersnatch” episode</a> — creates a new game that’s a little bit like <em>The Sims</em> and a Tamagotchi. The difference is the little creatures you take care of are actually alive, which leads the episode down some dark and surprising paths. And as part of its fledgling gaming initiative, Netflix has released a version of the game from the show for subscribers.</p><p>It’s called <em>Thronglets</em>, and it works like a companion to the episode. You take care of little yellow creatures, known collectively as the throng, by providing food and entertainment, as well as helping out with hygiene. Keep up and they’ll thrive. Don’t and, well, things can get dark. The throng will quickly replicate, and soon you’ll have a huge group to look after. At its core, <em>Thronglets</em> plays like a typical mobile building game. The throng will mine for resources, develop new technologies, and open up new areas for exploration over time. As you progress, you’ll unlock new tools and buildings to speed things up and keep the growing throng happy.</p><p>What makes <em>Thronglets</em> interesting is the meta layer. The creatures are sentient and self-aware, and they will frequently speak directly to you, the player. Sometimes it will be for advice on how to proceed; other times, they will ask existential questions, like what it means to die. This extends to the push notifications, which will often feel threatening or guilt-inducing if you haven’t played for a while. Eventually, <em>Thronglets</em>, like the episode it’s based on, gets pretty dark and surreal.</p><p>Last month, Netflix revealed a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">new, seemingly more focused plan for its gaming efforts</a>, and one of the pillars was mainstream titles based on some of its biggest properties. To date, that hasn’t yielded the most exciting results — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game">see <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, for example</a> — but <em>Thronglets</em> represents something more thoughtful. It’s not just a game based on a show, it’s one that extends that show’s world in interesting ways. As Netflix continues to figure out its place in gaming, <em>Thronglets</em> and its tiny critters could represent a welcome path.</p><div><p>The game is available now for free for subscribers <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Fgame%2F81767501" rel="sponsored">on both iOS and Android</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Switch 2 Edition Carts Will Contain Games and Upgrades, Nintendo Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-edition-carts-will-contain-games-and-upgrades-nintendo-says.1160328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has clarified that Switch 2 Edition cartridges will contain both the original Switch version of the game in question and the Switch 2 upgrade, meaning you won't have to download anything extra to play them.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to Australian Nintendo news platform <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vooks</a>, Nintendo said that physical Switch 2 Edition games will "include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card".</p>

<p>Nintendo goes on to say that "no download code" will be included in Switch 2 Edition packs and that the cartridges therein will be "exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards". Good news if you were hoping to resell your Switch 2 Edition games at some point, or if your internet connection is spotty.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=__wNfzGO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=2EilFBrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several games, like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, will be getting Switch 2 Edition versions with console-specific upgrades.</figcaption></figure><p>Frustratingly, however, Nintendo then says that "some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging" if they choose, and that such releases would contain "no game card".</p>

<p>In essence, then, first-party Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will always contain both the original game and the upgrade code, but that might not be the case for third-party publishers. Caveat emptor, I suppose.</p>

<p>Just in case you've somehow missed the hubbub, the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced in full last week</a>, with a worldwide release date of June 5th and a US price (for now, at least) of $449.99, jumping to $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>Though the console is still on track to launch on June 5th, pre-orders have been delayed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">the US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> due to President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs. Nintendo also appears to be weighing up whether releasing the Switch 2 in China <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">will be worth its while</a>.</p>




<p>Games confirmed to be getting Switch 2 Editions so far include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Not all of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launching alongside the console</a>, though.</p>

But that hasn’t stopped Hollywood or big tech before. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/meta-second-screen-theater-tech-m3gan-rerelease-1236364712/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/meta-second-screen-theater-tech-m3gan-rerelease-1236364712/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On April 9, as reported by <em>Variety</em></a></span>, Meta is launching its new “Movie Mate” technology during a special April 30 screening of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/megan-2-first-trailer-teaser-release-date-scifi-horror-1851774585?_gl=1*1xmi06t*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDIzMTM4My43NS4xLjE3NDQyMzQxNTcuNDguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/megan-2-first-trailer-teaser-release-date-scifi-horror-1851774585?_gl=1*1xmi06t*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDIzMTM4My43NS4xLjE3NDQyMzQxNTcuNDguMC4w"><em>Megan</em></a></span>—the original film, not its forthcoming sequel—as part of horror movie studio Blumhouse’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.creepykingdom.com/post/blumhouse-halfway-to-halloween-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.creepykingdom.com/post/blumhouse-halfway-to-halloween-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halfway to Halloween Film Festival</a></span>.” The new tech will let moviegoers use their mobile phones as a “second screen” while watching <em>Megan </em>in a theater. The idea is that people in the theater will be able to use their phone to chat with a <em>Megan</em>-themed AI chatbot, answer trivia questions, and read behind-the-scenes tidbits. </p><p> I don’t care how much of a boomer this makes me: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-singing-theater-phone-taking-pictures-screen-1851708935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-singing-theater-phone-taking-pictures-screen-1851708935">don’t use your phone in a movie theater</a></span>. If you are worried about an emergency, leave it on buzz and exit the theater before checking your device. Otherwise, mute that shit and enjoy two hours in a dark room separated from the nightmare that is the internet in 2025. </p><p> “The question we always ask ourselves is why can’t every day be Halloween? So Halfway to Halloween brings us one step closer, and I couldn’t be happier that this year we are going nationwide,” said Jason Blum, founder and CEO of Blumhouse, in a statement. “In that same spirit of trying new things, we’re excited to give <em>Megan</em> fans an all-new experience in theaters from the team at Meta.” </p><p>I do find it very funny that Meta and Blumhouse are pitching this tech as “new” despite second screen experiences being a thing that companies tried over a decade ago. Remember Xbox SmartGlass? That was an app you’d open on your tablet or phone and then use while playing games or watching movies on your Xbox One. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsofts-smartglass-is-great-and-i-dont-even-use-it-5961690&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsofts-smartglass-is-great-and-i-dont-even-use-it-5961690">It had some uses</a></span>, but wasn’t really a thing anybody cared about. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184?s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So Xbox killed it and moved on</a></span>.

<p>Marathon developers have confirmed that players will not need a PSN account to play the game on PC and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-doesn-t-require-psn-on-xbox-and-pc">Marathon Doesn’t Require PSN on Xbox and PC</h2>



<p>With Marathon being a Sony-backed project, many players worried they might need a PSN account to play the game on other platforms. However, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> spotted, Bungie has removed these worries through a message on the game’s official Discord channel. The developers have explicitly stated, “Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox.”</p>



<p>Several of PlayStation’s initial releases on PC came with a PSN account requirement. Many might remember the whole <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombing fiasco with Helldivers 2</a> when it was released on Steam in early 2024. Since then, PlayStation has learned that players on other platforms do not wish to use a PSN account and have made the sign-up optional and also tried to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-will-incentive-users-with-psn-accounts-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivise </a>it for their recent releases like The Last of Us 2 Remastered, God of War Ragnarök and more. And now, with the latest confirmation, Marathon can be added to the list of games that don’t require a PSN account.</p>



<p>Marathon has been under wraps since its initial reveal, but players will finally learn more about the game on April 12. Bungie has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-showcase-announced-for-april-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay reveal showcase</a> for their upcoming PvP extraction shooter. In 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively revealed how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the loot system</a> works in the game.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marathon not requiring a PSN account on other platforms? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>The Tomb Raider TV series from Amazon and Phoebe Waller-Bridge looks to no longer be happening.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html">Daily Mail</a> sources, the project is - much like many animals and people that Lara Croft crosses paths with - "dead". </p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to reports that Game of Thrones' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series">Sophie Turner was set to star as the series' globe-trotting lead</a>, a source said that "this is not going ahead".</p>

<p>The Mail's report comes after <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jennifer-salke-steps-down-as-head-of-amazon-mgm-studios-segues-to-producing-with-first-look-deal/ar-AA1BNwen?ocid=BingNewsSerp">Jennifer Salke announced she was stepping down as head of Amazon MGM Studios</a> after seven years. Salke was a driving force behind getting Phoebe Waller-Bridge on board with Amazon.</p>
<p>According to an interview with Puck, and reported by <a href="https://screenrant.com/tomb-raider-show-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-no-script-report/">Screen Rant</a>, Waller-Bridge is yet to even produce a script for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>"Tomb Raider, which Waller-Bridge has been working on and which Salke was personally overseeing after announcing a series pickup last May, has now gone through two writers rooms and tens of millions of dollars in development costs," reads the report.</p>
<p>While things aren't looking promising for Amazon's Tomb Raider series, the company is yet to officially announce the project has been scrapped. Eurogamer has contacted the company for more information.</p>

<p>"If I could tell my teenage self that this was happening, I think she'd explode,"  <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/movies-and-tv/prime-video-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series">said Waller-Bridge at that time</a>. "Tomb Raider has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. </p>
<p>
"Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can't wait to go on this adventure. Bats 'n all."

<p>Along with the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon is also working with Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a>. Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since it was announced. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">being made in Unreal Engine 5</a> and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome".</p>
<p>In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>, but did not elaborate much further than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-sirius-studio</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-announces-sirius-studio.1160277/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-sirius-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Producer Teruyuki Toriyama, who worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake has opened up a brand new studio, and it sounds like he's going big right out of the gate.</p>

<p>According to an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bloodborne-demons-souls-producer-establishes-new-game-company-sirius-studio-following-departure-from-sie-japan-studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Toriyama's new venture will be called Sirius Studio, and it's been opened under the auspices of Osaka's Gz Group, which is usually focused on creating games in the PC and mobile spaces, as well as VR games.</p>

<p>Despite that, Automaton says Toriyama's Sirius Studio will be focusing on making "high-end console" games, as well as VR and XR (virtual and extended reality) titles. Sirius' efforts will span a range of both new and existing IPs as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demons-souls-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-new-studio.jpg?itok=b1M0IGME 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demons-souls-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-new-studio.jpg?itok=5-MKMlV7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Teruyuki Toriyama's name is on games like 2020's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>&nbsp;remake.</figcaption></figure><p>Per Automaton, Toriyama says that it's going to take a while before Sirius Studio is ready to announce its first project, but that the company is looking to start with a major project rather than easing itself in through a smaller effort.</p>

<p>Toriyama's time as a producer with Sony's Japan Studio includes credits on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>(both in its original form and its remade version),&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and the PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Freedom Wars</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">got a remaster earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>He left Japan Studio, as well as Sony as a whole, in 2020, and his former outfit was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2021</a>&nbsp;(which may be a significant contributing factor in the lack of a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake).</p>

            <p>Just in case you were getting anxious about needing a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon - the upcoming reimagined PvP extraction shooter from the Sony-owned Bungie - on PC and Xbox, I have good news - you won't!</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message:</p>
<p>"Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox."</p>

<p>The conversation around the PlayStation Network - which is an online gaming and media content distribution service - kicked off last year, when Sony announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">retroactively making accounts mandatory for Helldivers 2 on PC</a>. At this time, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> publisher said this was all to do with safety and security, adding it was always meant to be a requirement for Helldivers 2 players on PC, but due to issues at launch, linking was made optional for a period of time.</p>
<p>However, the company's decision was met with intense backlash from the community, which included the game getting an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">influx of negative reviews on Steam</a>. Sony ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturned its-then plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on PC</a>, and has since softened its PSN stance further afield.</p>
<p>In January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">Sony announced it was going to be removing those mandated PSN account requirements</a> from a number of its PC releases, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> and The Last of US Part 2 Remastered.</p>
<p>It still wants to give players an incentive to sign up to a PSN account, though. On the PC release of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered earlier this month, the team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-pc-specs-and-features-detailed-as-sony-reiterates-no-psn-account-required">Sony used the promise of 50 in-game points to activate bonus features</a>, along with a new Ellie skin featuring<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion"> Jordan A. Mun's jacket from Naughty Dog's upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> to entice players to login.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unknown if Sony will do something similar to encourage players to use a PSN account while playing Marathon. We have asked PlayStation for a comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 pricing pressure in the United States has eased thanks to the pausing of the tariffs announced last week, and the console will likely be widely available at its announced price when it launches on June 5th.</p>
<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDI2Mzk0NywiZXhwIjoxNzQ0ODY4NzQ3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVUg2WTRUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.ZEIyQWKfjdHBpVs7zO7eZStqT-Y5Xj20QhPKsgOroaw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> suggests there should be more than enough units available to meet demand, as per the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/">company's plans</a>. According to new customs data provided by NBD, Hosiden Corp, one of the three main Nintendo Switch 2 assemblers based in Vietnam, shipped a total of 785,700 units in February, 725,200 of them to the United States in February, more units than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. With the looming threat of the tariffs, Nintendo can focus all the production in Vitenam to the United States, suggesting millions of consoles can be shipped from the country in time for the June launch.</p>
<p>As for how the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 could be impacted by the tariffs after launch, there's more uncertainty. According to Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu, if the tariffs stay at 10%, Nintendo will probably keep the announced $499.99 price and take a hit on the margins, given how the company will want to have a thriving system that could expand its user base and make its diversification strategy centered on its iconic IPs even more successful. If they are raised to 46%, however, the system's price is expected to increase between $50 and $100.</p>
<p>Considering the latest developments, there's a very good chance Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will finally begin in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">United States</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">Canada</a> after having been delayed last week in preparation for its June 5th launch. Not every Nintendo fan in the world, however, will be able to get the system on that day, as it has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">delayed indefinitely in China.</a></p>

            <p>Ubisoft's lawyers have responded to a legal action from players of defunct racing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> by insisting that those players never owned the game in the first place. The players made their lawsuit to complain about the game being made unplayable when servers were shut down last year, but Ubisoft have now responded to argue that the game was only "licensed" to those playing, and players should never have expected the game to be useable in perpetuity. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft's legal team made the argument in <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon">a motion to have the case dismissed</a>, as seen by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"The Crew's ordinary, intended purpose was to provide consumers with a revocable, limited license to access its content pursuant to the unmistakable warnings on the product packaging and Ubisoft's Terms of Use," reads part of the filing. "Plaintiffs received just that for years, and Ubisoft therefore provided The Crew consistent with and fit for its ordinary, advertised purpose."</p>
<p>Ubisoft go on to argue that the game being under a non-permanent licence was clearly stated on some of their packaging. They also say that the statute of limitations to make this sort of complaint is up, and that the shutdown of the game caused no "cognizable injury" and therefore the case should be dismissed by the California district court which is looking at it. The plaintiffs make a counter-argument that some vouchers for the game had an expiry date of "2099", which implies the statute of limitations is not up.</p>
<p>Ubisoft made The Crew unplayable when it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">took the servers offline</a> last year, ending 10 years of support for the open world racing game. It started disappearing from game libraries shortly afterwards, making any hopes of a fan preservation movement (as sometimes happens with defunct MMOs) more unlikely. Eventually, some players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-is-being-sued-over-the-crew-in-a-lawsuit-that-compares-the-server-shutdown-to-a-bumperless-pinball-machine">launched the class-action lawsuit</a> which Ubi are now trying to get dismissed. The plaintiffs are seeking "monetary relief and damages for those impacted by the server shutdown".</p>
<p>It may be a significant legal case in the event it's brought to court proper (although these things are often settled or dismissed before it gets that far). Valve make similar "it's only a license" arguments about all those unplayed JRPGs clogging up your Steam library, and now show <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-now-warn-customers-at-checkout-that-theyre-only-buying-a-digital-license-to-a-game">a more prominent warning</a> that you're actually only buying a digital license when you buy a game on their store. This is also the reason why you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-leave-your-steam-backlog-to-someone-else-in-your-will">won't be able to legally pass on your Steam library</a> after you die in that terrible go-karting accident, at least according to Valve. </p>
<p>Our worries over whether or not you actually own anything you download can be traced back to time immemorial (or at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thought-do-we-own-our-steam-games">back to 2012</a>). And Ubisoft's latest comments are a further digging in of corporate heels on this legality. As for The Crew itself, it was an OK racing game - nothing very special in my book - but I do have fond memories of taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-free-road-trip">a cross-country road trip</a> in the game with Adam (RPS in peace).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A port of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD on Nintendo Switch 2 is still a possibility, despite the original GameCube release being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/">Nintendo Switch Online library.</a></p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KindaFunnyGames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinda Funny Games</a> during last week's press event, which allowed media to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Nintendo SVP Nate Bihldorff revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD could still be released on the new system, as all options are on the table. While the port hasn't been confirmed, it has been highlighted how games being available via the Nintendo Switch Online service hasn't prevented other versions of said games from being released on the original Switch, so there's still hope to see the remaster breaking free from the Wii U captivity it has been since its release.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 Reviews Are In! - Kinda Funny Games Daily 04.08.25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kT1tV6XowUs?start=2477&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, we have been hearing rumors of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD getting ported to Nintendo Switch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/">quite some time</a>, but neither game has ever materialized, leaving fans no other option than playing the Wii U releases. While both games feature plenty of improvements over the original releases, Zelda: Wind Waker HD definitely sports the most significant changes, with plenty of gameplay improvements that make it, together with the enhanced visuals, the definitive way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series to date.</p>

<p>The clip kicks off mid-quest. We're on what looks like a mining planet, all sandstone cliffs and crystalline bunches. Indulging in a little showcasey arsenal appreciation, we admire our knife, a slimy slime pistol, and a glowing Toys R Us does Art Deco Scythe. Art Deco's the theme, actually. We soon approach an open plaza overlooked by a mythologising mural that evokes similar art from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey</a>'s Talos I.</p>
<p>"Everything must become nothing, before it can become everything," blasts a tannoy. Distinctly meaningless middle management motivational slogan tier as far as proclamations of evil go, that, but I don't mind a "we must first punch the world to bits before making it good" villain, done well. We sneak up through the plaza, followed by our companion Aza. She's also a cultist, and she keeps calling the other cultists "traitors". We approach an enemy, select our knife, and Aza says "It's killing time!". That is my third least favourite thing a companion can say, Aza.</p>
<p>We stealth stab one cultist, but their body is immediately spotted by another. No matter! We have guns, grenades, and slo-mo - a combination that makes us too pathologically impatient to wait for grenades to create an honest god-fearing explosion on their own time, and so we shoot ours mid-air. Yep, that'll do it. A bit more shooting, and we're inside.</p>
<p>We follow bloody footprints inside the building until we meet a science lady named Exemplar Foxworth. We can immediately tell she's a science lady because she starts breathlessly babbling calculations, as all good pop culture scientists are contractually obligated to do. Whoa! Slow down there, braniac! Can you say that again….<em>in English!</em> She's been left bleeding out via slapdash exsanguination, but it looks like we either don't have high enough medical skills or a kit to patch her up. Conversational skill checks, check.</p>
<p>She fills you in on the situation. The cult has been going billy bear blood sausage nutso around the facility. "Is there any science around here we use to find and kill them?", asks your companion, quirkaciously. What a delightful whackadoodle whose shtick certainly was not worn out halfway through her very first sentence. Science lady points you to a scanner to locate the invisible cultists. She calls them "visibility impaired".</p>
<p>Sorry. Sorry. Just headbutted my keyboard six times in a row then blacked out for a moment. We pass over some electrified corridors and locate the scanner in another room. It's a mask that, indeed, reveals the cultists through infra-red bug vision. We find a few cultists and whack them with the Toys R Us scythe, which looks nicely chunky. "Homicide always cheers me up!", says Aza, evidently unsatisfied with only coming third on my shit list previously.</p>
<p>We return to science lady for some more advice on opening some doors, solve a lever puzzle, then it's off to locate and kill a cultist named Victor. Before that, we take a quick jaunt to show off killable NPCs by putting an end to science lady's calculations for good. Murderable everyone, check. Murderable everyone as a crowdpleasing feature without the branching quest design that would make that feature interesting to begin with? Unconfirmed!</p>
<p>And that's curtains, or hastily shut blinds anyway. Well! I like the art direction. The melee combat looks neat. But can I bank on these enough to buy me a fresh pair of unground teeth each time a character opens their mouths? Starting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">miss Avowed already, honestly</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><strong>Content Warning: This article includes references to extreme sexual violence, please read on at your own discretion. </strong></p>
<p>Valve has removed a Steam game which contained explicit sexual violence from sale in various countries, including the UK, following media attention. </p>
<p>The Steam page for No Mercy described the game as "a 3D choice-driven adult visual novel with a huge focus on incest and male domination". Gameplay footage seen by Eurogamer included non-consensual sex.</p>
<p>When No Mercy first came to our attention, Eurogamer contacted Valve for comment regarding the game's themes and graphic content, and asked why it had been allowed onto the PC storefront, but we did not hear back. Now, Valve has quietly removed No Mercy from sale in the UK and other countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle berated Valve for allowing No Mercy to be sold. "We expect every one of those [tech] companies to remove content as soon as they possibly can after being made aware of it," Kyle told <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/tech/steam-violent-misogyny-video-game-no-mercy/">LBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-minister-slams-valve-for-explicit-game-promoting-non-consensual-sexual-contact-and-sexual-violence">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). "That's what the law requires, it is what I require as a secretary of state, and it is certainly how we expect platforms who operate and have the privilege of access to British society, and British economy, to do."</p>
<p>While No Mercy's Steam page did warn that the game included violent, graphic imagery and themes, Valve's storefront allows anyone to view product pages by simply inputting a date of birth via a drop-down menu, with no further checks necessary. </p>
<p>The Game Ratings Authority, which administers the PEGI system in the UK, stated "games on Steam can optionally apply for a PEGI age rating via our classification process", however this is "not mandated by the platform" ahead of a game's release on the storefront.</p>
<p>It added the Games Rating Authority had "not classified this game" prior to its release on Steam, and nor had it been requested to do so since.</p>
<p>In an additional statement shared with GamesIndustry.biz, CEO of Women in Games Dr Marie-Claire Isaaman said the organisation was "appalled by recent reports surrounding a Steam game, which encourages players to 'become every woman's worst nightmare' and 'never take no for an answer'."</p>
<p>Isaaman said the availability of games such as No Mercy on Steam was "utterly unacceptable", as it "sends a clear and distressing message: that violence against women is not only tolerable, but playable".</p>
<p>"That message has no place in our industry, our communities, or our society," Isaaman said.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry.biz has also now reported that No Mercy is unavailable for sale in Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has again reached out to Valve for comment on No Mercy, asking why it was ever allowed on Steam, and about its subsequent removal from the platform.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Stellar Crown is back in stock (finally), and Amazon also has the Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection if you're feeling like a true Tera master. Meanwhile, Lenovo quietly dropped Xbox Wireless Controllers to $39.99, and I’m just over here trying to convince myself I <em>don’t</em> need one in every color.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Stellar Crown Boxes and $25 off Xbox Series X/S Controllers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, there’s a new Humble Bundle that looks like someone dumped every neon-drenched game into one lineup, and somehow Fallout fans are getting a $200 Pip-Boy replica that actually works as a clock. It's a chaotic mix of gaming greatness, and I'm into it.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218494"><div id="218494" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this box purely for the overkill. Eighteen booster packs, three promo cards, and enough accessories to make a Magic: The Gathering player cry. Terapagos ex, Lapras ex, and Cinderace ex look gorgeous, and the display-worthy gear (card protector, playmat, deck box) makes this feel like more than just another TCG drop. It’s overstuffed, overpriced, over the top and exactly what I want from a premium Pokémon box.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-stella"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stella">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218495"><div id="218495" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the Stellar Crown ETB is one of the best recent Pokémon releases, and not just because it includes a full-art Noctowl. The sleeves featuring Stellar Form Terapagos are slick, and you get nine booster packs — nine! For under $55, that’s a solid entry point into Scarlet &amp; Violet or just a fun rip session waiting to happen. If you missed the last drop, now’s your shot at redemption.</p></div><p id="neon-lights-game-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Neon Lights Game Bundle">Neon Lights Game Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218496"><div id="218496" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Neon Lights Game Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity Xperience Studios</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle is like a cyberpunk fever dream. Ghostrunner, Neon Abyss, and The Red Strings Club all in one lineup? I don't even care that I’ve already played half of these. For $14, I’ll happily double-dip just to have them in one place. I want more game bundles that feel like a hacker curated them at 3 a.m. while jacked into a mainframe.</p></div><p id="microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller -">Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller - Various Colors</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218497"><div id="218497" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller - Astral Purple</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use Code "SPRINGBACK" More Colors Available</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, Xbox controllers never go on sale when you need one — only when your current one starts drifting mid-match and your rage googling leads you here. $39.99 is a no-brainer price, especially with options like Astral Purple and Deep Pink in stock. I already have two, but I want a third just because Microsoft had the audacity to make them this pretty.</p></div><p id="fallout-pip-boy-die-cast-replica"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fallout - Pip-Boy Die-Cast - Replica">Fallout - Pip-Boy Die-Cast - Replica</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218498"><div id="218498" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout - Pip-Boy Die-Cast - Replica</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, I don't need a $200 Pip-Boy replica with a functioning LCD screen, clock, and radio.

Thirty-six booster packs is a full-on dopamine factory for collectors or anyone building out a Scarlet &amp; Violet deck. You’re getting the Tera Pokémon ex mechanics, fan favorites like Koraidon and Miraidon, and honestly, more chances at pulls than I usually trust myself with. I want this in my cart and hidden from my partner. It’s a big upfront price, but when you break it down, it’s solid value for serious collectors.</p></div><p id="monster-energy-zero-ultra-sugar-fre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Monster Energy Zero Ultra, Sugar Fre">Monster Energy Zero Ultra, Sugar Free Energy Drink, 16 Ounce (Pack of 15)</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218500"><div id="218500" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Energy Zero Ultra, Sugar Free Energy Drink, 16 Ounce (Pack of 15)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Unlock coupon by choosing Subscribe and Save.

Bonus points for the Subscribe &amp; Save option, which is where this deal kicks in.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218398"><div id="218398" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been tracking the <em>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</em> for weeks, and while this <strong>$45.02</strong> price on Amazon is still above the original MSRP of <strong>$26.94</strong>, it’s the most reasonable listing I’ve seen that doesn’t involve a sketchy seller or a mystery warehouse. You get six booster packs from the latest set, which is hard enough to find in stores, and I appreciate not having to overpay a reseller just to get in on the new pulls. For anyone trying to keep up with the expansion, this is as straightforward as it gets.</p></div><p id="iniu-140w-power-bank"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU 140W Power Bank">INIU 140W Power Bank</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218399"><div id="218399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 140W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the <strong>INIU 140W 27,000mAh Power Bank</strong> is the backup battery I actually trust when I know I’ll be away from an outlet for more than a few hours. It’s currently <strong>$74.56</strong>, which isn’t exactly pocket change, but for something that can charge a MacBook Pro or a Steam Deck without breaking a sweat, I’d say it’s well-priced. The digital display is genuinely useful, and having three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) makes it easy to keep everything charged without doing the cable shuffle.</p></div><p id="fallout-lucys-vault-33-backpack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack">Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218400"><div id="218400" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually get excited about merch, but the Fallout – Lucy’s Vault 33 Backpack from the IGN Store actually feels like something I’d use. It’s $199.99, which sounds steep until you realize it’s a legit replica built from the same patterns used on the show. This isn’t a cheap cosplay throw-in, it’s got a full 20L capacity, a 16-inch laptop pocket, and more compartments than I know what to do with. Plus, it comes with that massive yellow fleece blanket for the full Fallout-core vibe. I’m not planning on trekking across a wasteland anytime soon, but it’s good to know the bag is ready just in case.</p></div><p id="iniu-power-bank-20000mah-65w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W">INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218401"><div id="218401" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use on-site coupon for full discount</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">INIU 65W 20,000mAh Power Bank is the one I reach for when I need power without the bulk. It's $39.99 and still strong enough to fast-charge my laptop, but compact enough to throw in a backpack without thinking about it. The extra port flexibility is nice, and the built-in phone stand is one of those small features I didn’t think I’d care about until I started using it constantly. It just does its job well without getting in the way.</p></div><p id="humble-heroines-game-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Humble Heroines Game Bundle">Humble Heroines Game Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218402"><div id="218402" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Heroines Game Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charities Girls Who Code and Girl Make Game Scholarship Fund.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Humble Heroines: Rebels, Curses, and Mystery bundle is exactly the kind of thing I buy and then spend the next six months working through. For $12, you get seven games including Control: Ultimate Edition, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Darksiders III, and a few smaller indie gems that deserve the attention. The lineup is solid, the value is obvious, and part of the money goes to Girls Who Code and Girls Make Games, so I don’t even have to justify it to myself. It’s a good excuse to grab some character-driven games that don’t all feel like the same recycled formula.</p></div><p id="iniu-power-bank-100w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Power Bank 100W">INIU Power Bank 100W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218404"><div id="218404" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Power Bank 100W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up the INIU 100W 25,000mAh Power Bank because I wanted one charger that could handle everything without fuss. For $53.98, I get enough power to charge two larger devices at once, thanks to dual USB-C outputs, and it still recharges fast when it’s drained. It’s well-balanced in size and performance, and I haven’t run into overheating or throttling issues even during heavy use. That’s more than I can say for a few others I’ve retired.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-slim-45w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger, Slim 45W">INIU Portable Charger, Slim 45W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218405"><div id="218405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger, Slim 45W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the INIU Slim 45W 10,000mAh Power Bank with Built-In USB-C Cable It's currently $22.49, but the real win here is the integrated cable. It charges both the power bank and my phone, which is ideal when I want to carry as little as possible. The compact build doesn’t compromise on speed, and I like that I can toss it in a jacket pocket without it feeling like dead weight. It’s simple, efficient, and takes up no mental space.</p></div><p id="asus-rog-cetra-true-wireless-gaming"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless Gaming ">ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless Gaming Headphones</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218329"><div id="218329" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless Gaming Headphones</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve tried more wireless earbuds than I care to admit, but the Cetra lineup actually gets it right for gaming.

The 27-hour battery life doesn’t hurt either, especially for marathon gaming sessions — or, let’s be honest, Netflix binges. Wireless charging is just the lazy cherry on top.</p></div><p id="asus-rog-harpe-gaming-wireless-mouse"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASUS ROG Harpe Gaming Wireless Mouse">ASUS ROG Harpe Gaming Wireless Mouse</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218330"><div id="218330" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASUS ROG Harpe Gaming Wireless Mouse</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This thing weighs 54 grams.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-arent-fans-of-the-pokemon-with-guns-moniker<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think of when you think of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>? Unfortunately for the folks who made it, the answer is pretty likely to immediately be, “Pokemon with guns.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because when the game first exploded into popularity, that’s the shorthand everyone on the internet used for it, likely contributing to its rise thanks to the odd combination of two unlike ideas. Heck, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-snaps-up-pokmon-with-guns-game-palworld-for-game-pass-release-date-confirmed"><u>we at IGN</u></a> are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-insists-that-its-pokmon-with-guns-survival-game-is-not-a-scam"><u>guilty of using the phrase</u></a> too, just like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1008US1008&amp;oq=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMgYIBRBFGEAyBggGEEUYQDIGCAcQRRhA0gEINDU1NGowajSoAgCwAgDxBSg3gEcuecCb&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>everyone else</u></a>. It was convenient and easy for those who had never heard of the game to immediately understand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But according to Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, “Pokemon with guns” was never intended to be the takeaway. In fact, he says that Pocketpair largely doesn’t <em>love</em> the moniker. He said this in a talk at the Game Developers Conference last month, when he discussed the initial rise to fame of Palworld in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We revealed the game to the world in June of 2021, so quite a few years ago. We posted a trailer at what's called Indie Live Expo, which is an indie gaming event in Japan. We showed this off to the Japanese audience initially, we had a really, really good reception. But very quickly, Western media got eyes on this little game, and we were very quickly branded, as early as 2021, as a ‘certain franchise’ plus guns. This would be something that has stuck with us to this very day, despite our best efforts to shake that off.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After his talk, I spoke with Buckley in an interview and asked him to elaborate on this. Buckley responded that Pokemon was never really part of the pitch to begin with. Sure, the development team is largely composed of fans of the game, and they clocked the monster-collecting similarities. But the goal was always to be more like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">ARK: Survival Evolved</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of us are huge ARK people, and our previous game, Craftopia, kind of has some stuff in it that we really loved from ARK and some ideas from ARK,” he said. “So we wanted to just take that and make it bigger. And one of the things about ARK, is that everything’s about the dinosaurs. Some are cute, some are cool. But we wanted to give them more personality, more abilities, more uniqueness. So that was the pitch. The pitch was, let's make something like ARK, but a lot heavier on the automation and each creature's like its own very special thing. And then we show that first trailer, and then this title kind of came out. And no, we weren't super happy about it, but it is what it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Buckley if he thinks the “Pokemon with guns” label helped Palworld become as successful as it was, and he acknowledges it did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I mean, that was big,” he said. “That was definitely a big thing. Dave [Oshry] from New Blood [Interactive, publisher of Dusk, Fallen Aces, and others] messaged us because he trademarked the website, ‘Pokemonwithguns.com’ and stuff. All this kind of stuff happened, and I'm sure that fueled that fire, which is fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But still today, 2025, if people want to say [“Pokemon with guns”], that's fine. But the thing that upsets us, I guess, a little bit, is the people who firmly believe that's what the game actually is. But it's not even remotely like that to play the game. So if you want to say that after playing, that's fine, but we'd rather everyone give it a bit of a chance first.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Buckley also doesn’t feel that Pokemon is even a meaningful source of market competition with Palworld. “I don’t think the audiences cross over that much,” he said, again pointing to ARK as a neater parallel. Even then, though, he doesn’t feel Palworld is fighting with anyone else in particular for an audience of players. Not even Helldivers 2, which he said a “very significant” portion of Palworld players also bought on release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1881483215208329464" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gotten in trouble for ranting about the ‘console wars’ before</u></a>, but I think the competition in games is kind of manufactured for the sake of it,” he said. “Almost like a meta-marketing kind of strategy. I don't really think there is competition in games. I mean, there's so many games right now. How can you be in competition with one or two? It doesn't really make sense anymore. We're just always in competition with the timing [of releases] more than anything, I think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if “Pokemon with guns” is out, what tagline would Buckley have had go viral, if he could have had his way?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I probably would've called it, ‘Palworld: It's Kind of Like ARK if ARK Met Factorio and Happy Tree Friends’ or something like that. That’s how I might’ve said it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I told him it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue the same, to which he agrees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough"><u>Buckley and I also spoke about the</u></a> possibility of Palworld coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-developer-unlikely-to-be-acquired-our-ceo-would-never-allow-it">whether Pocketpair would ever be acquired</a>, and much more in our interview.
