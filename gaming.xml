		<p>Is an Octopath game still an Octopath game if you’re not following eight different protagonists? That’s the question that Octopath 0 immediately had me asking, as it takes a thoroughly different approach to the series’ classically-framed JRPG action. Built on the foundations of mobile title Champions of the Continent, Square Enix has expanded on that game’s prequel setting and story, bringing a fully-fledged console entry to life, albeit one that does several things very differently from the previous two games.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xSyjJSAkWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, you create your own character from the ground up. There’s a decent selection of pixel art poses, hairstyles and voices, though I’d have liked to see a little more variety. There are some unique options here, though, and my favourite choice was being able to create your own favourite food. You select your preferred effect and name the dish, so I will now spend the game eating beef noodles for an attack boost whenever I’m feeling run down. The only problem with this is that I might be constantly hungry in real life.</p>


<p>Aside from that, you also select three personal belongings, each of which might give you some kind of stat boost, or present future opportunities for side quests. A letter you think was given to you by a cat? Consider me intrigued. It all serves to give your hero a little more personality and individuality than you might be expecting, and that can only be a good thing, even if I’m immediately wondering about the loss of those crafted character experiences.</p>


<p>This is the land of Orsterra, a place where legend and history prove to be closely interlinked. Here, the Flamebringer, Aelfric, brought light to the world and sealed away the dark god in the process, but now, evil is once again awakening. For you, however, things begin much more peacefully, awakening, as is so often the case, in a little village in the middle of the countryside.</p>
<p>You’re the child of the Wishvale’s Watch’s leader, son or daughter of Fried, a fearless warrior that everyone in the village looks up to. His presence clearly gives everyone a feeling of safety, and you’re soon competing to become a full member of the watch yourself. The opening couple of hours is spent getting to know the people of Wishvale, your character, and enjoying the idyllic hamlet and the vibrant festival that’s held there. It can’t last, though, and when the soldiers of the Crimson Wings arrive, setting the village ablaze, and murdering your parents, it sets you and your companions on a path into myth and legend.</p>

<p>Octopath 0 continues the series’ visual design feat of tricking your brain into thinking this was what games looked like thirty years ago. It’s clearly not what they looked like, as Octopath 0 is utterly stunning, the HD-2D imagery glistening with a sheen that would make a jeweller blush. There’s something cosy and welcoming about it, with the way lanterns burn with a subdued glow, and snow gently sparkles as it falls, and as seasonal RPGs go, Octopath 0 feels like an ideal candidate for long, wintry nights and wrapping yourself up in a cosy blanket of turn-based combat.</p>
<p>The combat isn’t as gentle as that sounds, or as easy-going as those picturesque visuals would have you believe, and the returning systems from the previous games prove as reliable and engaging as before, rewarding patience and thoughtful timing to inflict the maximum damage on your foes.</p>
<p>You build up your Burst gauge with every standard attack, and as you attack enemies, you move them ever closer to a weakened Break state. The key is biding your time, waiting until enemies are at their weakest, before using your stored-up attacks to unleash a barrage of blows at just the right moment. It felt fantastic in the first two games, and it’s just as enjoyable here.</p>

<p>That journey from a free-to-play mobile title to a full-scale console release is an interesting one. On first impressions, this looks, sounds and feels like a true Octopath title, and shorn of the mobile version’s free-to-play foibles, there’s plenty of encouraging signs that this will be just as impactful as the other entries in the series, especially for fans of classic turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>While there are no longer eight separate characters to work your way through, the number eight still plays a key role, with eight legendary rings to search for, and the ability to take a party of eight into battle – albeit split across two fronts. As we progress further into the game, it’s going to be interesting to see where else the team have worked in the number eight, and whether the overall shift in the series narrative takes away from, or adds to the winning Octopath formula.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ride 6 has been announced by Milestone, with the team aiming to get the game across the finish line and into players’ hands by February 12th. Ride 6 is adding a new Ride Fest career mode, which looks to take some inspiration from the Forza Horizon games, but players will choose from 10 real world racers to compete in the festival, including Casey Stoner, Troy Bayliss and Guy Martin.</p>
<p><iframe title="RIDE6 - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuIfwnu1SeQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ride 6 will have a large roster consisting of 340 motorcycles, though some of these will be part of DLC packages. Those bikes will cover 21 manufacturers and seven categories including Bagger and Maxi Enduro bikes. The game has been developed using Unreal Engine 5 which has allowed Milestone to add in a new dual physics system. This is split between Pro for players who want to get right into the simulation side of Ride 6, and Arcade for players who just want to ride around without having to fiddle too much with different bike parts. The Riding School will allow players to learn different parts of the game and complete challenges, and Ride 6 will also support cross platform play multiplayer. Split screen multiplayer and a race creator are not going to be available at launch for Ride 6, but will come later down the line.</p>
<p>Ride 5 was the last game in the franchise, coming in 2023, but we did not review that. However, Stefan did <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/05/ride-4-review/">review Ride 4</a>, saying, <em>“A fairly well-rounded and solid entry in Milestone’s franchise, Ride 4 makes a similarly well-rounded and solid jump to the new generation. There’s no need to compromise on resolution or performance anymore, with the PS5 able to power the game to look its very best, but it’s really the smart take on how to use the DualSense haptics and adaptive triggers that will enhance how the experience feels.”</em></p>

<p>Ride 6 will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Among the trio of new hardware devices <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">Valve just announced</a> for 2026 – which also include the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> VR headset and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">redesigned Steam Controller</a> – the new Steam Machine is probably the most surprising. Mainly because the original Steam Machines, a series of partner-built SteamOS mini-PCs, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-machines-arent-exactly-flying-off-the-shelves-but-valve-are-sticking-with-linux">sank like rectangular stones</a> upon launching in 2015.</p>
<p>Designed and built entirely in-house, the new model is a very different proposition, though it’s not so much the updated hardware that has Valve believing it’s time to give the Steam Machine another chance. According to engineers Yazan Aldehayyat and Pierre-Loup Griffais, the biggest problem faced by those doomed Machines was one that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-proton-the-reason-most-steam-deck-games-work-has-a-version-100-beta-to-try">Proton software</a> has solved: a lack of SteamOS-compatible games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I think a big part of it was that the software was not quite ready," Aldehayyat replied when I asked what went wrong in 2015. "We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier. So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Proton predates the Steam Deck by a few years, but the handheld was the first major device to show what it could do, allowing punters to play the majority of their already-owned Steam games right out of the box. During the days of the first Steam Machines, the only reliably-running games – unless you got lucky with other, less integrated compatibility tools like Wine – were those that had been manually ported from Windows to Linux, on which SteamOS is based. That meant a relatively tiny library compared to the thousands upon thousands of Steam games that the Deck could run at launch, all without needing any significant input from developers or publishers.</p><p>"Yeah, I think it's really about the games catalogue," Griffais added. "Being able to control your TV, boot directly into the game, launch games and install them in a way that meant you didn't have to install drivers, or that you didn't have to clean up your system after you installed and uninstalled a couple of games... all of those elements were there. We just didn't have a really compelling games library.</p>
<p>"Developers were kind of stuck between the equation of 'Do I want to do a bunch of work to port my game? But there's not an audience for it that justifies this work yet.' So it was a little bit of a bootstrapping problem.</p>
<p>"The catalogue wasn't quite there, but then once we released Proton, we started to see that tendency invert."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>SteamOS still lacks native support for non-Steam launchers like Ubisoft Connect or the Epic Games launcher. But, the Steam Deck has also shown that it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">fairly</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-battlenet-on-steam-deck">easy</a> to get these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">working</a> regardless – in turn, further expanding the new Steam Machine’s compatibility umbrella over games that would never have played ball with the older models. And although an increasingly common blockade for the Steam Deck has been its struggles with squeezing adequate performance out of technically demanding games, Valve are sure that the brawnier Steam Machine won’t fall short on speed.</p><p>"For Steam Deck, we had a lot of work to do on performance, but it was kind of a different angle, right? Like it was power efficiency and stuff like that,” Griffais explained. "So even around the Steam Deck release, if you're running SteamOS on hardware like that, maybe the performance wouldn't be exactly on par as it would be on desktop. But [for the new Steam Machine] we've done a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff, and now we expect that all the same performance advantages are presented in more discrete GPU form factor."</p>
<p>Although I wouldn’t call the Steam Machine a powerhouse, it’s a damn sight quicker than the Deck: while Valve’s engies were telling me all this, I was using it to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> at 4K (upscaled with FSR 3 in Performance mode) on a combination of Medium settings and Low ray tracing. Between Proton and this added muscle, the new Steam Machine might be a few months off, yet it's hard not to agree that it'll likely avoid the compatibility woes that – in Valve’s eyes – doomed its predecessors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Shuhei Yoshida has revealed that two PlayStation projects were cancelled after costing $25 million each; one of them was a new IP game from the developer of God of War. </p>



<p>We have heard about a few cancelled games in recent times, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game screenshots</a> for the scrapped God of War multiplayer title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">images for Rare’s Everwild</a>, comments on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-civil-war-former-actor-reacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Civil War game</a>, and more. Now, Shuhei Yoshida has spoken about PlayStation projects that were cancelled after significant investments. </p>







<h2 id="h-two-playstation-projects-costing-25-million-each-were-cancelled">Two PlayStation Projects Costing $25 Million Each Were Cancelled</h2>



<p>During an appearance on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Plu6ciaLMfso6xWbRqQuz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-recalls-when-he-cancelled-two-25-million-game-projects-including-one-by-god-of-wars-santa-monica-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Shuhei Yoshida opened up about cancelled PlayStation Projects. Yoshida first spoke about the internal game from God of War developer Santa Monica Studios. He confirmed that it was not a God of War game, but a new IP instead, with “a really amazing concept and very interesting gameplay ideas”. </p>



<p>Yoshida revealed that the game was supported for “many years”, but after putting in $25 million, the developers came to him saying, “We have to stop.” He wasn’t able to recall the exact reason for the cancellation, but it was probably because “the team was not able to find the game”. He added that it was a great concept, but “the gameplay didn’t really come to be.”</p>



<p>Shuhei Yoshida then discussed canceling “so many games” that were in early development. With most new games, developers will try a new idea, create a prototype, and if it’s successful, they continue; if not, it has to be reworked or stopped. Hence, early cancellation is not as expensive for them. </p>



<p>However, when projects like the Santa Monica title are progressing well and have had $25 million invested in them, it becomes a “tough decision” to cancel them. But in their case, the developers themselves came and told him, “You know, we probably have to stop.”</p>



<h2 id="h-there-have-been-much-bigger-cancellations">There Have Been “Much Bigger Cancellations” </h2>



<p>Yoshida then spoke about another game “of the same size” that was cancelled. The cancellation occurred when Yoshida was put in charge of Worldwide Studios, where he was overseeing all the games in development. There were many “great projects” from European studios like London Studios, EyeToy, and eventually PSVR and Media Molecule, you know?&nbsp;Guerrilla Games. </p>



<p>However, there was one “big budget project” that didn’t “have the core game” similar to Santa Monica’s cancelled new IP. He added that these were the two large cancellations, “but these days, $25 million cancellation is nothing special. [There are] much bigger cancellations.”</p>



<p>Yoshida also spoke about how difficult it is to cancel games, even when there is a slight chance for the game to “turn around.” However, at the same time, the financial loss could become larger, and the developers could become tired of working on those titles, he explained. Which is why he tries to communicate during every cancellation, not to get stuck on a project, but rather to do “something different, something new, like brand new. So let’s do the fresh restart’.”</p>

<p>The Camo grind in Call of Duty titles is always a popular pasttime, and Zombie players will be relieved to learn that the process has been made slightly easier in Black Ops 7 compared to its predecessor.</p>



<p>While Black Ops 6 required a total of 2,000 Critical Kills to unlock all Military Camos, that amount has been halved in Black Ops 7. However, there’s still plenty to do, with an additional Special Camo available for each weapon.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for all the Camos available in Black Ops 7 from Zombies, or are seeking one in particular, we’ve got you covered with all the challenges to tick off—so bookmark this page for future reference!</p>







<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-zombies-camos-amp-challenges">All Black Ops 7 Zombies Camos &amp; Challenges</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Haunt the undead. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Each weapon in Black Ops 7 has 12 Camos to unlock in Zombies, with nine Military Camos and three Special Camos, with Mastery Camos in addition to those.</strong></p>



<p>Military Camos have the same requirements across all weapons, with some exceptions, while Special Camos have specific challenges that vary per weapon.</p>



<p>Finally, there are also Mastery Camos to earn, which require unlocking all the Camos available on specific guns.</p>



<h3 id="h-all-military-camo-challenges">All Military Camo Challenges</h3>



<p><strong>There are nine Military Camos to earn in Black Ops 7 Zombies, with the requirements being to secure a set amount of Critical Kills with a weapon.</strong></p>



<p>However, there are some exceptions to certain weapon types, as Shotguns require point-blank kills, while both Launchers and Melee weapons require Eliminations.</p>



<p>Each of these Military Camos is available to earn with every weapon in Black Ops 7 Zombies, with similar requirements.</p>

                <p>Five years into the PS5 lifecycle, Sony is confident that the best-selling game of all time for the system has yet to be released. In a new interview, PlayStation's senior VP of marketing, sales, and business operations, Eric Lempel, spoke about how the PS5 era has just started to find its feet, and he has an idea of what the console's biggest-selling game will be.</p><p>"I would say we're really hitting our stride now," Lempel said to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e352emrro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC News</a>. As for the game that will be the PS5's sales juggernaut? "I'm not going to tell you which one, but I think it's still to come," Lempel added.</p><p>In the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-ps5-games/2900-7249/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is currently the best-selling PS5 game</a>, with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 in second place. Several more games are in development for the console, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Marvel's Wolverine</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/" data-ref-id="1100-6529491">Saros</a>. While those games are expected to sell well, it's the upcoming release of GTA 6 that analysts are predicting will be a blockbuster of note. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">Even with it being delayed to November 2026</a>, hype for GTA 6 still remains off the charts. Its predecessor, GTA 5, is the second-best-selling game of all time--220 million units shipped as of November 2025--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-november-2025-include-chilling-horror-and-monster-trucks/2900-7252/">and it'll be coming back to the PS Plus Game Catalog</a> later this month.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/">Lifetime sales of the PS5 have reached 84.2 million consoles sold so far</a>, and Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have only reached the halfway point of its lifespan. Sony's recent investors report also confirmed that Ghost of Yotei has sold 3.3 million copies since launch, but the company has taken a $204 million hit due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-takes-a-204-million-hit-as-destiny-2-falls-short-of-expectations/1100-6536124/">Destiny 2 falling short of sales expectations</a>.</p>

            <p>South Korean publisher Krafton announced it's transforming into an "AI first" company last month, and is now reducing human jobs with a voluntary resignation scheme.</p>
<p>The move comes after the company recorded record-breaking performance in its most recent financial quarter and has announced large-scale investments of over 100 billion won each in the Indian market and AI sectors, as reported by <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette">Business Korea</a>.</p>
<p>The publisher - known for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">inZOI</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> - maintains this scheme is not a layoff plan for workforce reduction. "The core purpose is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation," said a company representative, adding "the company plans to support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">Krafton announced its "AI First" plan back in October</a>. "Starting today, Krafton will automate work centered on agentic AI," said CEO Kim Chang-han. "We will begin in earnest an AI-centered management system where members focus on creative activities and solving complex problems."</p><p>The company is also freezing hiring "excluding organisations developing original intellectual property (IP) and AI-related personnel", as explained by CFO Bae Dong-geun during a recent earnings call, adding "rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level."</p>
<p>The news follows another South Korean developer and publisher, Nexon, whose <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nexon-ceo-believes-its-important-to-assume-that-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-following-arc-raiders-launch">CEO Junghun Lee believes "it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI"</a>. Nexon is the publisher behind Embark Studios' extraction shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, which uses AI for voice work.</p>
<p>It's not just Korean companies, either. According to a report from the organiser behind the Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>NCSoft and Guerrilla Games have made a huge announcement for Horizon fans with the reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers, a MMORPG set in the Horizon universe. Surprisingly, Horizon Steel Frontiers has not been confirmed for PS5, but for PC and mobile only. With the reveal, NCSoft has released two videos for Horizon Steel Frontiers, the first a 10 minute long announcement which delves into what the developers want to with the game, and the second video is a look at the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Horizon Steel Frontiers] Announcement Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bN-NNgWIyIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="[Horizon Steel Frontiers] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Horizon Steel Horizons is set in an area called the Deadlands, a new location that is separate to Aloy’s own adventures which helps NCSoft keep the story separate from the events in the main Horizon games, though I would expect some influence or crossover in due time. The combat in Horizon Steel Horizons will be familiar to how it is in the Horizon games, though players will be working together on large raids to take down the most powerful of the machines. Players will be able to create and customise their own hunter to explore the Deadlands with, and there will be cross platform support between mobile and PC.</p>

<p>A release date for Horizon Steel Horizons has not yet been confirmed by either NCSoft of Guerrilla Games.</p>

<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/news/us/en/patch-note_v110">patch notes</a>
, the "casual" difficulty will be offered as an option when you start both regular and new game plus playthroughs, as well as popping up if you hit game over multiple times on any of the more severe difficulties. Meanwhile, the option to skip the section that begins once you pass through the a door after solving the mural puzzle during a new game plus run is seemingly aimed at new game plus folks who just want to see all of the endings.</p>
<p>If you opt to skip, things'll resume when Hinako awakens at the corridor of the Dark Shrine for the second time, with endings and branching story paths unaffected. Naturally, though, you won't have picked up any items in the skipped bit and three achievements tied to beating the game on different difficulties won't be unlockable for that playthrough.</p>
<p>Dipping into the patch's wider changes, you'll find stuff with similar purposes. The numbers of "unskippable combat encounters" and enemies have been dialled down, while Hinako regenerates stamina more quickly. She'll also take less damage on the hard difficulty and hold off on saying her line after beating a foe for a bit longer.</p><p>Taking a quick peek through the smattering of general bug fixes, "fixed bugs across multiple levels where clumps of flesh do not spawn" is a snigger-worthy one. Those pesky clumps of flesh, not doing what they're told. Shu should also no longer clone himself and monsters shouldn't randomly stop moving as much.</p>

They experienced some Scooby-Doo-style leg spinning, so it sounds like the horror flick at least does well on the zoinks-o-meter.</p>

<p>A new update is out now for Silent Hill f, which adds a new ‘Casual’ difficulty, optional skips for New Game+, and other fixes. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f was released on September 25, 2025 and has been doing quite well for itself, with sales exceeding one million units. Recently, we saw a Switch and previous-gen port <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-switch-and-previous-gen-port-might-have-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly being confirmed</a> for the title; however, there is no official update on it yet. In the meantime, the developers have released a brand new update for the title, which adds new features and addresses some in-game issues. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-f-difficulty-update-biggest-changes">Silent Hill f Difficulty Update Biggest Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first new addition with the Silent Hill F Update is the fresh action difficulty, Casual. Players will be able to choose this difficulty when starting a ‘New Game’ as well as trying out New Game+. Players who already have it on Story action difficulty or higher will see the new difficulty become selectable once they reach the game-over screen multiple times. </p>



<p>The next new feature in this update is optional skips for select sections of New Game+. Once players have installed this update, they will find an option to skip upon completing the “Go through the door” objective after solving the mural puzzle in New Game+. The game will then resume at the scene where Hinako awakens in the corridor of the Dark Shrine for the second time with the “Proceed” objective if skipped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should note that the items that were found in the skipped sections will not be collected. “Thankful to Be Here,” “Grateful for a Worthy Foe,” and “Clear Skies” do not unlock on a playthrough that uses the skip feature. Lastly, this feature will not impact branching paths or endings. Interested readers can check out the system changes and bug fixes in the patch notes below: </p>

<p>ARC Raiders has a fresh new patch ready to be downloaded today, and it introduces the North Line update, the new map (Stella Montis), two new ARC enemies, and <strong>much more</strong>. It also brings about a series of bug fixes and tweaks that address some of the game’s biggest concerns.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out the full ARC Raiders patch notes for the 1.2.0 update.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-patch-addresses-desync">ARC Raiders Patch Addresses Desync</h2>



<p>One of the core elements addressed in the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/north-line-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ARC Raiders patch</a> is desync, which was causing players to look as though they’d been hit by incoming fire even after getting behind cover. Embark Studios has adjusted this, and it should no longer be a concern for players.</p>

<li>Fixed various achievements not working correctly. Players will need to redo some achievements with only one objective item (e.g. “Destroy the Queen”) while achievements with multiple objectives will only need parts of them completed again.</li>

<p>Boasting a rather aesthetic street theme and with endless progression opportunities, this will be a fun experience for anyone who has skateboarded before or even watched legends like Tony Hawk growing up. While simply playing the game will provide players with all the resources they need to get ahead of the competition, some additional free rewards never hurt anybody. That’s where these redeem codes will come in handy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-skateboard-simulator-codes">Expired Skateboard Simulator Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Skateboard Simulator, as the game hasn’t been out for too long. However, one thing worth noting is that since its release, it has had regular content updates, meaning that more codes are likely to drop in due course. With this in mind, players are urged to make use of the active codes at the earliest, as the release of new codes could result in the expiry of the existing ones. Redeem them now so you don’t miss out on the free rewards and fall behind the competition.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Do you like Death Stranding? Do you like anime? Then you’ll be overjoyed at the announcement for Death Stranding Isolations (working title), a new animated series that is coming to Disney+ in 2027.</p>
<p>Announced by Death Stranding’s creator Hideo Kojima and the animated series director Takayuki Sano during the Disney+ Originals Preview event, their creative partnership will broaden the Death Stranding universe in some new directions. The new concept art was created by Ilya Kuvshinov, who served as character designer for “Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045”, with the 2D animation for the full show to be brought to life by E&amp;H production.</p>


<p>It’s the latest in a number of Death Stranding film and TV adaptations that have been greenlit by Kojima and an array of partners. There’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/the-death-stranding-movie-has-a-director/">a Death Stranding movie in the works</a> with A24 and director Michael Sarnoski, there’s also an animated movie, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding-animation-film-announcement">Death Stranding Mosquito</a>, being directed by ABC Animation’s Hiroshi Miyamoto, written by Aaron Guzikowski. Now there’s this streaming series. You can’t really blame Kojima for striking as many deals and partnerships while his stock is so high, with the potential to turn this into a bustling multimedia franchise.</p>
<p>Here’s a little blurb about the story, both for the universe and this new series:</p>
<p>Once, there was an explosion…</p>

<p>Lonesome souls of the dead manifest in the physical world, reaching in search of the living. However, the connection they create triggers a massive explosion that eradicates anything of this world—a phenomenon referred to as the Death Stranding. These events wipe out nations as well as civilization itself. People who remain are now isolated, withdrawn, and without connections. As humanity stands at the brink a legendary porter set out to transport both cargo and wishes of its senders, reconnecting people in the hope that they might still be saved.</p>
<p>Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. An old man trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior who tries to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy with a grudge against Bridges. A girl who embraces loneliness.</p>
<p>On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</p>
<p>And now, comes another explosion…</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach arrived earlier this year to plenty acclaim, much like with the 2019 original. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">our review of Death Stranding 2</a>, Tuffcub said, “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end. The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>

<figure data-uuid="3b741c1e1c313"><a title="Read Dead Redemption" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b741c1e1c313/read-dead-redemption.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Rockstar Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>'s release for the Switch in 2023, a new ESRB rating indicates that the game may soon be receiving a native Switch 2 port.</p>
<p>As detailed on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">ESRB website</a>, Read Dead Redemption has been rated for the PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch 2. The accompanying text naturally details what kind of content is included to warrant the 'Mature 17+' rating, including "Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, and Use of Drugs".</p>
<p>We're not certain what kind of upgrades we'll be getting on the Switch 2, but we would expect to see stable 60fps gameplay along with a pretty sizeable boost in resolution in both docked and handheld modes. Perhaps the multiplayer mode, which was cut from the Switch release, will also make its return here.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnO48QYAS9Kg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9fjxlvmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/red-dead-redemption">review</a> for the Switch release, we awarded it a score of 8/10 and said that Red Dead Redemption is "a proper all-timer ported successfully to Switch and, if you can stump up the cash, you'll have a great time here regardless of the lack of TLC".</p>
<p>Rumours have been circulating for a while now to indicate that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> might also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-port-for-switch-2-really-does-exist-its-claimed">receive a Switch 2 release</a>, but nothing official has been announced yet. The sequel / prequel originally launched in 2018 to critical acclaim and saw players take on the role of gang member Arthur Morgan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar Games' <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA VI</a> has been delayed again, with the highly-anticipated title now launching on 19th November 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-native-releases-are-in-the-works-new-finding-suggests.1352311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Red Dead Redemption may be coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a fresh finding.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the ESRB posted <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">a new rating</a> for the classic Old West open-world game developed by Rockstar Games for the Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo current-generation systems. <span>The rating is unsurprisingly identical to the ones of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39915/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39512/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PlayStation 4,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39439/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;ports, an M for Mature 17+ due to the presence of blood and gore, intense violence, nudity, strong language, and more.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-a-new-port-of-red-dead-redemption">What's The Point of a New Port of Red Dead Redemption?</h2>



<p>Today's rating is somewhat surprising as Red Dead Redemption is already playable on all three systems via backward compatibility. As such, a new native release for current-generation systems can only mean that some new technical features should be included. In regard to content, no surprise should be expected due to the rating summary being identical across all versions of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-red-dead-redemption-be-improved-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-series-x-s">How Can Red Dead Redemption Be Improved on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The new Red Dead Redemption console ports may finally offer 60 FPS and beyond gameplay on all systems.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the game can be played on current-generation consoles via backward compatibility, the experience may not be the best for the most demanding players, as 60 FPS gameplay is only available on PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>PlayStation 4</th><th>Nintendo Switch</th><th>Xbox Series X|S</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1080p (PS4), upscaled to 4K on PS5</td><td>1080p docked / 720p handheld</td><td>1440p on Series S<br>Native 4K on Series X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 FPS (locked), 60 FPS on PlayStation 5</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance Enhancements</strong></td><td>Stable frame pacing, improved texture filtering</td><td>Optimized for handheld and docked play</td><td>Enhanced resolution, improved filtering, Auto-HDR</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">PC port of Red Dead Redemption, on the other hand, is the most advanced</a>, offering up to 144 FPS gameplay, among other improvements that set it decisively above every other version of the game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Red Dead Redemption PC Port Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution Support</strong></td><td>Up to native 4K resolution and ultrawide monitor support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>Up to 144 FPS support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Enhancements</strong></td><td>Improved textures, enhanced shadows, updated anti-aliasing, higher draw distance, and overall graphical refinements, HDR 10 support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Features</strong></td><td>NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.0, DLSS Frame Generation Support</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Considering the PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S have the horsepower to run what's basically an enhanced port of a PS3, Xbox 360 era game at high resolution and framerates, it's very likely the new Red Dead Redemption console ports will attempt to reach parity with the PC version in this regard. </p>



<p>Hopefully, a few more surprises will also be included in this new port, but even without any, improved resolution and framerates should be more than enough to make Red Dead Redemption an enjoyable experience on modern consoles.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-level-unlocks/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the Call of Duty franchise takes center stage in Black Ops 7, which follows the standard approach for the franchise with having a variety of level unlocks to gain access to new weapons, Perks, Scorestreaks, and more.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is making big changes to the formula this year, introducing a four-player co-operative campaign that is followed by a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PvE endgame mode</a>, but there’s still plenty of familiar aspects to the game.</p>



<p>Unlocking the best weapons, Perks, Scorestreaks, and other items in Call of Duty is all part of the journey, and we’ve got details on all the Black Ops 7 level unlocks so you can track your progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-level-unlocks">All Black Ops 7 Level Unlocks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Progression is key. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 55 base levels to work through in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, followed by the customary Prestige system to further enhance your total level.</strong></p>



<p>While some weapons and Perks are available right from the start, the majority are unlocked through progression. However, Progression is universal in Black Ops 7, so you’ll level up whenever you play Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, or Warzone.</p>



<p>The table below showcases every level and what is unlocked by reaching it in Black Ops 7 Zombies. However, some content is only applicable for certain modes, so we’ve separated them out where appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-prestiges-are-in-black-ops-7">How Many Prestiges Are In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 10 levels of Prestige available in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, with the final level, Death, coming alongside an endless amount of levels to churn through.</strong></p>



<p>Prestige Levels 1-9 follow the same process as the standard level-up, earning you unlockables at each level. However, you will receive a Permanent Unlock token after each Prestige, allowing you to choose any weapon, Perk, Equipment, or similar, to remain unlocked, whatever your level.</p>



<p>It’s worth using the Permanent Unlocks on items that are only unlocked in the higher levels of Black Ops 7, or for a weapon that has become your go-to in your chosen game mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Images and information on Ubisoft’s upcoming Far Cry 7 and a separate extraction shooter have leaked online, but dataminers seem to be confused about what exactly they’ve unearthed.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming in 2024</a>, Far Cry 7 was originally under the development name ‘Talisker’, which was subsequently canceled, leading to the creation of two new Far Cry projects: Blackbird, its new mainline title, and Maverick, a new extraction-based shooter.</p>







<p>Some images were described by leakers as being from the Alaskan extraction shooter game, but, in my opinion, those images appear to be jungle-themed, with Maya pyramids found similar to those in the Mexican jungle, not Alaska. That’s because these images originate from project Talisker’s multiplayer mode, which was a team-based elimination-style mode, and is why giant billboards are scattered around the map. Concept art and early in-development images sent to Insider Gaming under the condition that they are not made public match the actual screenshots identically.</p>



<p>As seen in one screenshot we’ve embedded below, a giant rat seems to be pulling a dead player away because Talisker had animals experimented on in the story, which mutated. This story setting will still bleed into the main Far Cry 7 title, but as far as Maverick goes, you’re likely to encounter more realistic animals such as wolves and bears.</p>



<p>That’s, of course, if Maverick doesn’t get canceled, which, at the time of writing, is a possibility. According to sources, the game has struggled to find an engaging gameplay loop, and with constant leadership changes and development issues, the project could be at risk of cancellation. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://t.co/8JXwqqAzNu">https://t.co/8JXwqqAzNu</a></p><p>Far Cry 7 details have reportedly leaked via game files from XDefiant. Fans datamined images showing what appear to be locations from the next Far Cry, strongly suggesting an Alaskan setting, which lines up with previous rumors.</p><p>The leak also seems to… <a href="https://t.co/O1FztPsVxZ">pic.twitter.com/O1FztPsVxZ</a></p></div>— GameGPU (@GameGPU_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameGPU_com/status/1988730314726969477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>One image from the three does stand out from the rest, though: the Beckett family. As reported in the past, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=far+cry+7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7 will have a 24 real-life hours</a> timer (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, who have all been kidnapped. It’s not entirely clear how much this has changed (if at all), but at least at the time of writing, this somewhat controversial gameplay loop is still within the game.</p>







<p>As for who plays the protagonist in the game<span>, it’s currently unclear, as Cill</span>ian Murphy was reported (and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cillian-murphy-far-cry-7-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later debunked</a>) at one point, but I have heard that Kevin Durand (The Strain, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, The Naked Gun) was in the running for the role.</p>



<p>Apparently, these images originate from an old Ubisoft Confluence build, and could be why the screenshots and information are somewhat blurry from the original leakers.</p>

            <p>It's that time of year again. As a new Call of Duty is about to be released, FPS lovers are coming together in a long-lived and important cultural tradition. To play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> early, thousands of fans are digitally migrating to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? Well, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (like many games) doesn't have a unified worldwide release time. The game launches on the 14th November, and thanks to time zones it's playable earliest in New Zealand.</p>
<p>As such, players can hop into their console settings and change their region to New Zealand from the comfort of their home that in reality is thousands of miles away from the idyllic island nation. This lets an eager player easily access the game way earlier than intended, and they can always switch their regions back once the game is fully released worldwide.</p>

<p>This isn't a new phenomenon among Call of Duty players, or in all honestly players of various series which have disjointed global rollouts. It turns out the super-passionate gamer is a migratory bird of sorts, flying their profiles over to the home of the net gun to get some games in before heading home.</p><p>Already on community hubs for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 fans including Reddit, fans are celebrating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1ova8ws/has_everybody_packed_their_bag_for_the_flight/">the incoming New Zealand release</a>. It's a running joke of sorts, with users speaking about these shenanigans as if going on a quick holiday. One user, Sneaky_Demise, wrote: "On my way to the airport now then a nap before midnight once I land".</p>
<p>You may be wondering, is this technique bannable? Well, over the past few Call of Duty games it certainly hasn't been. As long as players don't access the game prior to the New Zealand launch through more nefarious practices, and only start playing alongside their fellow gamers who actually live in New Zealand, it's been an unpunished practice. The New Zealand trick lives in the grey zone between what's allowed and what isn't, and has so far been ignored.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy heading on a quick trip to New Zealand, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-release-times-and-pre-load-dates">you can find the global release times for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> to make sure you're awake for the launch. The game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-xbox-game-pass-games-for-november">also available in November's Game Pass line-up</a>, if you fancied trying it out before paying full price for it.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319">Business Korea</a> and passed along by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-for-employees-as-it-transforms-into-an-ai-first-company/">Automation Media</a>, the redundancy program follows a quarter of record profits. Krafton will dole out severance packages in tiers, with people who've been there one year or less getting six months salary, while those who've been there for over 11 years get 36 months.</p>
<p>According to a company spokesperson, "the core purpose is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation."</p>
<p>Krafton <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company">announced plans to refocus on generative AI for game development</a> in late October. These refocussings include splurging around $20.8 million/30 billion Korean won on retraining the workforce to use generative AI tools, while implementing some kind of automated management system.</p><p>They're also going to spend approximately $69.7 million/100 billion won on a new GPU cluster - that is, a frosty warehouse full of computers with phat graphics cards that pool their might to complete difficult tasks, like patterning a dataset to produce a mean Piña Colada recipe without exhorting the end user to drink sawdust.</p>
<p>Krafton have also announced a hiring freeze across all roles save for those related to developing new intellectual properties or doing things with fancy chatbots, as detailed by CFO Bae Dong-geun in an earnings call on 4th November. The emphasis will be on individual staff being more productive, instead. </p>
<p>"Excluding organizations developing original intellectual property (IP) and AI-related personnel, we have frozen hiring company-wide," Dong-geun said, adding that "rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level, so we are stopping hiring for now, and we will organize and disclose later whether there will be changes to the five-year franchise IP strategy announced earlier this year."</p>
<p>This week, Epic's Tim Sweeney gave <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">an "optimistic" defence of generative AI</a> in response to Eurogamer's unimpressed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> review, arguing that "when tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people." It sort of feels like Krafton timed these announcements to wind him up.</p><p>Generative AI aside, Krafton are slap-bang in the middle of a legal war with ousted Unknown Worlds founders over the quality and release timing of Subnautica 2. I think Brendy and I have basically written a whole book on the subject by now. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">the last news article we wrote</a>, in which Unknown Worlds accuse their old bosses of leaking things to the press.</p>

            <p>Red Dead Redemption has been <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">rated by the ESRB</a> for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, suggesting a remaster is very much on the way.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, the game has been rated M, due to blood and gore, intense violence, strong language and sexual content, and more.</p>
<p>The description also notes gun fights with enemies will include zombies, suggesting the Undead Nightmare expansion will also be included.</p>

<p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-remaster-rumours-swirl">Red Dead Redemption remaster have been swirling for the last couple of years</a>. Originally released on the PS3, Red Dead Redemption is available on the PlayStation Store in its PS4 version - that's playable on PS5, but not fully optimised. Similarly, the original Xbox 360 version of the game is playable on current consoles via backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>This new rating suggests a native current gen version will be on the way. While the ESRB rating doesn't include a release date, its existence suggests it could be available soon.</p>
<p>Back in the summer, rumours circled of a next gen update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> - alongside a Switch 2 port. It's unclear if the sequel is also on the way, or if the two games have been confused in rumours.</p><p>Either way, Take Two CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-switch-2-as-take-two-boss-praises-nintendos-console">Strauss Zelnick praised the Switch 2</a> in a financial briefing back in May. "Historically being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging," he said. "I think Nintendo's been very forthcoming in addressing that, and we're stepping up too because we have great optimism for the platform."</p>

			<p>There’s a deeply rooted part of the human psyche that plans and anticipates the worst things you can imagine. What if, while you’re stood in line waiting for the self checkout, or are sat in a cafe, a fight suddenly breaks out? What would you do?Suddenly you are daydreaming as you imagine the guy in front suddenly charging at you, but you move out of the way so he collides into the person behind you who was about to hit you with a stick. In your head, you can visualise these scenarios and outcomes as much as you want, but in reality you’d only have one shot. Forestrike takes that scenario of imagining fights and puts it in video game form.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forestrike | Gameplay Overview | The Fight Starts November 17" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdWREMaGhJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Forestrike, you play as Yu, who is an apprentice of the ability called Forestrike. The Order of Forestrikers used to be vast, but now it is just you and a handful of old masters imparting their knowledge to you as you go on a quest to save the Emperor and the Empire. The gameplay of Forestrike is built around a roguelite form, where each run offers different abilities to build up Yu to face the different combat puzzles ahead. And while it has all the appearance of a martial arts battler, Forestrike really is at its heart a puzzle game with combat elements.</p>



<p>As you progress through a run, Yu is put into different single scene situations with different enemy types being presented to you. This could range from two enemies up to around six. Yu’s own skills depend on which of the five masters you choose to follow for a run. Taigun, for example, is a master who values using enemy movements against them, encouraging a playstyle where you dodge and have enemies attack each other. Nodai, meanwhile, is much more focused on taking the tactical fight to the enemy, with his path offering a key block ability, and Ogai has the power of the storm on her side, and following her allows you to evade attacks and strike from behind.</p>

<p>While your chosen master gives you the bulk of the abilities on a run, you can pick up techniques from the other masters as you move along the paths, generally if you beat them in a fight. Some abilities will provide additional bonuses with dodging, better blocks, or ways to disarm enemies and cause more damage to them. All of them are reliant on your planning and execution, and that is where Forestrike comes in.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of roguelikes, Forestrike allows you to practice a fight an unlimited number of times using the Forestrike power. When you foresee, you can test out different tactics to take out the enemies you are facing before they take you down. It doesn’t matter if you fail during this, because this is just Yu planning his attack in his mind. You are encouraged to find a tactic and practice it a few times before triggering the actual fight, because if you lose the real fight the run ends and you have to start again without any of your upgrades and abilities.</p>
<p>Some of the fights are relatively simple and may only need one or two practice runs, while others will need a lot of goes before going for the real attack. Even then, success is no guarantee, because a slight deviation from a plan can spell disaster. A misstep here or a rushed attack there may mean you suddenly need to think on your feet to salvage a fight, your best laid plan going right out the window. At other times you will face an impossible fight no matter what, whether that’s down to not having enough health or the wrong mix of abilities to progress. It can be really frustrating to reach those points, as you know the run is over no matter what you do.</p>

<p>Forestrike’s story is pretty run of the mill with a few little mysteries thrown in, but this is ultimately the struggle of a small group of rebels fighting against a powerful foe and their forces. I did like the music in the game as it has that martial arts feel to it, and the pixel art does convey the fight scenes pretty well.</p>
<p>A major issue I had while playing on Switch 2 was the game kept crashing at different times back to the home screen. A day one patch is planned that targets stability and performance, but Forestrike already had the foresight to save between each level, so runs aren’t cut short by crashes.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Forestrike is an entertaining blend of puzzle game and martial arts brawler, allowing you to experiment with different tactics. The different masters also provide variety with ability combinations that make each run unique. Running into some impossible fights that you simply can't beat and the crashing issue on Switch 2 do take some of the shine off the experience, though.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been two years since Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced the Steam Deck OLED</a>, a revision of the handheld gaming device originally released on the market in February 2022. Back then, fans of the device had already been clamoring for a proper, more powerful new iteration, but Valve had just <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-might-not-arrive-until-2025-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that a Steam Deck 2 wouldn't be released until 2025 or 2026 because the technology they were looking for <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-0-doesnt-exist-because-technology-is-not-there-yet-valve-is-working-on-games-designed-for-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was simply not yet available</a>.</p>



<p>The Steam hardware family is officially set to expand early next year with the launch of the Frame headset, the new Steam Machine, and the new Steam Controller; however, there's no new Deck in sight yet. IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked Valve once again</a>, and Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais reiterated that it still isn't time yet, although the company now has a good idea of what it's going to be. </p>



<p><em>Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product. We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SOC landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck. </em></p>



<p>It sounds like we'll have to wait until the latter half of 2027, in all likelihood, which could put the new Deck in direct competition with the PlayStation handheld that Sony is working on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's expected to offer a performance level similar to the base PlayStation 5 console. </p>



<p>Given that both devices will be powered by AMD technology, they could end up with similar performance if they are released near each other at a comparable price. Of course, there are too many unknowns at this point, which is expected given that these devices are a couple of years away. Still, keep following Wccftech to remain updated on the latest leaks, rumors, and news.</p>

            <p>Ah, it's gotten a bit worse. Bethesda are planning to release two patches to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> in order to rectify issues with its anniversary edition, meaning that the potential's there for more havoc to be played with mods. Though, outside of fixes for issues with the revamped Creations menu, it looks like a lot of the contents of these patches may end up being console-specific fixes, so there's a chance any extra PC disruption's relatively minimal.</p>
<p>I'd certainly hope it's less of a palaver than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-script-extender-has-already-gotten-its-anniversary-update-as-bethesda-battle-creation-issues">update's initial arrival</a>, which many modders have been quick to get on top of and push updates for their works.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’re actively investigating issues you’re encountering with the latest Fallout 4 update and Anniversary Edition launch," the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/377160/view/617683464289779908?l=english">Steam post</a> from Bethesda reads. "You should now see faster load times of the Creations menu, game menu, and redemption of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creation-club">Creation Club</a> items."</p>
<p>There's a hotfix coming to the game early next week, which the studio say will put the "issue causing creations that rely on DLC to not work" to bed, as well as a couple of problems specific to Xboxers and PlayStationeers. That ain't it, though. The hotfix'll be followed by two patches, the first arriving the week of November 24th, and the second being more loosely timetabled to rock up in the first half of December.</p><p>Bethesda haven't specified what'll be in either patch yet, with the exception of a boost to local Creations storage on Xbox. Maybe there'll only be one or two tweaks for us PC folk, but the studio not delineating these further patches as console-only suggests there'll at least be something PC-related in 'em. Here's hoping any tweaks are minimal, but even then, such is the nature of game updates that it can only take one bit of code moving or changing to throw a mod out of whack.</p>
<p>So, maybe leave any uber-modded returns to early next year if you want to play it safe in terms of avoiding any headaches.</p>

<p>In our Football Manager 26 review, I said, <em>“Football Manager 26 is the first step of a new era, and as we’re seeing with some of the biggest clubs in the country, any new era comes with the challenge of rebuilding and both setting and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better with updates, but I doubt that this entry will be the one to make the most of the switch to the new engine, overhauled UI and new features. It might take one or two more years for this rebuild to really meet its potential.”</em></p>

		<p>Embark Studios has released the 1.2.0 update for Arc Raiders, naming it North Line, which brings along the new Stella Montis map. Stella Montis is a facility that has lots of blocked up tunnels, but players are being tasked with digging deep into these tunnels to find out what was blocked off and why. In addition to the new map, Arc Raiders update 1.2.0 has fixed issues including players falling through terrain, an issue around missions not completing, and also introduced some balance changes. The full notes are below.</p>

<p>We are drawing ever closer to the release of Dotemu and Tribute Games' next side-scrolling beat 'em up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, on <strong>1st December</strong>, and the devs have returned to give us another deep dive into some gameplay.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/marvel-cosmic-invasion-devs-showcase-every-fighter-in-the-upcoming-beat-em-up">last video of this ilk</a> was all about the diverse character roster, this fresh peek gives us our best look yet at the tag-team-style 'Cosmic Swap' ability, which lets you sub in a new hero at the tap of a button.</p>
<p>We had spotted a bit of this arcade-inspired feature in previous trailers, but it's nice to have the minds behind the game run us through its intricacies.</p>
<p>"Gameplay-wise, the Cosmic Swap is an amazing tool," Game Director Frederic Gemus explains in the vid, "because it not only helps you address different situations with different characters, but also enables you to extend your combos by swapping mid-way and creating these amazing-looking combat sequences, or even just call in an assist so your teammate can take care of an enemy while you're taking care of another one."</p>
<p>It sounds like there's a good layer of depth to it all, too. Whether you want to tackle an enemy from a different angle or plan ahead to achieve a slick combo, the Cosmic Swap ability looks like it'll be something that we'll be using <em>a lot</em> in each and every playthrough.</p>
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion arrives digitally on Switch and Switch 2 next month for <strong>£26.99 / $29.99</strong>.</p>
