			<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake">Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</a> presents one of the series’ strongest instalments for both a new generation of strategy gamer and long-time fans, supercharging the PS2 original with new content and features. For those completely new to ROTK, it’s a grand strategy series that’s been around since the 1980s and takes place during the Three Kingdoms era in Ancient China – around the third century CE – in a time of nationwide turmoil that gives rise to stoic heroes and treacherous villains all vying for power.</p>
<p><iframe title="Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake - Second Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Febv7UPopIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Publisher <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has a well-established affinity for this historic setting. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> – arguably the company’s flagship franchise – is also based on the somewhat fictionalised Romance of the Kingdoms, though it couldn’t be any more different than <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei">Koei’</a>s strategy games. Where Dynasty Warriors focuses purely on high octane, button-bashing action, ROTK immerses players in a dense web of menus and dialogue exchanges that steer you on the path to conquest and unification.</p>


<p>In Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake, you can tackle a number of historic campaigns, selecting from a host of different factions, ranks, and characters to play as. At one end of the scale you can act as a ruler, with full military and political control. At the other end, you can become a free officer who, as the name implies, is free to wander Ancient China, aligning with whoever they wish, or potentially gathering their own army and territories. There are plenty of officer roles that fall in between the two, offering different privileges based on your rank and influence within a faction.</p>


<p>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake is menu-heavy from the word go. That’s pretty much a staple for any game that falls under the grand strategy banner, though thankfully there are plenty of helpful tutorials on hand and Koei does a great job of easing players in without completely bombarding them, gently gesturing in the right direction without any obnoxious guard rails. There are a myriad of moving parts though it won’t take long for lapsed strategy fans and newcomers to get a grip on how everything works.</p>
<p>From slandering a rival officer and hosting banquets to increasing public order, you’ll have a limited number of points to spend on actions per turn. Then, by resting, time will progress to the next month, with each three-month season punctuated by a meeting of parliament (if you are aligned with a ruler). This is where more impactful decisions are made such as forging alliances, conducting espionage, or even marching to battle. These choices are made by high-ranking officers, of course, though even as a small retainer you can still have your say and put your name forward. Saying that, playing ROTK at the bottom of the ladder seems like a strange choice and one that leaves you fairly powerless until you gradually work your way through the ranks.</p>
<p>Compared to more recent entries in the series, ROTK 8 focuses on characters building relationships between one another. Although there’s plenty of planning, and politicising, you’ll spend most of your time simply getting to know your fellow officers, forging bonds that have a multitude of positive effects. Upon meeting certain conditions, you’ll also unlock Tales – character interactions that feed into a bigger, overarching narrative, usually reflecting what happened during specific points in history.</p>

<p>With the game having originally launched in 2001, there has been a significant visual overhaul from top to bottom. For a start, the city and campaign maps are far more dynamic and easier to navigate without shedding their charming ROTK aesthetic. Each officer is brought to life through gorgeous character artwork that transitions into 3D whenever you engage in the Duel and Debate mini-games, adding a welcome layer of immersion.</p>
<p>As for the battle system, there’s nothing overly complex. After deployment, armies will take it in turns to move their units, engage opponents, and activate stratagems. The outcome of most battles can usually be determined by who has the bigger army, though there is scope to tactically outmanoeuvre your foe, making use of the different unit types and arranging them in formations that confer morale bonuses. Table-turning stratagems can also come into play as well as emergent events such as having an enemy general challenge you to a one-on-one duel.</p>
<p>Through achieving dominance, both on and off the battlefield, you’ll eventually expand your territory and solidify an inner circle of confidents including a spouse and sworn siblings. Needless to say, the road to either total conquest or reaching any of the historical campaign victory requirements will take a very, very long time with many meandering paths depending on how you want your story to play out.</p>

                <p>Asus has revealed its new smartphone, the ROG Phone 9. Like the previous models, this is a gaming-centric Android smartphone that packs an impressive amount of technology inside its frame, and Asus says it'll be released on November 19.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4389212-asus-rog-phone-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4389212-asus-rog-phone-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389212"></a><figcaption>Asus ROG Phone 9</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4389212-asus-rog-phone-9.jpg"></figure><p>The new model will be powered by the SnapDragon 8 Elite chipset, and it's one of the first smartphones to utilize this new hardware. This mobile platform also includes a second-generation Qualcomm Oryon CPU and the enhanced Adreno GPU, which theoretically, will make for smooth gaming experiences on the ROG Phone 9. Asus has also confirmed that the phone will continue to have a gamer-centric design, as it showed off a device with sharp angles that match the general aesthetic of other Republic of Gamers devices.</p><p>There's also a dot-matrix display on the rear with this model, which isn't unusual to see on Asus hardware. Several of its ROG laptops sport a customizable panel and Asus also makes a controller that includes a tiny OLED panel that can be used to convey useful information when you're playing games.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple has just released its new line of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-16-has-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-and-native-support-for-aaa-games/1100-6526379/" data-ref-id="1100-6526379"> iPhone 16 smartphones</a>.

The third-party audio tool is built into Black Ops 6's settings menu, and will also be coming to Warzone with Season 1.</p><p>A screenshot of the audio menu was shared by COD content-creator <a href="https://x.com/Omeqa_/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Omeqa</a> on X (formerly Twitter), showing a pop-up offering a free trial for Embody's Immerse spatial audio. The service creates a personalized spatial audio profile based on players' head and ear shape, and costs $20 for five years.</p><p>The paid service is part of the Enhanced Headphone Mode setting, for which a <a href="https://x.com/Omeqa_/status/1848487292010434833" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up screenshot</a> is displayed prominently in the game's audio options. The setting uses a universal profile by default, with the option to pay for a personalized one.</p><p>Black Ops 6 isn't the only game to offer personalized spatial audio through Embody, but it's one of only a few to currently partner with the company. Final Fantasy XIV has offered personalized audio through Embody for a few years, while Cyberpunk 2077 added the option earlier this year.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="450575726" data-promo-id="0"

			<p>A Rayman remake is currently in the works, and members of the recently disbanded Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown development team are said to be working on the game alongside the series' creator, Michel Ancel.</p>
<p>As reported today by&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-remake-team-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, this remake, known internally as Project Steambot, is getting put together by a team located primarily at Ubisoft Milan, the studio behind many successful projects, including the Mario + Rabbids series.&nbsp;<span>Members of the recently&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disbanded Ubisoft Montpellier studio</a>, the team behind the latest entry in the Rayman series, Rayman Origins, and Legends, are part of the development team, and the series creator, Michel Ancel, is also on board as a consultant.</span>&nbsp;His presence, however, is causing concern among the development team members due to his toxic leadership, which came to light in 2020 following the abandoning of the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 development.</p>
<p>As Ubisoft has yet to confirm a Rayman remake is indeed in the works, we have to take everything revealed by Insider Gaming today with a grain of salt. The outlet proved to be extremely reliable in the past, however, so there's a very good chance that the classic platform game series is indeed coming back in the future.</p>
<p>The disbanding of the Ubisoft Montpellier team is definitely disappointing, given how Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is among the best Metroidvania games released in the past few years, but it is good to know that some of its team members are possibly working on this Rayman remake. You can learn more about the team's excellent final game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">review.</a></p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update is now live, introducing Activities improvements, among other things.</p>
<p>The 24.07-10.20.00 system software improves the console's Activities feature. From now on, each activity will display In Progress, Not Started, or Completed, depending on its current status, with spoilers continuing to be hidden even after these changes. The new system software also brings the usual unspecified performance and stability improvements and enhanced messages and usability on some screens.</p>
<p>The previous major PlayStation 5 system software update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">update 24.06</a>, was released last month. It introduced some new features to the system, such as the Welcome hub, personalized 3D audio profiles, Remote Play improvements, and more. The Welcome hub is a personalized space on the console's home screen that can be customized with different widgets that display the console's storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies, and more. The Remote Play improvements include the option to enable Remote Play for select users on the system.</p>
<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 system software update also introduced some changes that impacted several games, such as Final Fantasy XVI, requiring Sony to release another<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-10-01-00/"> firmware update to address the issue.</a></p>
<p>More information on the latest PlayStation 5 system software updates can be found on the console's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-my/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.</p>

It features a variety of mechanics from multiple genres, including base building, exploration, combat, animal taming, multiplayer mode, and more. When offered the chance to get a more in-depth look at the gameplay and learn about the inspiration behind&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>, I jumped at the chance. Though the preview was hands-off, my excitement is piqued and I cannot wait until it launches.</p>
<h2><em>Towers of Aghasba&nbsp;</em>Preview Introduces Exciting Features</h2>
<p>To kick off the preview, Dreamlit Games CEO Khang Le dove into the inspiration behind&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba.</em>&nbsp;Inspired&nbsp;by Studio Ghibli movies, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2f103da7-e1c4-4b2e-b0ff-a20e181b64c1" href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons"><em>A</em><em>nimal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, and various African tribes, the game blends multiplayer cooperation with expansive city building, exploration-driven adventure, and environmental restoration. What you get is a responsive world that differs from other players depending on two key locations.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-colossal-seed-tree.jpg?itok=Yb5M93Gv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-colossal-seed-tree.jpg?itok=kx4Z4e-m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You play as a member of the Shimu people as they return to their ancestral home. Having been promised a paradise, the land is laid barren due to the Withered, a disease that sent your people fleeing from the island years ago. There are pockets of desert where you can build your base, but the most important thing to do is plant a colossal seed.</p>
<p>Unlike most open world crafting games,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;doesn't give you a plethora of resources to harvest at the beginning or your adventure. You have to start restoring the environment if you want materials to craft with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where your island will start to become different from your friends. Depending on the location you plant the seed, the animals that return to the area, as well as the plants that grow, will be different. Plant it near the ocean and you'll get more sea creatures. Plant it at the top of a cliff, you could end up with more birds.</p>
<p>This also gets impacted by the different biomes you grow your seed in. The desert will produce different flora and fauna than a swamp. At the start of Early Access, there will be three biomes to choose your starting location from and restore.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-base-building.jpg?itok=QF-l3r8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-base-building.jpg?itok=xhZe4XLZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thanks to this mechanic, sharing resources with your friends and other players can be extremely important. Trading for materials you don't have available on your island is just one way to utilize multiplayer.</p>
<p>You can also party up and explore Withered areas, which are populated with Withered enemies. These corrupted creatures are aggressive and you can be killed. Adventuring through these zones is the only way to learn the cause of the disease. If you're looking for a relaxing experience, you can visit your friend's islands and go for a tour of their city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another ecological focus of&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is caring for animals and sustainable hunting and gathering. Instead of stockpiling meat, leather, or feathers, there are significant consequences to overhunting a species of animal.</p>
<p>Pushed to the extreme you can cause a creature to go extinct, which impacts the whole ecosystem in that area. Instead, caring for wounded animals, harvesting what you need, and attempting to farm resources in a non-lethal manner are rewarded. There are over 40 creatures that can spawn in your environment and 120 plants that can grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you do have enough materials you can start to build your base. The location you choose can impact what type of city you create, even though there are over 150 decorative elements to choose from. There are different focuses, such as a farming or mining city, that will differentiate your creation from others. While you can put as many crafting items in one place, picking from one of the three types of cities can allow more efficient production.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-withered-combat.jpg?itok=KSNR5wdb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-withered-combat.jpg?itok=xDPPRuSq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It may seem like taming animals, growing plants, and building a city are all there is to do in&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>, but you'd be wrong. There are other activities, like collecting ancient relics, fishing, swimming, and gliding around the world. These are all available at the start of early access, with a roadmap of what's to come in the future becoming available when the game launches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a die hard <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more">survival crafting</a> game fan, I am super excited to get my hands on&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>. Not only is the world gorgeously produced with hand-painted backgrounds, but the unique spin on many of the "expected" survival and base building mechanics has me seriously interested.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see how restoring the world of the Shimu people looks in real time and how these changes can impact other games being developed in the genre.&nbsp;</p>

Reaching out for her thoughts on the experience, I was able to chat with her about <em>Sunderfolk</em>.</p>
<h2>Reinventing Game Night with <em>Sunderfolk</em></h2>
<p><em>Sunderfolk</em>&nbsp;is a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b94efb2d-271e-4538-9184-818a6bdea666" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/in-ttrpg-rolling-dice-or-not-doesnt-matter">TTRPG</a> video game with a fully voiced cast of characters, different classes to pick from, and a focus on storytelling. Developed by Dreamhaven, the studio created by Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime, it's the first internally created title to be announced. The team includes numerous former Blizzard devs, including&nbsp;Chris Sigaty who was the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef33aa60-a7ad-4324-adbf-4ca288d1e741" href="https://techraptor.net/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty"><em>StarCraft II</em></a>&nbsp;executive producer and&nbsp;is heading up the&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em>&nbsp;project.</p>

<p>The dev team isn't the only all star working on&nbsp;the project.&nbsp;Bhimani is a veteran actor with both on screen and voice-over credits. She's deeply committed to the tabletop community. She's played&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>&nbsp;since she was a child with her brother, as well as board games with her family.&nbsp; A regular guest on&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story">Critical Role</a>, she's also a member of DesiQuest, has appeared on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/zac-oyama-talks-fantasy-high-junior-year-gorgugs-development-and-how-elmville-is">Dimension20</a>, and runs her own charity campaign, Puppy Roll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's a connection you can have with people through game playing that doesn't necessarily come in other places."</p>
<p><i>Sunderfolk </i>is&nbsp;not a traditional tabletop game, however. Before diving into the specifics of her role as GM, Bhimani gave me more details on the game itself and how it differs from what's currently on the market.</p>
<p>"The barrier to entry to a lot of TTRPGs is the amount of stuff you have to learn. Trying to bring more friends into that world is sometimes challenging," Bhimani lamented.</p>
<p>Depending on the system, prospective players can spend hours reading lore, learning what different dice rolls mean, creating a character, and actually setting up the space to play. The barrier to entry for many TTRPGs is so high that people don't even bother to learn about another game system, try to find faster ways to play, or continue to show any interest at all in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My feeling, much like what they've done with&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em>,&nbsp;is that as long as you know how to have fun and tell a good story, that should be it. That's all it is, as long as you're there to have a good time and share in this experience with your fellow players."</p>

<p>"I was really, really taken by both the quality of the work they had already put together, even before we started, the deck, and the art. And the deep love that they clearly had, not just for the tabletop community, but for the essence of how gaming brings people together."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This focus on bringing people together for game night to tell a good story is what prompted Bhimani to join&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk&nbsp;</em>as the GM, voicing the narrator for the game as well as all the various NPCs.</p>
<p>"The work I do as an actor has played into that. Also knowing that, much like you'd want to do in a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="ea988cf8-aaa8-4b3e-839c-a01fc3d3270b" href="https://techraptor.net/topic/voice-acting">voice over</a> situation, if I was in an animated series and I was doing all the different voices and it was only audio like a podcast, you would need to hear the difference to know who was talking," Bhimani stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diving in more on&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk </em>itself<em>,</em>&nbsp;there are a number of NPCs that are ready to steal the show. From a button mushroom to Sinclair the mole and Amaia the penguin, there are plenty of characters to interact with in the narrative-heavy game.</p>
<p>The great part is there's no prep, and if your party can't get through a quest or need more time, you can pick the game up right where you left off. It's also child friendly, making it an easy addition to a family game night.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sunderfolk-amaia-dialogue.jpg?itok=wO8eE1OA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sunderfolk-amaia-dialogue.jpg?itok=XytsgDek 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Sunderfolk</em>&nbsp;takes a story and puts it on a shared screen. All the tools needed are at your fingertips on your phone or mobile device. "There's nothing like it, so I don't specifically know what to compare it to," she explained. Once you get your friends and family together, just turn on the game to start adventuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhimani then expanded on the feel of <em>Sunderfolk</em>. "There are sections that will feel a little bit like a storybook that are similar to cutscenes that we see in certain video games. Then there are also sections that are just full-on gameplay grid situations where you will be in battle or encounter of some kind."</p>
<p>The Dreamhaven team have created an access point for many new to TTRPGs that want to learn more about that genre,&nbsp;experience a different kind of game night, or are too busy to put together a campaign.&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk&nbsp;</em>is looking to become a bridge between video game enthusiasts and TTRPG players. With an experienced GM helming the storytelling, it could shake up the industry.</p>
<p>Before wrapping up the interview, I briefly touched on Bhimani's other work, especially her charity efforts with live-play campaigns like Puppy Roll.&nbsp;Puppy Roll is a finalist in the Sustainability, Environment, and Climate category of the Anthem Awards for 2024 due to it raising money for animals.&nbsp;Noting that playing TTRPGs is fun, she also wants to have an additional benefit aside from entertainment.</p>
<p>"When we get a chance to create something that is super fun to watch and to play and to create and we get to make a difference in the world, it's really lovely that that effort has been noticed," Bhimani said.</p>

            <p>
Cast your mind back a month, and you may remember a promising-looking open-world sandbox popping up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">Sony's September PlayStation State of Play</a>. That game was Towers of Aghasba, and it now has an early access release date for PC and PS5: 19th November. 
</p>
<p>A mix of sandbox survival in a land of big beasts, and an overarching quest of refertilising and rebuilding its ruined open world, Towers of Aghasba stood out as offering a larger gameplay arc than simply rubbing a few sticks together and sticking up a couple of wooden shacks. 
</p>
<p>Here, the emphasis is on renewing Aghasba's world (presumably, named Aghasba), returning its dusty ruins to grassy fields and then growing crops or encouraging animal life. You can hunt said animal life for quick rewards, or take the slower, kinder approach and... well, the trailer below shows you getting some kind of colourful hearts in return.</p>
<p>The whole thing looks a treat too, which always helps, even if you can spot its various gameplay influences a mile off. Here's an extended look at what Towers of Aghasba's early access has to offer:</p>

			<p>The Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree expansion has significantly increased publisher Bandai Namco's earnings forecast.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/E_20241023E38080E6A5ADE7B8BEE4BA88E683B3E4BFAEE6AD.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> today by the Japanese publisher today, the success of the expansion of the latest game by FromSoftware and repeat sales of the base game have increased the earnings forecast<br>
for the current fiscal year, with significant increases in sales, operating, recurring, and net profit. The expansion, in particular, is considered to have become a hit in markets worldwide, according to the publisher, while the base game is continuing to perform well.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree has been successful enough to significantly boost its publisher's earnings forecasts. While the expansion is basically just more of the base game, the high quality of the new content makes it a must-have for all those who previously journeyed to The Lands Between, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One worldwide.</p>

<p>It was just yesterday that the news broke regarding the (now former) team working on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. It was claimed that the team had been disbanded and that a sequel pitch for the game had been shot down by Ubisoft, who had reportedly ‘made it clear’ just weeks after the game was released that these very steps would be on the cards.</p>



<p>Now, Insider Gaming is exclusively reporting that former Prince of Persia team members have migrated into another squad – one working on a Rayman Remake. But not all is going well.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-one-to-another">From One to Another</h2>



<p>Per our sources close to the situation, the unannounced Rayman Remake is under development with the codename ‘Project Steambot’, and it’s being pieced together by a team located primarily at Ubisoft Milan. This studio has directly contributed to the creation of more than two dozen Ubisoft games over a twenty-year window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our sources have also confirmed that Michel Ancel, the creator of Rayman (and other franchises like Beyond Good &amp; Evil), is in place as a consultant. This has raised some concerns among team members, least of all because Ancel found himself embroiled in a ‘toxic leadership’ debacle pioneered <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/images/2020/09/25/jeu-video-les-coulisses-effarantes-d-un-blockbuster-geant_1800522/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by a French news outlet in 2020</a>.</p>



<p>That is enough to have cast a less-than-popular light on the Rayman Remake project internally at Ubisoft, even if Ancel is only on board from a consultancy perspective.</p>



<p>It has been estimated that around a dozen developers from the disbanded Prince of Persia team have migrated to work on the Rayman Remake. Elsewhere, other developers have pivoted to work on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 and the next Ghost Recon title.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a Rayman Remake? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-prince-of-persia-devs-move-to-three-new-projects-at-ubisoft.1017069/</guid>

<p>Yesterday, a new rumor revealed that Ubisoft had disbanded its Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team after the game failed to meet internal expectations. It was somewhat of a murky picture as to what actually happened, but Ubisoft has since clarified in a statement confirming some of the details.</p>



<p><span>In a statement to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer</a>, the publisher sa</span>id that the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team has moved on to “other projects that will benefit from their expertise” and that Ubisoft is focused on “making the game available to more players.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the decision to move on from Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and a any potential sequel was made around May of this year and was due to the game missing internal expectations. Sources say that Ubisoft was expecting The Lost Crown to sell similarly to the biggest Metroidvania’s in the market, with millions of units sold in a relatively short space of time. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has sold approximately one million units at the time of writing.</p>



<p>As for which projects Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown developers have joined, it’s understood that the majority have since moved onto three different projects. Most of the team has joined the development of Beyond Good and Evil 2, which was revived internally in 2017. Around a dozen employees have moved to Project Ovr, the next mainline Ghost Recon game. Around a dozen have also moved on to Project Steambot, a Rayman Remake in development at Ubisoft Milan.</p>



<p>Beyond Good and Evil 2 is a project still a few years away, with developers across the entire publisher confused as to why Ubisoft continues to invest tens of millions a year in development, which it’s never likely to get back. Project Steambot has also proved somewhat unpopular internally, as original creator Michal Ancel looms over the project as a consultant.</p>



<p>Developers tell me that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was a “perfect project. ” It was first pitched in June 2020 and saw a relatively straightforward development pipeline, a luxury that most development teams at Ubisoft don’t have. Yet still, Ubisoft’s ridiculously high internal expectations for such a project have once again prevented developers from exploring creative ideas. </p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft moving away from Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and a sequel? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>NCSoft has announced a reorganisation of its projects and staff, resulting in layoffs and the end of several games - including the promising and ultra-realistic-looking thriller Project M.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Korean developer and publisher <a href="https://kr.ncsoft.com/en/pr/newsDetail/5835.do">announced</a> the shift to focusing on four "wholly-owned" subsidiaries. Three of these will act as independent game studios, known as Studios X, Y, and Z. These will be "established to enhance global competitiveness", with a focus on Throne and Liberty, LLL and Tactan.</p>
<p>The fourth subsidiary, known as NC AI, will set its focus on "AI technology development and business expansion", it added.</p>

<p>NCSoft said this "strategic realignment" within the company will result in some "internal reorganisation". This would include ceasing development on certain projects, as well as the "reassignment of internal members and the implementation of a voluntary retirement program".</p>
<p>South Korean news agency <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20241021134500017">Yonhap</a>  (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/throne-and-liberty-and-guild-wars-company-ncsoft-suffers-layoffs-amid-significant-restructure">IGN</a>) said NCSoft co-CEOs Taek-Jin Kim and Byung-Moo Park blamed layoffs at the company on its financial troubles, with the execs apologising to affected staff.</p>
<p>"As a result of operating in a way that most of the manpower and functions are concentrated at the headquarters, financial performance has continued to deteriorate and we are at risk of becoming a chronically loss-making company," the CEOs said, adding the situation "is seriously damaging the creativity and challenging spirit that NCSoft originally possessed".</p>
<p>As for NCSoft's cancelled projects, <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1754249">Game Meca</a> quotes an NCSoft spokesperson as confirming Project M's cancellation, as well as Minibus and Toguri Adventure. Work on its currently-in-service multiplayer game Battle Crush will also come to a close.</p>
<p>NCSoft's four new subsidiaries will be officially established on 1st February next year.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stunning-korean-heavy-rain-like-thriller-is-next-game-from-ncsoft">first got a look at Project M in 2022</a>, with NCSoft revealing a trailer filled with quicktime events reminiscent of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>. Its ultra-realistic graphics immediately caught the attention of many. </p>
<p>However, since then, word on the project has been limited save for an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ncsoft-shows-new-trailers-for-project-m-and-lll">additional trailer released last November</a>. At this time, NCSoft also shared a trailer for LLL, which remains in development. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Move over Hollow Knight," declared Katharine (RPS in peace) in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review</a>, summarising this freshly-honed hunk of POP art as "a deep and challenging Metroid-like with some of the best platforming this side of Moon's Ori games." Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.</p><!--more-->
<p>Find the Gautoz report on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Youtube</a>, which is based on conversations with anonymous developers. Beware that it's in French. And here's Ubisoft's statement in full from the game's senior producer, Abdelhak Elguess.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm extremely proud of our team's work and passion at Ubisoft Montpellier to create a game that resonated with players and critics alike, and I am confident in its long-term success. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now at the end of its Post-Launch roadmap with three free content updates and one DLC that released in September. We are now focusing on making the game available to more players: it was recently launched on Steam, and will be available on Mac by this winter. Most of the team members who worked on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise.</p>
<p>We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft are in a prickly place at the moment. Back in September, one investor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">threatened to organise a rebellion</a> and depose the founding Guillemot brothers in response to disappointing returns on blockbuster games, not least Star Wars Outlaws. Ubisoft subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">kicked back the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows to 2025</a> to avoid another Outlaws-style spongy landing. It's also reported that the Guillemots and Tencent, who are currently minority shareholders, are considering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">buying the company out</a>. All this occurs against the backdrop of labour action, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 staff in France striking in response to a return to the office mandate</a>.</p><p>Taking a longer view, Ubisoft are one among many larger publishers who are struggling to justify smaller, more eccentric projects such as The Lost Crown, which don't aim for the whopping revenues currently expected of the triple-As. As Graham has just lamented to me in our Slack, Ubisoft once had more of a track record for oddball B-listers and smaller artisanal curios - games like Driver, the musically minded Rayman reboots, Mario + Rabbids, and Child Of Light. Nowadays, projects of that scope with relatively modest commercial ambitions don't seem to cut the mustard. </p>
<p>As our guides writer Jeremy added in the same Slack chat, Ubisoft have also really muddled the waters with Prince Of Persia in particular. The Lost Crown has had to compete for attention with another POP side-scroller created by a third-party, Evil Empire's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-a-new-roguelite-that-combines-wall-running-with-arkham-style-agile-combat">The Rogue Prince Of Persia</a>. Like Star Wars Outlaws, it was also exclusive to Ubisoft's own storefront for the first few months of release, reducing the impact of its eventual release on Steam, the largest PC marketplace. Finally, The Lost Crown has had to weather lingering uncertainty about the long-promised, much-delayed Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time remake, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-resurfaces-after-years-of-silence-to-tease-a-release-in-2026">now slated to launch in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
PlayStation 5 will celebrate its fourth birthday in just a few days, and finally there's a native version of Minecraft available for it.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 native version of Minecraft is available now, and comes as a free upgrade from the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/212779">PlayStation Store</a> if you own the game's PS4 version already. As with all other Bedrock versions of the game, this is the cross-platform edition, which lets you play alongside those on PC, mobile, Switch and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
What's new? Well, specifically in the PS5 version, not much. Minecraft fans will be able to take advantage of graphical improvements already found on Xbox Series X, such as 4K visuals and 60fps gameplay.

<p>
Across the Minecraft Bedrock edition generally, today does bring two new features, however. Firstly, a Hardcore mode which limits you to just one life (after which you can only visit your world as a ghost). Second, the ability to bundle different items together in your inventory to save space (in effect, Minecraft has added folders).
</p>
<p>
Minecraft is, of course, owned by Microsoft - which is slowly publishing more of its games on PlayStation consoles. Next up is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">which arrives for PS5 next year</a>.

<p>Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and Pentiment all also made the move across to additional platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, a rumor that The Wolf Among Us 2 had been canceled started spreading on the Web. However, a spokesperson for Telltale Games has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-not-cancelled-telltale-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to Eurogamer that it's not actually true.</p>
<p><em>As a rule, we don't comment on rumors and unsubstantiated Reddit threads. But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we're excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right.</em></p>
<p>Fans had every right to be worried, though. A follow-up to that beloved first season of episodes was first announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2017. However, in September 2018, Telltale<a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> shut down</a> and its projects, including this one, were canceled.</p>
<p>It wasn't long until fans' hopes were rekindled, with the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telltale's resurrection</a> coming in August 2019 and the subsequent confirmation that development on The Wolf Among Us 2 would <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-development-reboot-unreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restart from scratch</a>. The game originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-beyond-2023-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted</a> a 2023 launch, but Telltale delayed it around a year and a half ago to avoid putting too much pressure on its employees with crunch practices. Contextually, we learned that the studio had decided to switch the game to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. The last we heard about The Wolf Among Us 2 was in April when the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-ue5-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first Unreal Engine 5 screenshots.</p>
<p>We don't know a whole lot about the story except for some tidbits that were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-is-set-six-months-after-the-original-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> nearly two years ago. The Wolf Among Us 2 takes place six months after the original season, just after Snow White takes over as deputy mayor of Fabletown. Bigby is still struggling to transition from a typical fairytale villain to sheriff and protector. This new season explores more nuances and difficulties of hiding in plain sight, dealing with mostly new moles, and taking place all over New York, with the city said to play a bigger role.</p>
<p>Telltale also said that it's going to be even more about the human experience of a fable that strips away the fantasy and leaves players with many uncomfortable and messy choices to make.</p>

            <p>I feel this one largely speaks for itself, honestly. I could theorise on the fictional conceit of bringing packaged creatures to life using a microwave and also, sometimes, a blender, but to do so would be to stare into a gift horse’s abyssal oat hole so intently that…</p>
<p>…I was going to finish that with something about its molars staring back, but I had to quickly Google “do horses have molars?” only to misspell it. “Yes, horses can have a strong sense of right and wrong, and what is fair,” went the AI overview. “Some say that horses can teach people to live in the present and to be authentic.”</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>

It is not exactly a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game, but the room in which you select creatures from a vending machine then cook them <em>does </em>feel like the sort of place in which a small slice of horror game could occur.

You’re given orders through a monitor, and you’ll need to read yellowing, crumpled recipes on notepad pages, haphazardly pinned about the room. These three bugs make a snail, these creatures make a frog - horrible chimeric procedures of that nature. I think my favourite thing about it is the vending machine. You can stick me in the most unnatural situation imaginable, and as long as the vending machine is in working order, I’ve at least got some sense of normality. I’ll ignore the fact that the vending machine appears to stock itself.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has responded to a report published yesterday that claimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>'s team had been disbanded.
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer, the Assassin's Creed publisher largely confirmed what had been reported - though made clear that the game's team were still present and busy at development studio Ubisoft Montpellier, albeit now on "other projects that will benefit from their expertise".
</p>
<p>
Yesterday's report by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Origami</a> was not fully clear on the status of the team behind The Lost Crown - which received a positive critical response upon its launch this year, though failed to set tills ringing.

<p>
The report also suggested The Lost Crown would not receieve a sequel as a result of its commercial performance - something Ubisoft does not contradict today - with ideas for a follow-up reportedly merged into plans for the game's DLC.
</p><p>
"I'm extremely proud of our team's work and passion at Ubisoft Montpellier to create a game that resonated with players and critics alike, and I am confident in its long-term success," Abdelhak Elguess, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown senior producer said in a statement to Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now at the end of its Post-Launch roadmap with three free content updates and one DLC that released in September. We are now focusing on making the game available to more players: it was recently launched on Steam, and will be available on Mac by this winter.

</p>
<p>
"We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future."

<p>One of these is, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">Ubisoft's long-awaited Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake</a>, which currently sits with a 2026 release window - some six years after it was initially revealed. </p>
<p>It's unclear which projects at Ubisoft Montpellier the team behind The Lost Crown have joined, though the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-vapourware-it-seems">still toiling on Ubisoft's even-longer awaited Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft ditches its normal formula and finds the ideal way to bring gaming's original Prince back to life," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-fabulous-exploration-and-combat">Eurogamer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/killzone-certainly-sounds-far-from-guerrillas-thoughts-the-themes-of-horizon-are-relatable-for-everyone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been almost eleven years since the last Killzone game was released, and it doesn't look like that will change any time soon. Art Director Roy Postma, a Guerrilla veteran who has worked at the Dutch studio since its foundation, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Washington Post</a> in no uncertain terms that the developer believes Horizon's themes are much more interesting for a bigger audience.</p>
<p><em>We were done with it as a team. As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette. It was, by choice, the opposite of ‘Killzone.’ I think the themes that this story and the characters represent are relatable for all ages and people, like having a found family of friends and finding your place in the world.</em></p>
<p>While there is truth to the assessment, and Horizon has certainly brought much greater success to Guerrilla, Killzone earned its own share of fans, too, over the four mainline installments and two spin-offs developed for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. Its unique 'sci-fi Nazi' setting could have warranted a much greater narrative development than what we've actually seen in the games.</p>
<p>Sony has been very active in remastering its previous games, and it would be interesting to see how many players would get a Killzone: Shadow Fall remaster for PlayStation 5 and PC. The game certainly still looks good to this day and would shine even brighter on the new hardware.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though, Guerrilla is wholly focused on Horizon. They are about to launch LEGO Horizon Adventures, a spin-off action/adventure game targeted at a younger audience. This title, co-developed with Studio Gobo, will be launched right away on PC and Nintendo Switch in addition to PlayStation 5, and there's also cooperative multiplayer for the first time in the franchise (while Guerrilla's bulk is working on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-is-guerrillas-next-big-game-with-horizon-3-a-ways-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-fledged Horizon multiplayer game</a>).</p>
<p>Next week, Nixxes will also release the controversial <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-pay-to-hear-scandal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-%E2%80%98pay-to-hear%E2%80%99-scandal-explained.1017003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-pay-to-hear-scandal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, Call of Duty fans were wrestling with the revelation that they could <strong>pay real-world money in Black Ops 6 </strong>for more effective audio. It was a topic of immediate interest that sent some players into a frenzy, with claims of ‘pay-to-hear’ surfacing across social media.</p>



<p>It’s a little simpler than that, though. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-pay-for-better-audio-in-black-ops-6">Can You Pay For Better Audio in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Okay, yes – you <strong>can </strong>pay for better audio in Black Ops 6, but it’s not as scandalous as it might seem at first blush.</p>



<p>Enter Embody, a ‘personalised spatial audio’ company with a mission to provide you with the best and most accurate ‘3D sound’ possible in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Recently, the company announced a premium offering that would align gamers with a ‘personalised profile’ to the tune of $19.99.</p>



<p>And that’s where the pay-to-hear concept comes from.</p>



<p>Every player accessing Black Ops 6 can access <a href="https://embody.co/pages/cod?currency=GBP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a universal profile build by Embody</a> and leaning on the ‘Immerse Spatial Audio’ system <strong>for free</strong>. It’s as simple as navigating to the sound settings menu in-game and selecting ‘Enhanced Headphone Mode’.</p>



<p>If you’d rather go above and beyond and secure a personalised profile that’s mapped to your physiology, you can pay $19.99 and grab the ‘Immerse Gamepack’. For that transaction, you’ll secure access to Embody’s system for a whopping five years. At $4 a year, that’s not a bad deal, but it’s enough to rub some players the wrong way.</p>



<p>This arrangement is available on Xbox Series XS, PlayStation, and PC (Steam, Battlenet, and Microsoft Store). It’s easier to access on PC platforms, but if you’re on a console, you just need to purchase the add-on in-game.</p>



<p>If it wasn’t already obvious, this is only useful for those playing Black Ops 6 with a headset on.</p>



<p>One of the most talked-about aspects of Black Ops 6 is the reactive, dynamic, and spatial audio. It has been boosted monumentally to allow sounds to adjust based on your local environment, and Embody has been kind enough to give everyone a nice, new profile for free.</p>



<p>It’s up to you if you want to pay $19.99 to get a better experience, of course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-wants-to-grow-throne-and-liberty-into-a-respected-global-ip-but-cancels-two-games-amid-restructuring/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NCSOFT has announced a significant internal restructuring of its studios. The Korean publisher has created four wholly-owned subsidiaries: three independent game studios and a team dedicated to AI development. The three independent game studios are Studio X (the former Throne and Liberty team), Studio Y (which is making <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-shows-stunning-trailers-for-the-division-like-shooter-mmo-and-interactive-narrative-game-at-g-star-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project LLL</a>, an open world MMO shooter reminiscent of The Division), and Studio Z (developer of TACTAN, a strategy game).</p>
<p>NCSOFT mentioned that Throne and Liberty has demonstrated its competitiveness in the global market (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> three million users in its first week when it launched earlier this month) and will grow into a respected global IP with the help of Studio X. Both Project LLL and TACTAN are also believed to have great potential in the global market.</p>
<p>As for the last off-shoot, NC Research is also being spun off into NC AI. This company will specialize in advancing NCSOFT's proprietary AI technologies, including VARCO LLM, and applying these innovations to game development as well as exploring new business opportunities.</p>
<p>It wasn't all good news in the announcement, though. Two games have been canceled: BATTLE CRUSH, a multiplayer action brawler that launched earlier this year on early access for PC, mobile, and Switch, and the interactive narrative game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-announces-project-m-an-interactive-narrative-game-developed-in-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project M</a>, which was highly reminiscent of Quantic Dream's games.&nbsp; As a result, some members of those teams will be reassigned to the remaining studios, while others are expected to leave the company with the newly established voluntary retirement program. NCSOFT has struggled with profitability for a few quarters, partly due to the weak Korean launch of Throne and Liberty; in the last quarter, sales were down 16.1% year-on-year, while operating profit crumbled by 75%. Following this restructuring, the publisher believes efficiency will be improved going forward.</p>
<p>By the way, the four new entities mentioned above will be officially established starting February 1, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/batman-arkham-shadow-review.1016994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">I know what you’re wondering: does the VR Batman game make me <em>feel</em> like Batman? Well, the answer is no. Never once in Batman: Arkham Shadow’s long playtime did I feel like I had a billion dollars, and without that the simulation will never be complete. That said, it did do a remarkably good job of making me feel like I was playing an actual Arkham game by including all of the signature elements of Rocksteady’s legendary series: literally punchy combat, intricate metroidvania-style level design that unlocks more and more as you gain new abilities, and some genuinely tricky optional puzzles. It’s a little clumsy and buggy at times, but enough of it translates well to VR that it’s more like a real game than a gimmick – and the mystery story pays off well without retreading too many of the Arkham series’ plots. And sure, while grabbing at your sides and raising your arms to glide around on your cape may look absolutely absurd to anyone who happens to be in the room with you as you play, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t pretty fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sequel to a prequel is wedged into the space between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review">Arkham Origins</a> (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-blackgate-review">Arkham Origins: Blackgate</a>) and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/11/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Arkham Asylum</a> – a time period where a younger Batman is bluntly but capably voiced by Roger Craig Smith rather than the late, great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kevin-conroy-voice-of-batman-in-animated-series-and-arkham-games-dies-aged-66">Kevin Conroy</a>. After a brief intro sequence in Gotham’s sewers and rubbing elbows with Jim Gordon and a young, one-faced Harvey Dent, we go undercover into Blackgate Prison, where Batman first encounters the likes of Doctors Harlene Quinzel and Jonathan Crane, Arnold Wesker (The Ventriloquist), Barbra Gordon, and a few more. Naturally the developers at Camouflaj can’t help retread things we’ve seen done to death: It wouldn’t really be an Arkham game without a Scarecrow hallucination sequence, for instance – and, of course, we’re treated to yet another reenactment of Crime Alley. However, the new mystery villain known as The Rat King and his populist cult, paired with the over-the-top sadist prison warden Bolton, give Arkham Shadow enough of its own material to work with that it doesn’t feel too derivative.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another novel approach is to have Bruce Wayne visit his makeshift Batcave under Blackgate (like the one under Arkham Asylum) to swap between two costumes. He wears his full Batman regalia by night, but when the Batsuit’s back on the rack he slaps on a Mission: Impossible mask of a two-bit thug named Matches Malone, who’s been thrown in with Gotham’s worst for petty arson. There’s some gadget-less prison yard brawling to be done as Malone, but these sections are much more about ingratiating yourself to incarcerated mob boss Carmine Falcone and the other prisoners, and getting the lay of the maze-like prison yard as the days tick down to The Rat King’s grand plan. I won’t say I wasn’t eager to put the cape and cowl back on by the end of each session as Matches, but the change of pace and perspective isn’t unwelcome considering that there’s only so much variety one can find within the walls and absurdly high-tech doors of a prison, and the dark caverns below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, despite this running on a tiny machine that’s strapped to your face, Arkham Shadow is easily on par with Arkham Asylum as it looked on the Xbox 360 in terms of its character models and textures (and obviously running at a much higher resolution and frame rate), if not quite up to that level of art direction or the scale of its open areas. Of course, that’s an extremely high bar, to be fair. It’s certainly the best-looking Quest-exclusive game I’ve played, likely because it’s exclusive to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3/3S</a> and doesn’t have to compromise for compatibility with older models. Glimpsing my bat-eared shadow as I walked down a hall or glided around with a light behind me was always a treat. Those heavy doors do often take a while to open, though, since they’re masking a lot of loading of the new area you’re traveling to. And be ready to recharge your Quest 3 four or five times to get through Arkham Shadow’s story, which can run 10 hours if you’re not stopping to smell the many Rat puzzles along the way. (It’s probably good to come up for air after a couple of hours in VR, anyway.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The fact that you’re usually being circled by several other thugs means you have to work fast to put an enemy down.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Brawling works surprisingly well and, after things ramped up a bit to introduce enemies with armor, stun batons, shields, knives, and guns, most requiring different takedown moves, I was working up a sweat throwing physical punches that do more damage if you swing like you mean it. Here it’s less about timing punches and more about pausing for a split second after the first smack – which can send you lunging about 10 feet toward a target – to see which sequence randomly opens up: sometimes you’ll do a right, a left, or a gut-punch, others you’ll have three spots to jab at, or sometimes you’ll grab a leg and be prompted to snap it like a twig. It occasionally interprets a swing from the side as a straight-on punch or vice versa, but otherwise it’s pretty satisfying. That’s enough to keep it from being mindless flailing, but the fact that you’re usually being circled by several other thugs means you have to work fast to put an enemy down before you see an incoming attack icon in your peripheral vision and have to detour to block it with a Michael Keaton-esque no-look punch to the side, which pulls you to a different target, so the pressure is on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certain enemies need to be staggered before you can beat on them, so you’ll have to use abilities like confusing them with a cape swing, or flipping over them with a forward flick of the right stick and punching them from behind. It’s easy enough to do this in the most straightforward way possible, but the opportunity to run up the score with unbroken combos and mixing in multiple gadgets like batarangs and explosive charges brings in a very stylish element of challenge beyond simply staying alive. You also have to dodge unblockable attacks with the thumbsticks and physically duck under knife attacks. There’s certainly plenty going on – with more regularly opening up as you unlock new gadgets by progressing the story – to keep these fights and the optional standalone challenges interesting (and repeatable!).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Predator battles work almost identically to the way they do in traditional Arkham games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The stealthy Predator battles, on the other hand, work almost identically to the way they do in traditional Arkham games in that you’re staying hidden as you take down gun-toting enemies who can quickly kill you if they spot you, but they’re a little more frustrating because the controls lack the precision needed to consistently avoid detection. The number of times I snuck up behind an enemy, and reached out to grab and silently choke him out, but accidentally punched him in the head and alerted his friends instead was, to be frank, too high by a lot. I eventually learned to do this extremely carefully – with emergency escape smoke bombs at the ready – to avoid taking a lead shower, but that felt like working around a problem rather than learning a system. Even so, it’s never anything less than gleeful to drop down from a gargoyle perch, grab a thug, and leave him helplessly dangling like a pinata for his friends to find.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also get a handful of boss fights – mostly against the obvious opponents – and although these are a nice change of pace while they last, only one late-game one is all that memorable and none of them are especially interesting on a mechanical level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without the Riddler around to stash question marks everywhere, the Rat cultists have picked up puzzle duty in Blackgate, and their work ranges from trivially easy to respectably tricky and rewarding to solve. Reaching smashable rat statues and radios spreading the King’s propaganda is often a matter of turning left where the obvious path goes right, but frequently involves unlocking doors, crawling through vents, climbing pipes, and more to get the right angle – or deciphering patterns to work out codes to door locks by switching in and out of Detective mode by tapping your temple. Most of Detective mode is pretty straightforward, though – there’s none of the more ambitious crime scene reconstruction stuff from Arkham Knight. Most of it, especially the crime-scene investigation sequences, is basically just doling out plot information one piece at a time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are plenty of Easter eggs to find around Blackgate.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration is, of course, a big part of any Arkham game, and there are plenty of Easter eggs to find around Blackgate. Much of it comes in the form of phone numbers that can be dialed at the prison pay phone to hear recorded messages from various characters. References to Batman lore in chatter from other prisoners and scattered around the environment didn’t appear quite as thick as they are in Rocksteady’s games – which is honestly another off-the-charts standard to hold any game to, especially when the best material has already been thoroughly mined – but it’s not in short supply.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Arkham Ranking</h3><p>From most Arkham-est to least Arkham-est.

No, I never played Arkham Origins: Blackgate but I read the plot summary on Wikipedia.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that’s a little too easy to find at this point, though, are bugs. I’m told there’s a patch in the works to address at least some of this, but even after launch this review was delayed by about a day because I wasn’t able to complete the story thanks to a repeated crash while trying to disarm a bomb, due to the fact I’d done things in an order other than what was precisely intended. That was after multiple crashes before that point, and I also had to reload saves because I fell through the world multiple times and got stuck on level geometry. I had plenty of audio stuttering, saw long load times when returning from the map screen, lost the ability to use my batarang during a boss fight that required it, and had a couple of puzzles made much more difficult than they should’ve been because key items didn’t highlight in Detective mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t as smooth a ride as I’d have liked, but I did see the ending and was pleased with it. I won’t say much about how it turned out other than that, while I did see one big reveal coming a mile away, there was more to it that caught me off guard in a way that made me smile. I don’t think it’s much of a spoiler to say that the Rat King does <em>not</em> turn out to be The Joker, and in fact Camouflaj is admirably restrained in its use of Batman’s nemesis. After the big, eye-rolling reveal of Arkham Origins, and the enormous posthumous role he played in Arkham Knight, leaning on that crutch once again would’ve annoyed me to no end; I breathed a sigh of relief when other characters got some time in the spotlight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the whole it’s a very well done Batman story, and the dialogue is generally strong except for a few <em>very</em> on-the-nose lines where Batman bluntly declares “I <em>will</em> find the Rat King; I <em>will</em> stop his night of wrath!” or when Barbara Gordon acts like an annoying tween fangirl. There's also a <em>very</em> conspicuous loose end left dangling at the end of the story that concerned me until I was told it's intentional, so we'll just have to see where that goes.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Batman: Arkham Shadow does an admirable job of adapting almost everything I love about the Arkham series to work in a full-fledged VR game, and it’s impressive looking for a game that’s exclusive to the standalone Meta Quest 3 headset. There are a few hitches and aggravating bugs that mean some parts don’t work quite as well as others, but its vigorous brawling, exploration, tricky puzzle solving, and stealth are all in full effect as you sneak and punch your way through Blackgate prison in a twisting undercover pursuit of a mysterious cult leader where just about everybody’s a suspect. It’s certainly smaller in scale than any full game since Arkham Asylum, but it’s far larger and more built-out than you might expect after Batman: Arkham VR, and a return to an enclosed prison setting makes it feel dense and intricate. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The rechargeable battery itself is a universal fit, however the Xbox One and Xbox Series X have different style battery doors. Fortunately, both door covers are included in the package (the one labeled #1 is for Xbox One, and the one labeled #2 is for Xbox Series X|S). Note that unlike the Play &amp; Charge Kit which has a USB-C port, this pack uses a Micro USB port. We would have liked to see this pack equipped with a USB-C port as well, but at this price we're not complaining. Besides, a Micro USB cable is included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">6amLifestyle states that each battery pack can last up to 40 hours of continuous playtime and can charge from empty to full in about four hours. That's pretty similar to the Play &amp; Charge Kit's claim of 30 hours of playtime and four-hour charge time, which makes sense since both packs have the same 1,400mAh capacity. There's also a little LED indicator that changes from red to green when it's fully recharged. Having two batteries also means you can immediately swap over to another pack when the first one is depleted, thus minimizing your downtime. At this price, you can't go wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more Xbox deals?

Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 has only been out a couple of months, but already a sequel's on the horizon - albeit not in the way you might immediately assume. Games Workshop has confirmed Warhammer 40K's appearance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Amazon's upcoming Secret Level series</a> will take the form of an animated Space Marine 2 sequel.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if you're unfamiliar, is a new 15-episode animated anthology series from the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s Love, Death &amp; Robots, with each episode featuring "original stories set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games". Those games include Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, a variety of PlayStation Studios games, and, of course,  Warhammer 40K.
</p>
<p>
All that we already knew, but in a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2iuskcvl/secret-level-warhammer-animation-news-out-of-new-york-comic-con/">post</a> on the Warhammer Community website (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40000-secret-level-animation-is-a-sequel-to-space-marine-2">IGN</a>), Games Workshop now shared more on the franchise's upcoming Secret Level episode. For starters, it'll be directed by Tim Miller, with Dave Wilson (responsible for Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War's iconic intro movie) serving as executive producer and supervising director.

<p>
As for specifics, Games Workshop has confirmed - as some sharp-eyed fans had already speculated after the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLihxsmI_OU">Secret Level's teaser trailer</a> - that the episode is indeed a sequel to this year's acclaimed Warhammer 40K shooter Space Marine 2, and follows the conclusion of the game "like a... secret level". Additionally, Clive Standen is onboard, once again voicing Space Marine protagonist Captain Demetrian Titus.
</p><p>
And that's about all we know so far. However, Games Workshop notes a new trailer for the Secret Level series - presumably showing off a bit more of that Space Marine 2 sequel action - is on the way after its recent New York Comic Con reveal, and that fans "won't have to wait too long to see it". As for the series itself, it's set to air on Prime Video from 10th December.
