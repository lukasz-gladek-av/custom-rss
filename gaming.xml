            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another generative AI controversy has arrived in the tabletop community. Except this time it isn't in its use in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a miniature painting competition</a>. It is an official statement by Hasbro's CEO on using generative AI for future <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> products. And the reasoning is tenuous at best.</p>

<p>According to a report by Christian Hoffer for <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-talks-ai-usage-in-d-d-updated.706638/">EN World</a>, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks spoke at a Goldman-Sachs event about how AI products could support <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and other Hasbro brands.</p>
<p>Cocks was asked if the implementation of AI could "bend the cost curve" in terms of entertainment development. Cocks' response was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inside of development, we've already been using AI. It's mostly machine-learning-based AI or proprietary AI as opposed to a ChatGPT approach. We will deploy it significantly and liberally internally as both a knowledge worker aid and as a development aid. I'm probably more excited though about the playful elements of AI. If you look at a typical D&amp;D player....I play with probably 30 or 40 people regularly. There's not a single person who doesn't use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That's a clear signal that we need to be embracing it. We need to do it carefully, we need to do it responsibly, we need to make sure we pay creators for their work, and we need to make sure we're clear when something is AI-generated. But the themes around using AI to enable user-generated content, using AI to streamline new player introduction, using AI for emergent storytelling, I think you're going to see that not just our hardcore brands like D&amp;D but also multiple of our brands."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when taking into account Cocks' intended audience, this statement seems to go against the central appeal and joy of playing TTRPGs. The hobby is, at its core, a deeply creative communal experience. One where the product complements the inherent human experience.</p>

Even if a table uses generative AI at their table, that is in a private personal context. It is a far cry from using it to develop a commercial product that involves paying artists for their work.</p>
<p>This tension between the creative and business implementation of generative AI has been ongoing with Hasbro. Wizards of the Coast had to restate a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ban of AI artwork</a> in their <em>D&amp;D</em> books, There was even hand-wringing over Hasbro posting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-release-statement-regarding-ai-engineering-role" rel="noopener" target="_blank">job listing for AI Engineering</a> on Linkedin.</p>
<p>There is even pushback within Wizards of the Coast's own staff. Greg Tito, Wizards of the Coast's Communications Director, posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gregtito.com/post/3l3ywft6sxf2d">on Bluesky</a>, "I'm deeply mistrustful of AI and don't want people using it anywhere near my D&amp;D campaigns."</p>

Jensen used 75,000 Lego pieces to build the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C_t7uhzyUNd/?img_index=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_t7uhzyUNd/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large and extremely detailed Pelican Town</a></span>. The Lego version of this iconic city includes all the buildings and landmarks you’d expect, from the player character’s farm, to the beach, the rundown community, and all the resident’s houses. Jensen even recreated the <em>Stardew Valley </em>title screen using Lego bricks, too. </p><p>When asked by the outlet which part of the <em>Stardew Valley</em> project was his favorite, Jensen mentioned the Wizard’s Tower, as he feels he perfectly nailed the shape and color of the building. Another favorite is his Lego version of the game’s Hat Shop. </p><p>“I was able to make [it] almost entirely hollow, so you can look through the cracks and broken parts, and see through to more such openings on the other side. Just as a rundown, abandoned structure would be,” Jensen told<em> PC Gamer</em>. </p><p>I’m not a big <em>Stardew Valley </em>guy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-city-toilet-set-poop-piece-6275030-cupcake-top-1849837540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-city-toilet-set-poop-piece-6275030-cupcake-top-1849837540">but as a Lego nerd</a></span>, I’m in love with this build. It’s clear to me that Jensen isn’t just a <em>Stardew Valley </em>fan, but a Lego expert, too. His parts usage is wonderful and the entire build is perfectly scaled with no building or person appearing too small or too big in comparison. </p><p>It’s not surprising that Jensen won the “People’s Choice” award at this year’s BrickCon.

It’s got the fundamentals down—a top-down view, mechanics that blur the line between combat and exploration, and dungeons packed with puzzles—but it also stands apart for a major reason. <em><strong>Chicory </strong></em><strong>is basically a drawing book turned into a game, and for just $10 on </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123450/Chicory_A_Colorful_Tale/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123450/Chicory_A_Colorful_Tale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam</strong></a></span><strong> right now, you can wield the brush that will restore color to its blank world.</strong></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194213" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dungeon &amp; Dragons' Justice Smith Dishes On Movie Cast's Playful Chaos" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="310" data-playlist="194213,196012,197209" data-current="194213"><div><p>Dungeon &amp; Dragons' Justice Smith Dishes On Movie Cast's Playful Chaos</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194213/194213_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194213/194213_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194213/194213_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194213/194213_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19713.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There is no wrong way to color in <em>Chicory</em>. The game never penalizes you for going in a different direction. Leaves should be green, right? Well if you want them to be blue, <em>Chicory </em>won’t tell you otherwise. Grass can be orange, and otherwise earthy rocks can be red. The world is quite literally your canvas, and the game never polices what can and cannot be drawn on, nor does it chastise you if you choose to leave the world blank in many places. Story advancement will require you to engage with the mechanic at some point, but for the most part, you’re allowed to be as creative as you <em>want </em>to be. For folks who doubt their creative abilities (like me), <em>Chicory </em>is a very freeing experience and I found myself constantly grateful for its willingness to meet me on my terms rather than the other way around.<br></p><p>Its story follows Pizza, an anthropomorphic dog that comes to possess a magical brush passed down to Wielders, a select few individuals tasked with the coloring of their respective lands. Chicory is the wielder of the Picnic Province where the game takes place, only she’s stopped coloring and fallen into a depressive bout. She doubts her ability to color and cracks under the pressure of having to bolster the Picnic Province, at which point Pizza, and the player, unceremoniously assume the role in her absence.<br></p><p><em>Chicory</em>’s primary gameplay mechanic is the brush, which is tied to your mouse or one of your thumbsticks. You can hold down the paint button to fill in a certain element of the world or you can flick the brush around and physically paint every bit of it. There are puzzles to be solved, including filling pathways with paint to light up paths through dark caverns, or coloring in a vine so that you can use it to quickly travel between spots. 90 percent of the time, <em>Chicory </em>is the world’s most adorable puzzle game, though the solutions are rarely ever so dense that you perplexedly stare at your screen trying to figure it out.<br></p><p>Otherwise, <em>Chicory </em>is an adventure that is as heartfelt as it is painfully honest. It<em> </em>is obviously a game that presents itself as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535">cute and cozy</a></span>, but it’s also a deeply empathetic look into the creative struggle and the hardship of believing in oneself. You will take on drawing challenges sometimes, and while you’re encouraged to do your absolute best, the game refuses to judge you. <em>Chicory </em>isn’t interested in establishing a hierarchy of art, or trying to define good and bad examples of it. It welcomes your attempts and claps you on the back for even trying. It’s the most accepting game I’ve ever played,a piece of work so utterly driven by the belief that art, and whatever shape it takes, is one of the best things we do.<br></p><p><em>Chicory</em>’s boss fights, which are the only instances of combat in the game and include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PhpHZ76QA&amp;list=PLBO2h-GzDvIZdm61SfbYuYUi-vWPmkr9W&amp;index=20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PhpHZ76QA&amp;list=PLBO2h-GzDvIZdm61SfbYuYUi-vWPmkr9W&amp;index=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this banger of a track</a></span>, build off of some of these notions. During each one of them, you are faced with the manifestations of deep-seated insecurities. They are sometimes gnarly fights against distorted versions of familiar characters and creatures that devolve into bullet hells. Our psyche is often our most damning critic, and unlike most people in the real world, our negative thoughts are rarely sparing. The only way to overcome them is to express yourself through your art. In practice, it’s as simple as simply using the brush to paint over your opponent in most situations, but in real life it could be any number of things. It’s going outside and taking some pictures or picking up a guitar and strumming till you break through that wall impeding your progress.<br></p><p>I’ve rarely played a game in which themes and mechanics were tied together <em>this </em>well. <em>Chicory </em>is an absolutely breathtaking game, and one that feels bound to strike some kind of chord, no matter what walk of life you come to it from. If you want a game that feels like a warm and understanding hug, grab <em>Chicory </em>now and thank me later.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/enotria-the-last-song-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Enotria: The Last Song is quite like most games inspired by From Software-style action RPGs. You patiently adventure through dungeons, put weapons of various shapes and sizes into monsters, and try not to die terribly in the process. It’s all pretty familiar by now, but all the other stuff around that core is where developer Jyamma Games really tries to spice up this recipe. The ideas that work, like taking the setting out of dank caves and swampy bogs into the shimmering light of sunny mountainsides and colorful cities, really work. The things that don’t, like the overwhelming amount of unintuitive things to unlock and equip and the janky performance issues, keep Entoria’s name from gracing the growing list of games that become more than just another soulslike.</p><p>The most striking way Enotria escapes the dark and gloomy shadow of the big games it’s inspired by is its livelier setting and art direction. Where most soulslikes are dedicated to the dank caves and dungeons that are staples of the genre, Enotria gets the sun involved in a big way, beyond simply praising it. Striking skies, rolling fields of golden sunflowers, and clean, sandy shores are front and center. Even places where things go bump in the night still have bold colors and radical environmental aspects like huge, twisting trees. Similarly, many enemy and NPC character designs are covered in little details that make them pop, even when the textures can sometimes feel flat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Enotria: The Last Song - May 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This more vibrant world is suffering from a dark corruption that has trapped everyone in it in a constant state of monotony and repetition. There’s lots of metaphor to stage plays and everyone playing a role like an actor, especially early on, but I found my interest waned in the plot as I progressed. Individual interactions with some characters can be interesting, but in true soulslike fashion, much of this story is hidden in mystery, and I was not all too keen to unravel this one.</p><p>Each area is filled with enemies that vary greatly from each other, but within each region they can get pretty repetitive over time. That doesn’t mean they can’t be dangerous the whole way through, but I saw most of what I could expect from a given region pretty early into it, and it takes about five or so hours to get through one. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A region's enemies can get repetitive, but I did enjoy most bosses.</p></div><p>I did enjoy most of the bosses I encountered, the best of them providing unique challenges that broke up the dungeon skulking. They aren’t all hits, though: Sometimes I fought cool stuff like a big, gnarly hermit crab or a golden conquistador who could moonlight as a Final Fantasy dragoon, while other times I fought the same knight with the same sword combos but different colored armor on four separate occasions.</p><p>It all gets slightly undermined by some inconsistent performance, too. Even my reliable combo of an Intel Core i9-9000 processor and an RTX 3070 GPU struggled to keep the frame rate smooth, usually when entering new zones or fighting outside in very sunny spots. It was always a bummer to see such pretty spaces chug so dramatically, regardless of the combination of settings I tried.</p><p>Even so, there’s a lot of worthwhile exploration to do in each of Enotria’s three zones. Areas like the eerie yet bustling city of Quintia are dense with lots of branching paths that lead to loot or shortcuts. Occasionally, these shortcuts can help you bypass whole sections of a castle or crypt, but very few turn out to be paths to whole new locations. There were plenty of nooks and crannies to despite the relative linearity of each zone , but there were some gimmicks that seemed like they would be a bigger deal early on that showed up very scarcely after, like white glyphs that can be activated to make temporary platforms and structures to open up new locations.</p><p>Much more common are the red glyphs all over the world that unleash combat challenges which range from pushovers to absolute menaces – I was happy to see they were optional after I went knocking on their door and got knocked on my ass. It was sort of strange and jarring, then, when I would stumble into rooms that also included bosses that I would later learn were not necessary to beat just lingering around without that same kind of action to opt in, so to speak. It’s like Enotria identified surprise bosses as a problem with soulslikes and made red glyphs to address that, and then in the same game shunned their own solution. It’s not a huge issue – this kind of pushback is par for the course in these games – but it’s a head-scratching moment of inconsistency.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Finding new enemies to beat up is always a good experience.</p></div><p>I’m willing to forgive things like that because combat is pretty strong, so finding new enemies to beat up is always a good experience (framerate issues notwithstanding). Anyone familiar with these sorts of games will be at home with the basic light and heavy attacks being governed by stamina. There is no blocking, and parrying doesn’t stun enemies outright, instead building up a gauge that eventually opens bad guys up for big attacks. Entoria’s parry window is more forgiving than in games like Lies of P, which similarly wraps its defensive strategy around counters, and therefore it felt way more approachable in the early game. Around midway in to this 30ish hour campaign, expect to get that deflect button tested regularly by enemies with longer attack strings, or encounters with multiple baddies at once. I liked the gradual easing into this kind of challenge, but sometimes I felt like the claustrophobic camera and the lock-on with a mind of its own felt like they were working for the enemies. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The risk/reward of the parry system extends to the four status ailments you can afflict on enemies (or be afflicted by), each having a dual set of conditions that help and harm. Causing dizziness on opponents reduces their defenses, but also makes them stronger and lets them recover stamina more quickly. Sick is your standard poison that does damage over time, but if you get too close to a sick enemy you can get sick yourself. It does sometimes feel counterintuitive or regressive on some bosses especially; using the fatuo element against enemies weak to it will do more damage – but it will also put the wicked status on them, which makes all of their elemental power way more destructive. Overall, though, I think the ailment system does encourage staying vigilant even when you have the advantage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The four status ailments each have dual conditions that help and harm.</p></div><p>On the other hand, Entoria’s seven weapon types aren’t all as distinct from one another, mechanically. Ultra greatswords and colossal hammers are <em>technically</em> different on paper, but in practice I found no need to dedicate my two weapon slots to both of these where one big stick would do. There are around 120 weapons across all of these types, and while I didn’t find nearly as many as that, the ones I did find covered just about every base possible when it came to the four types of elemental damage they could do, those corresponding status ailments, and how they scale with your stats. Interestingly, different weapons can hide some additional abilities that are only be activated when using the right light/heavy combos. I didn’t spend too much time testing which ones do what, but more than once the decision to choose between two similar weapons with similar traits came down to the fact that one of them did extra elemental damage when I hit the right button and the other didn't, and I enjoyed having that opportunity.</p><p>As far as building your character goes, masks are as close to classes as Enotria gets. Besides changing your look, they offer passive bonuses like doing more damage with heavy attacks or increasing stamina and defense. To get an effective build going, you need to use their boons as a baseline and layer on additional modifications in the form of roles and perks. The former are aspects of enemies you defeat that alter your stats in positive and negative ways, while also giving you more passive bonuses; I beat up a big crab and its aspect raised three of my stats but lowered two others while also raising my health by a percentage. On top of that, perks can add even more passive quirks to all of the attacks, dodges, parries, and abilities you'll use. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Jarrett Green's Soulslike Samba</h3><p>A definitive, completely correct list of the best Soulslikes around</p></div><p>Mixing and matching mask lines – Enotria’s version of offensive and defensive skills and spells – can be fun. Most of them are pretty impactful, even if the only real difference between many of them is the special elemental or status effects they cause. They must be charged up by hitting enemies before they can be employed, meaning they can’t be used to get you out of binds reactionarily. This isn’t so bad when adventuring through dungeons because you’ll have plenty of opportunities to hit things and fill up your meters. The problem appears when you pull up to a boss fight, which empties your meters fully before you start, meaning you have to work up to these powerful attacks from scratch against the tough challenges where you’d likely need them the most. I can understand why the designers would want to level the playing field, but it always felt needlessly punitive and I’d have liked to have been able to take advantage of preparing for a fight in that way. Mask line gauges also drain every time you rest at a bonfire, which felt more annoying than bad.</p><p>This is a lot of character tweaking to do, and perhaps too much for all but the most dedicated build hounds. I enjoy that myself, but what’s irritating is that none of the impacts of this lasagna of layered RPG systems are well communicated before testing things live against enemies. A list of all the bonuses being applied by everything in my loadout would have done wonders for measuring my build’s potential while still in the menu screen, for example. Charging speeds for lines are in Italian, which isn't an issue for me and Google translate’s powers combined, but when “presto” and “vivace” both mean fast, theres no telling which one is faster without just figuring it out on the fly. Being able to set up three separate loadouts, each with their own masks, weapons, lines, perks, etc, that you can switch through on the fly means you can be ready for anything, but after settling on two builds I liked, I almost never made use of the third. In fact, I didn’t have to interact much with any of these systems after finding a good build early, which both highlights how ineffective it is at creating diverse play styles naturally, and how strong the combat is without all of that noise.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Aside from the fundamentals of combat, Enotria: The Last Song really tries to step outside of the box when it comes to dressing up the standard soulslike. The sun-drenched environments and wild, Italian folklore-inspired character designs are a real breath of fresh air straight from Italy’s Alps. Combat is fun, even when the difficulty spikes unexpectedly (since most of those fights are optional anyway) and despite the bloat of many, many systems that govern all of the more nuanced abilities and stats. The unapproachability of its RPG systems, and the wonky performance when a smooth frame rate matters the most are what really prevent Enotria from taking center stage.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-interview-with-jun-furutani-discussing-the-series-return-game-modes-netcode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-launches-on-october-11th-new-trailer-released/">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> is the long-anticipated return of the Budokai Tenkaichi series, which, from the very first entry in the series, set itself apart from most games based on the series created by Akira Toriyama with its explosive gameplay that well represented the intense fights filled with energy blasts and all sorts of other explosive combat techniques.</p><p>During Gamescom 2024, we had the chance not only to try out the game but also to speak with the game's producer Jun Furutani, discussing the return of the series, the available game modes, the netcode, and the possibility of high framerate options. Enjoy!</p><p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p><div>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is releasing a long time after the previous entry in the series. Why did it take so long, considering how Dragon Ball's popularity continues to be immense?</strong></p>
<p>When we released Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, I thought the game was almost complete. At the same time, I had a lot of plans for other games. However, with the advancement of new technology, new game engines, and current-generation consoles, we had become able to deliver new surprises over the previous entry in the series, so it felt the right time had come to bring back the series, and we went ahead and developed Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier today, I tried out the game, and it felt familiar and very accessible right from the start. However, I noticed the game had some additional accessibility options. Why were these added, considering the series has always been quite accessible?</strong></p>
<p>The previous entries in the series featured very fast gameplay, which made it difficult for a lot of beginners to play them. When I played the series for the first time, I had some trouble controlling my character, and I lost to my friends. <em>(laughs)</em> Nowadays, with games like Dragon Ball FighterZ and other competitive games, it is possible to perform combos with just a single button, which makes it a game that's easy to play at the most basic level, something that's great for beginners.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something similar with Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO and make the action feel good for every sort of player, providing options that would make the game enjoyable, no matter the skill level. Advanced players can perform the most complicated inputs manually, have more options, and can reach a higher level, so there's still the motivation to turn off these assistance options, as they are meant to help players who have never played a game in the series before.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is powered by Unreal Engine 5. Why did you go with it? Has it allowed you to do things not possible otherwise?</strong></p>
<p>The game focuses on letting the player feel like a Dragon Ball character, so immersion is extremely important, and Unreal Engine 5 allowed us to improve it with more real-time graphics, such as visual effects when a character powers up, when the sky darkens, and so on. Additionally, during the game's high-speed, high-power battles, characters can be launched towards buildings or mountains, whose destruction is in real-time. All this has been possible by using Unreal Engine 5, making battles even more exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO has a lot of characters. How did you pick characters? Is there any character that was originally considered but was later dropped?</strong></p>
<p>Being the new entry in a long-running series, it was natural to start off with characters featured in the previous games. Budokai Tenkaichi 3 had 161 characters, and we are aiming to go even higher in Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO. Like the previous games, there are character variants from different eras, which is something fans loved to see in the older games, so by doing the same in the new game, players will be able to feel familiar with the experience right from the start. As the Dragon Ball story has evolved since the release of the previous game, we have added characters from Dragon Ball Super on top of the existing roster.</p>
<p>As for characters that did not make it into Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO, I cannot talk about it, as we have a strict policy on the matter and do not want to spoil anything. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>How did you approach balancing with such a huge roster? Have canonically weaker characters been balanced so that they can hold their own against stronger ones?</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is not a competitive game like Dragon Ball FighterZ, where there must be some balance between characters. The game is all about providing a Dragon Ball experience, so characters who are strong in the anime and manga are just as strong in the game. For example, a character like Gogeta is going to be very strong, while others like Mr. Satan will struggle a lot. It's all part of Dragon Ball and, thus, the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, we do have a system that balances the power of every character. In tournaments, for example, each character has a cost, so players will not be able to pick the five strongest characters for their team, forcing them to balance things out and still providing a reason for a player to pick a weaker character.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO features a single-player mode called Episode Battles. How many of them are there? Is there any secret scenario to unlock?</strong></p>
<p>Episode Battles cover the Dragon Ball story from the battle with the Saiyans until the Dragon Ball Super Power Tournament. However, there will be a different number of battles, depending on the character. Of the playable characters, which include Goku, Gohan, Piccolo and Vegeta, Goku will have the most battles, starting from his battle against Raditz until the Power Tournament. Additional Episodes can also be unlocked while playing.</p>
<p><strong>Any other single-player mode?</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO also features a custom battle mode that lets players create their own scenarios, pick among a selection of pre-set battles, and share their custom battles online. There's also a local Tournament Mode where eight players compete for the top spot using different rules. While this is primarily a local and online multiplayer mode, it can also be played in single-player mode against opponents controlled by the AI.</p>
<p><strong>Besides Tournament Mode, which modes will be available for online play?</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's online modes include a ranking mode, a player match mode where players can freely create a room and invite their friends to play, and the aforementioned Tournament mode.</p>
<p><strong>Which type of netcode will the game feature?</strong></p>
<p>Delay-based netcode.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about multiplayer, Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO will launch with a local multiplayer mode that will support only a single map. Are there any plans to expand the map selection over time?</strong></p>
<p>I can't comment on this yet. Please wait for more information in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Modern fighting games support high refresh rate monitors to reduce input delay. Will Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO follow suit?</strong></p>
<p>There are no plans to offer a high refresh rate mode on any platform. The game will run at 60 frames per second across PC and consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-cdl-superteam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-100-thieves-to-build-cdl-%E2%80%98superteam%E2%80%99-based-on-scrap-and-hydra.980700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-cdl-superteam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed that 100 Thieves, which is represented in the Call of Duty League by the LA Thieves, is looking to assemble a so-called ‘superteam’ for the new season. In a report online published by Breaking Point, it was claimed that HyDra, Envoy, Scrap, and Ghosty are exploring this option ahead of the CDL 2025 season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mightiest">The Mightiest</h2>



<p>Per the report published on social media by Breaking Point, Toronto Ultra’s Scrap and Cloud9’s HyDra are eager to team up in the new season. It was also claimed that the remaining two slots would be occupied by Envoy (Ultra) and Ghosty, who already owns a spot on the LA Thieves roster.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that this would represent one of the nastiest power squads in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>HyDra is often considered one of the best Call of Duty players of all time in terms of raw skill and gunny. He’s known as the French Phenon for a reason, and in the 2023 season, he was instrumental in the New York Subliners winning two Majors and COD Champs.</p>



<p>In 2023, Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst won Rookie of the Year, going on to become a force to be reckoned with and earning some of the highest and most consistent ratings out of any pro COD player <strong>ever</strong>. He’s a bit inflammatory, but the fans love it.</p>



<p>Envoy, who has been dubbed ‘The Prince’, and Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe are both stellar competitors with plenty to offer any team in the CDL. Envoy and Scrap have teamed for an entire year, which gives them valuable chemistry, and Ghosty has been serving as a fine IGL for a long time.</p>



<p>There are a few blockers, though. Per <a href="https://x.com/GGBreakingPoint/status/1834667387872030828" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breaking Point</a>, the budget to arrange this move would be ‘challenging’ at best, and it would of course require several buy-outs, some of which (HyDra and Scrap) might be exorbitant.</p>



<p>This is the reality of rostermania – you never know what’s going to happen next.</p>



<p>Do you think this team could win COD Champs? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

Blizzard has shared more on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s previously announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> collaboration - which arrives as part of the MMO's 20th anniversary celebrations - confirming the event begins next Tuesday, 17th September.
</p>
<p>
Word of its start date arrives alongside a nifty new trailer featuring a first-person ride through a theme-park-style attraction called Blizzard World. As the trailer unfolds, a number of unseen Overwatch 2 characters comment on the ensuing crossover mayhem, and we're given a glimpse at the hero shooter's new World of Warcraft collaboration skins.
</p>
<p>
Those skins include Sylvanas Windrunner Widowmaker, Lich King Reinhardt, Thrall Zenyatta, and Diamond Magni Torbjorn. Whether Blizzard has anything more planned for Overwatch 2's big World of Warcraft event beyond a handful of skins remains to be seen, but all will likely be revealed when the event gets underway next week.

<p>
Overwatch 2's World of Warcraft collaboration arrives as part of its 12th season, which introduced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-new-hero-is-space-ranger-juno-and-shes-available-to-play-today">new support hero Juno</a>, Clash mode, new maps, and more back in August. It also comes as Blizzard plots <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">potentially major changes</a> for Overwatch 2, with director Aaron Keller having recently confirmed the team is considering - if not guaranteeing - the return of 6v6 matches, after player counts were downsized to 5v5 when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> transitioned to its sequel.
</p>
<p>
It was also recently reported that Activision and Microsoft have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-has-reportedly-set-up-a-smaller-team-to-create-aa-games-based-on-its-franchises">established a new "smaller" team</a> within Blizzard to develop "AA" games based on its existing properties.

		<p><em>It feels like Star Wars is better known for its controversies than the stories it's telling. That's less true when it comes to Star Wars games, at least, but while we seem to have more Star Wars-centric games than we've seen in years, doesn't it sometimes feel a little same-y?</em></p><p><em>Part of the reason Star Wars Outlaws feels like such a breath of fresh air is because it feels a bit like a trick? Ubisoft funded a AAA Star Wars video game that cost tens of millions of dollars and you don't throw a lightsaber around? You're a thief who sneaks around a bunch?</em></p><p><em>Sure, Outlaws is not without its issues, but it harkens back to a different era of Star Wars video games, when a universe that is both specific and intriuiginly undefined could support all kinds of different video games.</em></p><p><em> Could we capture that again? </em></p><p><em>That's what Rob and Patrick are here to figure out. </em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@lhgerona?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Lyman Hansel Gerona</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>So Rob, I’ve been thinking about how you’ve fallen a bit for Star Wars <em>Outlaws</em>. We have some scattered data <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/despite-high-hopes-for-star-wars-outlaws-and-xdefiant-ubisofts-share-price-is-now-sitting-at-a-10-year-low/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>suggesting the game has not been a massive hit</u></a>, but we aren’t privy to Ubisoft and Disney’s expectations, so who knows? What we do know is that <em>Star Wars Outlaw</em>s is a good game, but your mileage may vary based on how you take to the stealth, and how much simply being in a gorgeously realized <em>Star Wars </em>world is enough to make you happy.</p><p>What it got me wondering about, more broadly, is the state of Star Wars video games. If this <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-star-wars-games/?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>Games Radar</u></em></a><em><u> </u></em>article is correct, here’s what has been announced for the future of Star Wars:</p><ul><li>Untitled Respawn Strategy Game</li><li><em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> (Quantic Dream)</li><li><em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> Remake</li><li>Untitled Amy Hennig Star Wars Game</li><li>Star Wars Jedi 3&nbsp;</li></ul><p>It’s a predictable spread, with a big emphasis on splashy, action-centric games where, inevitably, the player is likely to be at the center of events that Could Destroy Everyone. It’s missing some of that weird spice that helped define Star Wars gaming’s best runs in the past.</p><p>I wouldn’t describe myself as a Star Wars kid growing up, but when you look over the list of Star Wars video games released in the past, you suddenly realize “well, I sure as hell was a Star Wars <em>video game</em> kid.” <em>Super Star Wars. Star Wars Episode I: Racer. Rebel Assault. X-Wing and Tie Fighter. Rogue Squadron. Shadow of the Empire. Knights of the Old Republic. </em>Hell, I think I even loaded up that weird<em> Yoda Stories </em>because it came bundled with something else.</p><p>What makes <em>Outlaws </em>interesting, and perhaps risky (?), is how it ditches force powers and lightsabers. I mean, that stuff <em>exists</em> in the world of <em>Outlaws</em>, but you are not a secret demi-god.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it only feels risky because of how modern Star Wars revolves around Luke Skywalker, which then inherently limits the kinds of stories you can tell and the gameplay supporting that?</p><p>And while it’s true many, many <em>Star Wars</em> video games in its long history have involved players getting to cosplay as Luke Skywalker or someone with the same power set, many of my favorite Star Wars games are where you’re more of a grunt! You get to inhabit a space in this weird, vaguely familiar world. What’s cool about, say, X-Wing is being adjacent to all the space magic.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easier to role-play because if our own world suddenly had such fantastical things, it’s far more likely that you or I would be witnessing it from the sidelines, not getting to wield it around.</p><p>You’ve played much more <em>Outlaws</em> than me. You’ve also thought about <em>Star Wars </em>storytelling way more than me. Where do you think <em>Outlaws </em>fits within <em>Star Wars’ </em>gaming history?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@sushioutlaw?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Brian McGowan</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I think you’ve already touched on it: <em>Outlaws </em>fits within this tradition of <em>Star Wars </em>games existing on the margins or in the backdrop of that universe… but it’s a major AAA release of the kind that didn’t even exist when LucasArts / Lucasfilm Games were at their peak. That might highlight why success with the license has proven to be so elusive. The universe has always lent itself to games that let you inhabit the setting… but not necessarily take part in the main action of the plot. You get access to the setting’s toybox, and that’s always been the part of the universe that lends itself most readily to video games.</p><p>So you had a really perfect overlap in the 90s between the stuff the video games excelled at, the stuff people wanted from a <em>Star Wars </em>game, and the costs of developing games in those genres relative to their prospective audience. Four of those games you mentioned are basically, “You wanna sit in the cockpit of a <em>Star Wars </em>ship or race car and blast away?” I might even argue <em>Shadows of the Empire </em>counts for those purposes because the flight stages loom so large in the memory for that game.</p><p>I think it helped that in those days Lucasfilm’s games operation was really creatively-led. I mean this is a company that decided (correctly!) that Indiana Jones was a point-and-click adventure hero, not an action hero. Part of that’s because other genres couldn’t support the kinds of interactions that define Indy, and the adventure genre was a bigger deal back then, but I also think it highlights the way Lucasfilm made decisions that were right for its stories rather than just optimizing for broad appeal. Flight games, racing games, shooters, adventures, D&amp;D-based RPGs… they were all viable genres for a major publisher and <em>Star Wars </em>lends itself to all of them. Except you wouldn’t be Luke or Han, you’d be “pilot who might have flown with Luke” or “race car driver who might have been a rival of Sebulba’s.”</p><p><em>Outlaws </em>has a lot of the spirit of those games, I think. It’s nerdy about the background details of the setting in a way that exactly understands how and why various segments of the fandom could thrive on technical manuals for made up hardware, video games that took place almost entirely away from the main plot of the films, and really uneven books and comics. You’re not Han Solo or Lando Calrissian… but you’re the kind of dirtbag they certainly <em>seem </em>like they might have been at some point (which is probably why so much of <em>Outlaws </em>takes its cues from <em>Solo</em>). You want to be Luke Skywalker and face down the Emperor? Then go play something else, because what we’re going to let you do is ante up at the sabacc tables.</p><p>But… it’s an open world action stealth adventure of the kind that seemed entirely impractical in the 90s, something that hardware could never possibly support. I happen to think it does a great job of building the game’s texture from the setting, but the very nature of that kind of game tends to muddle the pitch. Games like this are kind of like quilts made from different scraps of genres, which gives them a measure of variety but also tends to mean there is no one thing that really distinguishes them except how much you like the characters and the setting. Is <em>Outlaws </em>a stealth game? Yeah, in the way that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>is a stealth series, but not in the way <em>Dishonored </em>or <em>Hitman </em>is a stealth series. Is it a space shooter? Well, it has some pretty well-done space shooting in it but, no, not in the way that <em>TIE Fighter </em>is or <em>Everspace 2 </em>are. How about a regular shooter? Well it’s perfectly fine when it “goes loud” but, no, it’s pretty pointedly not trying to evoke <em>Gears </em>or <em>Wolfenstein</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-game-pass-subscriptions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to a new report, Microsoft is banking that Call of Duty will help to increase its game pass subscription numbers.</p>



<p>That’s according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ffwv5v/microsoft_is_banking_on_call_of_duty_on_game_pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a>, who has reported that sources have said that Microsoft is hoping that Call of Duty coming to Xbox Game Pass will help to grow its gaming revenue numbers. According to Warren, the company had a long debate as to whether or not they should put this year’s Call of Duty title, which will be Black Ops 6, into the subscription server. He continues to report that the “company is now gambling that it will help improve Game Pass subscriber numbers amid a busy holiday season for new Xbox games and a promising year ahead.”</p>



<p>Xbox announced that Black Ops 6 will be coming on day one for Game Pass subscribers in May 2024, making it the first Call of Duty title ever to go to a subscription service on the same day as its launch. Two months later, the company announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increases to its Game Pass subscription by as much as 25%</a>. As of February 2024, the company reported that Xbox Game Pass had a total of 34 million paying customers across its three pricing tiers.</p>



<p>It’s evident that Microsoft wants Call of Duty to increase its Game Pass subscriptions and revenues; after all, it is a business, but the question is, by how much and for how long? Call of Duty is a mammoth franchise, but hoping that one game can substantially increase subscription numbers seems a bit of a reach. </p>



<p>The news comes following another round of layoffs at Microsoft, in which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approximately 650 employees were laid off</a> from its gaming division. According to an internal memo by Phil Spencer, these were mostly corporate and support functions, with reports online suggesting that mostly Activision Blizzard employees were affected. </p>



<p>Microsoft fully acquired Activision Blizzard in October 2023 for a total cost of <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/32336/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$75.4 billion</a>.</p>

But once the price tag was revealed, sticker shock took over and largely drowned out more nuanced conversations about the new device.</p><h2 id="h864"><a id=""></a>How much better will games look on PS5 Pro?</h2><p>It’s easy to understand why. $700 is a lot to spend on a video game console, and adjusted for inflation is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-to-sell-a-more-powerful-700&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-to-sell-a-more-powerful-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-highest price</a></span> Sony has charged for a new console. And the company’s presentation did it no favors in trying to sell players on the virtues of making a PS5 Pro their next big gaming purchase. Cerny’s presentation showed old games, including the next-gen port of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> which originally came out on the PS4. There was no new game running in 4K at 60fps to wow fans, and the differences with smoothness and background detail were hard to detect over the internet. Weirdly, only one outlet, <em>CNET</em>, seemed to have been invited to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test the new hardware in-person</a></span>.</p><p>It wasn’t until some experts started looking at direct, lossless renders of the PS5 Pro gameplay footage that the improvements left a larger impression. “Wow, yeah, FF7R looks a LOT better on PS5 Pro,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dark1x/status/1834165882039271867&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1834165882039271867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s John Linneman a couple of days after the initial reveal. “Night and day difference. I actually put off playing it due to other things happening at the time of release but the Pro will finally push me to enjoy it. Image quality was just too awful on normal PS5.”</p><p>The lowkey comment ignited a firestorm of replies and quote-tweets slamming the PS5 Pro and the critique of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s existing graphics on the base PS5. Which was weird, because the way that Square Enix’s sprawling RPG looked gorgeous when static but choppy in motion was widely covered at launch. If anything, it’s an ideal test case for the PS5 Pro upgrade: a third party game struggling to hold things together within the current limitations of the launch hardware.</p><h2 id="h865"><a id=""></a>A comparable PC is more expensive than people think</h2><p>  <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> is also the type of game that will be coming to PC in the future, where on higher-end machines it will likely look even better than on PS5 Pro. But how much will those gaming rigs cost relative to what Sony’s offering? We don’t have the full official specs for the PS5 Pro yet, but builds on sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pcpartpicker.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCPartPicker</a></span> run the gamut from a little more expensive to a <em>lot </em>more expensive. </p><p>For example, a barebones PC build by <em>IGN</em> trying to match the SSD storage and GPU power arrived at an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-build-a-pc-equivalent-to-the-ps5-pro-heres-how&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-build-a-pc-equivalent-to-the-ps5-pro-heres-how" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated cost of around $930</a></span>. Not bad for a machine that has access to Steam sales, Epic Games Store freebies, and doesn’t require you to pay a monthly subscription for online multiplayer. But other more conservative estimates put the price much higher. A custom build by<em> Techradar</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-build-a-ps5-pro-pc-equivalent-gaming-rig&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-build-a-ps5-pro-pc-equivalent-gaming-rig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated the cost at closer to $1,200</a></span>, and that’s not even including a DualSense controller to get the most out of first-party Sony games once they’re ported to PC. Even that number might be low-baling it, though. </p><p>“Probably a fair bit more,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s Richard Leadbetter told <em>IGN</em> in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/videos/digital-foundry-on-the-ps5-pro-gta-6-others-unlikely-to-hit-60fps&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/digital-foundry-on-the-ps5-pro-gta-6-others-unlikely-to-hit-60fps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent interview</a></span> when asked how much a comparable PC would cost. “If you consider the holistic view of all the different components, the enhanced ray tracing—no AMD GPU has that at the moment—the machine learning block—no AMD GPU has that—it’s almost like essentially an Nvidia-style feature set but made by AMD and the closest equivalent GPU you’ll be locking at would be the RTX 4070. The 4060 is quite close to base PlayStation 5, factoring out machine learning and ray tracing, so you’re looking at a 4070.” </p><p>The cheapest versions of those GPUs often run over $500, with costs “ramping up” from there after including the 2TB SSD, motherboard, case, and other required PC parts.  Leadbetter stressed that the PS5 Pro price is still “crazy,” but that the math is a little more complicated, in addition to the product being largely pitched at existing PlayStation users who are unlikely to want to jump to PC and leave their existing game libraries behind. He also noted that the hardware jump from the PS5 to the PS5 Pro is smaller this time around than when Sony showcased the move from PS4 to PS4 Pro, which he largely blamed on an industry-wide struggle to bring down the costs of higher-performing tech. </p><h2 id="h866"><a id=""></a>What’s the PS5 Pro hate really about?</h2><p>Not everyone believes that Sony is putting its best foot forward with the PS5 Pro price. An<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FglPnj1eu2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FglPnj1eu2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> opinion video</a></span> on the reveal by LinusTechTips blamed it in part on a lack of competition in the high-end console space. With PS5 reportedly outselling the Xbox Series X/S two-to-one, and a Switch 2 still not ready for primetime, the YouTube channel argues that there’s less pressure on Sony to cut its profit margins on the PS5 Pro and try to bring it in at a more appealing price point. </p><p>There’s some analysis to back up this argument. “With no comparable mid-gen upgrade from Microsoft, and Nintendo’s upcoming console expected to be less powerful than the base PS5, Sony is positioning the PS5 Pro as a premium offering for console gamers seeking superior graphics performance at a somewhat accessible price compared to high-end PCs,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3l3zxyxuinu2p&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3l3zxyxuinu2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, in a recent thread on the topic. </p><p>With the console aimed squarely at existing PS5 owners locked into a living room gaming setup, the Pro offers Sony the chance to sell the most powerful console on the market at an audience of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1833531529747960244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1833531529747960244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price insensitive</a></span>” users willing to spend extra. “Manufacturing costs, including component prices such as for SSDs, continued to remain high post pandemic and have squeezed hardware margins,” Ahmad wrote. “The lack of overall console install base expansion from prior gens has also led to platform holders maximizing spend per user and expanding beyond console.”</p><p>Even if the Pro makes business sense for Sony, it doesn’t do anything to assuage the growing frustration with the PlayStation platform this console generation. While the PS4 era was typified by lower-cost debut hardware and the coming-online of a first-party studio system aimed at churning out one mega blockbuster after another, the PS5 era is synonymous with higher prices and a feeling of less innovation and experimentation.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><em>Astro Bot</em> is a shiny exception</a></span> in a sea of first-party sequels that felt impressive but bloated compared to the novelty of their PS4-era predecessors. </p><p>Where are the brand-new Sony franchises? Where are the PS5 blockbusters pushing the envelope not just on graphics but in terms of storytelling, mechanics, and design? Instead of a big 2024 PlayStation showcase blowing them away, fans got <em>Concord</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309?_gl=1*i21kms*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjIzNDQzMi4xMzAuMS4xNzI2MjUzNTI0LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309?_gl=1*i21kms*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjIzNDQzMi4xMzAuMS4xNzI2MjUzNTI0LjU4LjAuMA..">a live-service also-ran so out of sync</a></span> with the player base that Sony unceremoniously unreleased it inside of a month. In some ways Sony is a victim of its own success, and the lofty expectations that now accompany it. And so far the only thing that feels extraordinary about the PS5 Pro is its price. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Metro developer 4A Games is not leaving the Embracer Group for Saber Interactive after all. When Saber <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its split with Embracer six months ago, it also secured the rights to acquire the Ukrainian studio. However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed today that the move won't actually happen.</p>
<p><em>Saber CEO Matt Karch told me in a statement this morning that "it was always our intention to exercise on 4A” but “we thought it would be better for all parties” for the studio to instead remain with Embracer.</em></p>
<p>The news didn't exactly sit well with fans, especially after Embracer closed down several studios and laid off many employees throughout the whole group. Perhaps they'll feel better when 4A Games finally unveils its next project. The publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-metro-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a new Metro installment as early as August 2019, but we still haven't learned anything concrete other than a generic '202X' release window.</p>
<p>This year, series fans are <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> a Virtual Reality game called Metro Awakening, but it's being developed by Vertigo Games (the maker of Arizona Sunshine) instead. According to the little info we have, it will be a prequel with a supernatural vibe:</p>
<p><em>The year is 2028. The survivors of nuclear Armageddon cling to existence in the buried subways of the Moscow Metro – civilization’s last refuge and tomb, where ghosts and spirits haunt the living in this man-made purgatory.</em></p>
<p><em>You are Serdar, a doctor braving the darkness, crippling radiation and deadly threats of the Metro in the search for your wife and the medication she so desperately needs. As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit, you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become…</em></p>
<p>The unveiling of the next mainline Metro title (which the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sdk-released-next-metro-influenced-by-russian-invasion-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said </a>will be influenced by their experience with the Russian war) could happen as soon as the upcoming The Game Awards event. It would be about time, certainly.</p>

                <p>There's nothing quite like Doom, especially after recent releases saw the series reinvent itself as a fast-paced arcade-shooter that wasn't afraid to paint the town red with demonic blood. A new entry in the series was recently revealed, and this time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> will see players create a medieval massacre when they take on the armies of the damned.</p><p>A dark fantasy with an over-the-top arsenal and a metal soundtrack, rumors of a Doom prequel began to appear in 2023 after court documents were leaked, with the game having the working title of Doom: Year Zero. Now that it's out in the wild, here's a closer look at everything we know about Doom: The Dark Ages so far.</p><h2>When will Doom: The Dark Ages be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366691-doomdarkages_0000_doomthedarkages_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366691" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366691-doomdarkages_0000_doomthedarkages_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366691"></a><figcaption>All hell is about to break loose on Argent D'Nur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366691-doomdarkages_0000_doomthedarkages_01.jpg"></figure><p>As revealed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">2024 Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages will be released in 2025.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages platforms</h2><p>Doom: The Dark Ages will have a multi-platform release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. Microsoft owns the franchise but will continue to release new entries in the series on rival systems like PS5. It's a first-party game for Microsoft, so it should also be available via Game Pass.</p><h2>Will Doom: The Dark Ages be PS5 Pro enhanced?</h2><p>The number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" data-ref-id="2900-5758">games with a PS5 Pro Enhanced label</a> are still small for now, and Doom: The Dark Ages isn't currently on that list. Games developed by Id Software are typically some of the best-in-class when it comes to visuals, and the next Doom could certainly benefit from the extra horsepower of that system if it does get optimized for the high-end Sony console.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages story, setting, and characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366690-doomdarkages_0001_doomthedarkages_announce_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366690" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366690-doomdarkages_0001_doomthedarkages_announce_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366690"></a><figcaption>The Doom Slayer is back, and rocking some furry fashion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366690-doomdarkages_0001_doomthedarkages_announce_05.jpg"></figure><p>Doom: The Dark Ages bridges the gap between the original games from the '90s and the ones released in the 2010s, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom/" data-ref-id="5000-285543">Doom (2016)</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>. According to the lore entries of the previous games, Doom Guy wound up on the world of Argent D'Nur, home of Night Sentinels, and he was forced to fight in the gladiator pits after he was enslaved. After proving his worth in combat, the Doom Slayer joined the Night Sentinels, just in time for Hell's invasion of Argent D'Nur.</p><p>This is where The Dark Ages has the potential to tell one of the more exciting chapters in the Doom saga, as according to the lore, Doom Guy was empowered by Maykr technology in a last-ditch effort to stop the armies of Hell. After the Night Sentinels discovered that they had ultimately been betrayed by the Maykrs, who sided with Hell so that they could use the conflict to generate Argent Energy, the warriors and Doom Guy embarked on a suicide mission into Hell to throw a spanner in the plans of the Maykrs.</p><p>What we do know is that only Doom Guy survived, spending an eternity in Hell and becoming the Doom Slayer of legend.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3KftOn8YdE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g3KftOn8YdE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like the other Doom games, the primary combat of The Dark Ages is pure run-and-gun action at its core. The game has a distinct push-forward sense of energy influenced by the original Doom games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-was-inspired-by-the-original-doom/1100-6524144/" data-ref-id="1100-6524144">according to The Dark Ages' directors Hugo Martin and Marty Stratton</a>.</p><p>"At the beginning of project, everybody kind of goes back and plays the original Doom," said Stratton. "There were so many things in that original game that just have have fueled us... It's always that evolution, but there's just so much of the DNA even with the way that we develop and our our team size. When we were talking about like what is Doom [in development], it was very much like borrowing from those ideas of the original Doom and Doom 2. As the brand has evolved and the ideas through the lore and all the different gameplay mechanics have evolved... it's amazing when you play the game you're just like 'this is unbelievable.'"</p><p>The directors also explained how the slower-moving projectiles in this game harken back to the first two Doom titles.</p><p>"I think in the original Doom, in the opening hours, we all remember imps or soldiers firing slow moving projectiles... and they hit hard," explained Martin. "And if you get hit by one of those, you're in a lot of trouble... That's where the movement comes in. Instead of constructing a multi-tiered arena... if we ground it, slow down the projectiles, make them hit way harder, and create patterns in the space, then that's the jungle gym you're going to move through."</p><p>What we haven't seen yet is how the health and ammo economy of The Dark Ages will function. 2016's Doom forced players to essentially use specific tools and moves to harvest what they needed from their enemies, and Doom Eternal built on that idea with a system of action, chainsaws, flamethrowers, and swords. It was a killer combo of rhythm and speed, and it'll be interesting to see how Doom's emphasis on rip and tearing through enemies will evolve in The Dark Ages.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages weapons</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366689-doomdarkages_0002_doomthedarkages_announce_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366689" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366689-doomdarkages_0002_doomthedarkages_announce_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366689"></a><figcaption>The Doom Slayer has a fun new arsenal of weapons to play with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366689-doomdarkages_0002_doomthedarkages_announce_04.jpg"></figure><p>Some of the best arsenals in video games can be found in the Doom games, and The Dark Ages looks set to continue that tradition of outrageous firepower. So far, we've seen the Doom Slayer's signature super-shotgun, a plasma-firing assault rifle, a rifle that fires railroad stakes, and a weapon that grinds up skulls and turns them into deadly pieces of high-velocity shrapnel. Officially, this is called the Skullcrusher, but unofficially, we're calling this our head-cannon.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages shield</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366687-doomdarkages_0005_doomthedarkages_announce_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366687" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366687-doomdarkages_0005_doomthedarkages_announce_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366687"></a><figcaption>Even the toughest demons will be forced to yield to the shield.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366687-doomdarkages_0005_doomthedarkages_announce_01.jpg"></figure><p>Interestingly, The Dark Ages will also see the Doom Slayer wield a shield in combat, proving that the best defense is a metal-bladed shield-saw that can be thrown through demons as if you were a bloodthirsty version of Captain America. Not only can you block attacks and push through enemy fire with the shield, but you'll even be able to parry enemies when you nail the timing of it. In the brief snippet of gameplay we've seen so far, the Doom Slayer hurls the shield like a demonic frisbee through cannon fodder enemies, ricochets off a wall to do even more damage, and catches it in one fluid motion, readying it for use against the legions of Hell.</p><p>While you'll have to wait until 2025 to feel what it's like in action, one enterprising modder has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-cool-ass-doom-the-dark-ages-shield-has-been-modded-into-og-doom/1100-6524198/" data-ref-id="1100-6524198">inserted it into the original Doom game</a>.</p><h2>Can you ride a dragon in Doom: The Dark Ages?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366688-doomdarkages_0004_doomthedarkages_announce_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366688-doomdarkages_0004_doomthedarkages_announce_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366688"></a><figcaption>The bar has officially been raised for dragons in video games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366688-doomdarkages_0004_doomthedarkages_announce_02.jpg"></figure><p>Hell yeah, you can!

			<p>Just a couple of weeks ago, Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with Annapurna to co-finance (with an even split) the development of Control 2, as well as to develop movies and TV shows based on the Control and Alan Wake IPs.</p>
<p>When it was discovered that Annapurna Interactive's entire team had resigned, fans were understandably worried about the fate of the aforementioned partnership. However, Remedy Communications Director Thomas Puha <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1834409934202589679" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the deal was actually with Annapurna Pictures and is, therefore, unaffected.</p>
<p><em>Many of you are reaching out about the news around Annapurna (sorry to see what is going on to all involved ) Interactive. Thank you for your care! Remedy's deal for Control 2, including Alan Wake and Control AV rights, is with Annapurna Pictures, and we are self-publishing Control 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Remedy is currently working on the second Alan Wake 2 DLC, titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lake House</a>. Here's the premise of this DLC slated to launch at some point next month:</p>
<p><em>The Lake House is a mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organization to conduct secret research… until something goes wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>Explore the Lake House and embark on an adventure as the realities of the Pacific Northwest and the Dark Place collide again.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Control 2, which is in the 'production readiness' stage, Remedy is also cooking the Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remakes (for Rockstar) and Project Condor, a multiplayer spin-off based on the Control IP. On the other hand, in May, the Finnish game developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-cancels-co-op-multiplayer-game-project-kestrel-formerly-vanguard-will-focus-on-alan-wake-and-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> the live service game Project Kestrel. Formerly known as Project Vanguard, it was conceived as a free-to-play game to be published in partnership with Tencent. It was later rebooted as a premium game, but even this new incarnation didn't last.</p>
<p>By the way, other Annapurna Interactive projects like Wanderstop and Mixtape are also reportedly unaffected by the division's demise.</p>

At the end of the day, it’s still fun as hell to drop into increasingly ravenous hordes of enemies, be they killer bugs or robots, and wage a constantly escalating and satirized war against them. It’s still fun to dive just out of the way of a barrage of missiles and land a well-placed shot from an autocannon into the weak spot of an enemy just in the nick of time. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>regularly churns out incredible stories of survival and endurance (or just baffling good luck) in the face of all odds, and that’s what the game’s all about. <strong>You can dive into hell with some good friends and kill some bad bugs by picking up </strong><em><strong>Helldivers 2 </strong></em><strong>for just $32 on </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/553850/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/553850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam</strong></a></span><strong> and </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhelldivers-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhelldivers-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Humble</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Throughout the PS3’s lifetime, Naughty Dog put itself on the map by releasing the first three <em>Uncharted </em>games to widespread acclaim and popularity. These action-adventure games made a household name of protagonist Nathan Drake, who became the generation’s golden boy and made the franchise Sony’s prized possession. Though the studio would eventually move on to <em>The Last of Us </em>(more on that in a bit) Naughty Dog did come back in 2016 to properly finish Nate’s story with <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End </em>and its 2017 spinoff, <em>The Lost Legacy</em>. I happen to like these last two installments quite a lot, with the former putting a neat bow on Nate’s story that leaves the door propped open for other protagonists and tales, which allows <em>The Lost Legacy </em>to deliver on by letting us play as his longtime ally Chloe Frazer in an adventure that rivals the mainline games’ best stuff. These are also the two games that come bundled together in the <em>Legacy of Thieves Collection</em>, which uprezzed either title for the PS5 and brought them to the PC in the first place. <strong>Now, you can tackle some of the series’ best setpieces and heartfelt moments by snagging </strong><em><strong>Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection </strong></em><strong>for $25 on </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Funcharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Funcharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Humble</strong></a></span><strong>, or </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/uncharted_legacy_of_thieves_collection&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/uncharted_legacy_of_thieves_collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GOG</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’ve got a soft spot for Insomniac’s <em>Spider-Man </em>games. I can’t help it. He’s been my favorite hero since I was a kid and my whole life has been dominated by him. I grew up with the Sam Raimi flicks, watched the Sony-produced <em>Amazing Spider-Man </em>movies as a teenager, and by the time Tom Holland took over the role in the MCU, I was a young adult who’d spent a lifetime admiring the friendly neighborhood superhero. I love that he’s just a kid from New York—whether it’s Peter in Queens or Miles in Harlem—and that he lives like the rest of us and has to pay rent by slinging pizza and taking crappy jobs around town. Dropping me into his shoes is always going to go over pretty well, and the <em>Spider-Man </em>games are respectable blockbusters with a lot of heart and some of the breeziest storytelling and gameplay in the AAA space.<br></p><p>It is so <em>easy</em> to enjoy the fantasy of swinging around the city as either Peter or Miles and it never fails to produce a grin or a boost to my mood to zip around and do things Spider-Man would do. Both are also easy heroes to root for, and Insomniac’s version of Peter might be the most personable and down-to-earth take on the guy ever.

Everything from the movement and gunplay to the trickle of abilities and upgrades is finely tuned in <em>Returnal</em>, but it’s really the presentation that takes the cake. Helios feels alien. Its structures and biomes resemble our own, but there’s a menacing aura about them. The planet feels like it’s withholding something crucial from Selene, and no matter how hard she tries, she can’t seem to crack it.

<section><p>Astro Bot could very well be the best PlayStation exclusive for this console generation--and an opportunity for Sony to refocus.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>PlayStation is not what it used to be; some of that, of course, is for good reason. You'd be hard-pressed to argue that Cloud Strife looked better when he was a pile of polygons, or that stealth-game controls peaked with 1998's Metal Gear Solid. Technology has evolved, bringing us not necessarily <em>better </em>games but games offering visuals and overall experiences that were previously unfathomable. And just as technology has changed, so have the companies implementing it--companies like Sony.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally a home for RPGs and platforming mascots, PlayStation has spent the past few decades intensely focused on cinematic single-player games, with narratives that eschew early-aughts whimsy in favor of morally conflicted anti-heroes. Despite the incongruity between those two styles, both were hugely successful for the company. But now, PlayStation is changing its focus yet again, only this time into an arena so competitive that there's no guarantee even this titan of video games will see any measure of success: live-service games. So far, the company's path to success has been bumpy, but it quietly might have just taken a big step in the right direction towards achieving its goal.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in 2022, Sony decided to be up front about its vision for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/">the future of PlayStation</a>, revealing to investors that PlayStation Studios has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-planning-to-invest-heavily-into-live-service-games-with-bungie-buyout/1100-6500131/">"an aggressive road map with live services"</a> and was aiming to launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/">"more than 10 live-service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026."</a> Sony executive deputy president and interim CEO Hiroku Totoki stated that this was part of the company's overall plan to "expand into the live-game services area," which was yielding success for studios like Epic, MiHoYo, and Bungie, the latter of which was already in the process of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-acquired-by-sony-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/">acquired by Sony</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366697-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366697" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366697-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366697"></a><figcaption>A Destiny 2 character confronts enemies.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366697-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yet things haven't been going quite as planned at the company. For starters, it's been reported that a number of employees were upset by former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandated pivot towards live-service games</a>--a fact that is not all that surprising considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/poll-shows-majority-of-game-devs-worry-about-live-service-sustainability/1100-6522748/">developers' concerns regarding live-service stability</a>. According to former PlayStation developer David Jaffe, the creator of Twisted Metal and co-creator of God of War, this was part of the reason that long-time PlayStation developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">Connie Booth was reportedly fired</a>. Jaffe claimed that multiple sources told him that Booth "was somehow blamed" for the initiative. Though the truth behind Booth's departure is not entirely clear, the outcome was the end of her 30-year career at Sony, during which she played a key role in producing Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Jak &amp; Daxter, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Sly, Marvel's Spider-Man, Resistance, Uncharted, Infamous, and The Last of Us.</p><p dir="ltr">A month later, Totoki informed investors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">only half of the promised live-service titles would be ready by Spring 2026</a>. This was followed by the news that two of its live-service titles--a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/">The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-twisted-metal-live-service-game-canceled-report/1100-6521393/">an unannounced Twisted Metal project</a>--we're being scrapped entirely. Though the reason the Twisted Metal title was scrapped is not clear, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog was quick to release a statement following the news, writing:</p><p dir="ltr">"To release and support The Last of Us Online we'd have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post-launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games. So, we had two paths in front of us: Become a solely live-service-games studio or continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog's heritage."</p><p dir="ltr">In February 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/">Sony announced it was laying off 900 employees</a> in a move that would eliminate its VR-focused London studio and affect production at Firesprite, Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, and Guerrilla. Layoffs continued later that summer, when the Sony-owned studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-plans-to-optimize-overall-studio-structure-at-bungie-following-destiny-layoffs/1100-6525636/">Bungie laid off 17% of its workforce</a>, and then migrated 12% of its remaining staff to other departments at PlayStation. Despite this news, however, Totoki reaffirmed that Sony would continue to go all-in on live-service titles.</p><p dir="ltr">In that same briefing, Sony stated it had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-major-sony-franchise-game-releases-are-coming-until-april-2025-at-earliest/1100-6521071/">unable to meet its goal</a> of selling 25 million PS5s during the current financial year--causing it to revise its projection to 21 million sales and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-loses-10-billion-in-market-value-due-to-ps5-sales-forecast-cut/1100-6521224/">lose $10 billion in market value</a>--and that the PS5 was now in the "latter stage" of its life cycle. Fortunately, one of Sony's promised live-service titles, Concord, was almost ready to launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366699-feb498bc7a874470e7ff763b7935460b21442b0c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366699" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366699-feb498bc7a874470e7ff763b7935460b21442b0c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366699"></a><figcaption>A space ship console in Concord.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366699-feb498bc7a874470e7ff763b7935460b21442b0c.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yet when Concord finally launched in August 2024, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-big-new-ps5-and-pc-game-concord-got-off-to-a-slow-start/1100-6526101/">met with little fanfare</a>. Upon release, the game peaked at a dismal 697 concurrent users on Steam. And while PlayStation 5 player numbers are not publicly available, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/100138/concord-is-511-on-steams-top-sellers-list-but-42-the-playstation-store/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Tweaktown</a> discovered that Concord ranked at No. 50 on the PlayStation Store's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/d0446d4b-dc9a-4f1e-86ec-651f099c9b29/2" rel="nofollow ">PS5 best-sellers chart</a>. Two weeks after launch, Sony announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/">removing the game from sale and shutting down its servers</a>. The game may return in the future, but this was not the new foothold in the live-service space that Sony was surely hoping for.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all of this, Sony recently revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/">PS5 is getting an upgraded model</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">PS5 Pro</a>. However, the upcoming console's $700 price tag--and that's without the $80 disc drive you can<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/"> purchase separately</a>, mind you-- the lack of dramatic technical differences between the PS5 and PS5 Pro, and Sony's overall lack of PS5 exclusive titles, means this announcement was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/">largely met with scorn</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I think Sony has an opportunity to course correct.</p><p dir="ltr">On September 6, PlayStation released Astro Bot, a charming platformer with a ton of heart and absolutely glowing reviews. On the surface, the game is a celebration of PlayStation and its history, as throughout it, you unlock bots that are made to look like some of the consoles' greatest characters--both from exclusive titles and third-party games notably associated with the company--all while piloting a PS5 controller. Yet to dismiss the game as pure Sony nostalgia, or reduce it as an ode to the unfortunate IP collectathon currently happening in the games industry, discredits what makes it truly special.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/">As GameSpot's Mark Delaney put so eloquently</a>, Astro Bot is "a platformer whose incredible ambition is matched by its brilliant execution." It feels fantastic to play, offers bountiful exciting mechanics that--while different--never feel disparate, and creates gorgeous worlds that feel natural to explore yet constantly surprise and delight. It's a game that rivals the likes of Super Mario Odyssey and beyond that, it's <em>fun</em>. Pure, wondrous fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366706-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366706-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366706"></a><figcaption>Astro Bot glides through the air alongside flamingos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366706-ps2slim%2814%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In recent years, Sony has proven it can tell a great story. Their exclusive titles are known for their complex characters, emotional narratives, and well-conceived worlds. But in the midst of all that, it feels like Sony forgot about the joy of simple fun. It forgot about all the different kinds of players that exist, and what they long to see. And it forgot about all the series that, while heralded in Astro Bot, have effectively disappeared.</p><p dir="ltr">Though folks online love to call me a Sony Pony anytime I throw any sort of criticism at Xbox--here's hoping this piece clears that up a bit!--the only time I truly felt like a Sony fangirl was when I was a child. I remember the transition from the Nintendo 64 to the PlayStation--it absolutely blew my mind. I remember the variety of games my family obtained over the course of a few years: Tomb Raider, Spider-Man, Time Crisis, Spyro the Dragon, Crash Bandicoot, Silent Hill, Tekken, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, and a small mountain of Final Fantasy games, my family's favorite. When the Xbox launched in 2001, I saw zero reason I would ever need it. I already had my portal to every world I could ever want to visit.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, I'd eventually find a lot of value in Xbox and return to Nintendo, and these days, I don't feel a closeness to PlayStation anymore. I'm sure this is partially due to my age and how the years inevitably come with a loss of childlike whimsy, but I know there are other factors, too. I'm not jaded, I still love games, and I could <em>easily</em> list dozens that have come out even in the last few years that I think are phenomenal. But to me, PlayStation just doesn't quite feel <em>special </em>anymore. But Astro Bot does. And it also reminds me of how it used to feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Astro Bot feels like a chance to reignite the brand's charm and perhaps even alter what live-service means for PlayStation, if that's the path it intends to walk down. Whereas it seems like Sony is sticking to a very particular type of live-service game--one that is oversaturated and that it can't seem to quite find an audience for, as Concord's lack of success would indicate--the company has already revealed a plan to add more characters and levels to Astro Bot, and it could easily add more. It'd certainly make sense; it's a game that feels simple to expand upon and has a foundation sturdy enough to cradle that expansion. Why continue to toil over creating a fun live-service title that sticks when you have a game that is proven to be fun and whose structure lends itself to being expanded?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366705-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366705" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366705-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366705"></a><figcaption>A bot is dressed as God of War's Kratos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366705-ps2slim%2814%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sure, this doesn't fit the bill when it comes to satisfying PlayStation's desire to create a Forever Game--one that incentivizes players to log in daily, participate in seasonal content, and, to put it plainly, fork over cash on things like battle passes, skins, and loot boxes. But why is this well-established (and increasingly criticized) model the only way forward? Players have begun to see the vast majority of them for what they are: a somewhat predatory way to continuously rake in money. Games, and the amount of money companies are willing to spend making them, are growing monstrous in size yet it feels as if developers are forced to work in the confines of a narrow, short-sighted scope. It's easy to see where this leads, and it's not a place I want to see the industry go.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet at my most cynical and business-minded, Astro Bot still feels like a revenue booster, as it is a fantastic marketing opportunity for the company. Much like how Super Smash Bros. is said to have <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/98904/how-super-smash-bros-melee-introduced-fire-emblem-to-western-audiences" rel="nofollow ">contributed to Fire Emblem's success in the West</a>, Sony now has a great avenue to introduce new characters, showcase indies, reignite interest in previous titles, and gauge what audiences are responding to or demand more of. When I played through Astro Bot, there were certain characters I didn't know and was compelled to learn more about, as well as others that I had simply forgotten about but was delighted to see again. It made me want to buy and install games I hadn't thought about in years. And it goes beyond the generation who grew up with these characters; my two-year-old son was <em>fascinated</em> by Spyro, which led to me redownloading the Reignited Trilogy and spending an hour introducing him to the feisty little dragon. This is the power that game currently wields, and it's not a small one.</p><p dir="ltr">But beyond that, Astro Bot also proves that Sony can still do different types of games exceptionally well. It proves that Sony is still innovative, and its games still fun. Before Astro Bot, I couldn't tell you the last time a PlayStation platformer <em>truly </em>gave a Nintendo platformer a run for its money, but here we are. I wish Sony knew it doesn't necessarily need to pursue live-service. In fact, I'd argue it shouldn't. There are other paths to success--paths that invest in studios' unique visions, foster creativity, and delight players.</p><p>I can't claim to know if the live-service bubble has truly burst or if the market is grossly oversaturated to the point where no room remains, but I do know that myself and <em>many</em> others are certainly fatigued by it all. The money-grabbing is as transparent as the stagnation, and something needs to change. Here's hoping that Sony can sense that too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x World of Warcraft | Collaboration Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As part of the event, Blizzard says players will be able to choose to represent WoW's two main factions, the Horde or the Alliance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Join the celebration as Overwatch 2 and World of Warcraft unite the realms for a legendary crossover event," the trailer's description reads. "Choose to represent the Horde or the Alliance as the mighty heroes of Overwatch honor the iconic characters from the world of Azeroth."</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting this isn't the first time WoW-themed skins have been available in Overwatch, nor the first time Blizzard's shooter has crossed over with another Blizzard property. Skins turning Doomfist into Orc warchief Blackhand, an Illidan Stormrage skin for Genji, and two skins for Symetra (one turning her into a Blood Elf, another transforming her into Night Elf leader Tyrande Whisperwind), have previously been available. There is already an existing Magni Bronzebeard skin for Torbjorn as well, though the new skin seen in the trailer shows him in his diamond "Speaker of Azeroth" form.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch's last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-7-is-getting-a-hellish-crossover-with-diablo-4/1100-6518115/" data-ref-id="1100-6518115">Blizzard crossover was themed around Diablo 4</a>, and introduced a new PvE game mode where players collected power-ups to face off against enemies like Azmodan Wrecking Ball, Butcher Roadhog, and Lilith Moira.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how WoW itself is celebrating its 20th birthday, Blizzard announced it will be releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">massive 20th-anniversary update</a> for the game later this year, filled with activities and rewards that harken back to the MMO's early days. Overwatch 2, meanwhile, recently introduced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-12-introduces-juno-lets-players-become-egyptian-gods/1100-6525795/" data-ref-id="1100-6525795">newest support hero, Juno</a>.</p>
