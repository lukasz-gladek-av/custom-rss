		<p>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Medieval III, a fresh historical entry in the long-running grand strategy series. So long-running, in fact, that this announcement came for the 25th anniversary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Unfortunately, you shouldn’t expect this game to launch especially soon. Total War: Medieval 3 is currently in early pre-production, but the ambition is to create a game that acts as both a tribute to the classic, and as a revolutionary new entry to push it forward.</p>
<p>The press release reads, “Built as the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox, it will empower players to shape realms, rewrite history, and immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before. Combining meticulous historical authenticity with unprecedented player agency, this is more than a sequel, it’s the rebirth of historical Total War.”</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the studio also talked about the game engine that they use, revealing Warcore to be the next evolution of their proprietary engine. This will be the new foundation for games and capabilities to be built around, but it’s also been designed with console gaming in mind. Total War will be coming to PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

<p>Medieval: Total War was the second game in the franchise, arriving in 2002 after the original game’s Japanese setting. It was followed four years later by Medieval II: Total War in 2006, so it will have been two decades between games that have visited this tumultuous period of European history.</p>
<p>To be fair, it’s been a good long while since a full fat Total War had a historical setting. Total War Saga: Troy and Total War: Pharaoh were smaller scale experiences, so the last main game would be 2019’s Three Kingdoms. It’s the fantasy wargaming of Total War: Warhammer 3 that arrived most recently in 2022.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the support for that game continues – Total War: Warhammer itself celebrating 10 years – with the Lords of The End Times Pack set to unleash four new Legendary Lords into the Immortal Empires campaign in Summer 2026, alongside an End Times update for free.</p>

            <guid>1373362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Before <a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-warhammer-iii-3-review-pc-kotaku-creative-ass-1848519660"><em>Total War: Warhammer</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-the-kotaku-review-1834993637"><em>Total War: Three Kingdoms</em></a>, there was <em>Total War: Medieval</em> and its successor, <em>Total War: Medieval II</em>. It’s been a long wait. Almost two decades, in fact. But the hit strategy series is going back to Europe. Creative Assembly marked the franchise’s 25-year anniversary on Thursday by announcing <em>Total War: Medieval III</em>.</p> <p>The next <em>Total War</em> promises a return to the series roots but also a future-facing evolution. Here’s the press release:</p> <blockquote><p>Now in early pre-production, this next chapter is both a tribute to its legendary predecessors and a bold revolution for the series. Built as the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox, it will empower players to shape realms, rewrite history, and immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before. Combining meticulous historical authenticity with unprecedented player agency, this is more than a sequel, it’s the rebirth of historical&nbsp;<em><span>Total War</span></em>.</p></blockquote> <p>And here’s the live-action teaser:</p>  <p>When’s the game actually coming out? Who knows. It sounds pretty far away, though Creative Assembly is promising a more detailed tease at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards 2025</a> next week. <em>Medieval III</em> will be built in the next iteration of the studio’s proprietary Warcore game development engine, and will also be the first game in the series to come to “PlayStation and Xbox.” Not specifying “PS5” or “Xbox Series X/S” suggests it very likely might be arriving closer to the launch of the PS6 and next-gen Xbox.</p>

 <p>“Please DO NOT mess this one up,” one fan wrote on YouTube. “We have waited 20 years for a new Medieval Total War. Please release a fully functional and fun game.” Another was simply relieved: “<span dir="auto" role="text">I did not expect that this would happen before I die.”</span></p>

 <p>The original <em>Medieval</em> was the third game in the Total War series, and Creative Assembly hasn’t revisited that particular offshoot of its branching strategy franchise since 2006. Here’s how former <em>Kotaku</em> editor Luke Plunkett described <em>Medieval II</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-total-war-games-from-best-to-worst-1535642069">in his ranking of the series</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Perhaps the purest expression of melee battlefield combat the series has seen, its modern replayability is let down by an archaic strategic component. Which is a shame, because this is the last great moddable&nbsp;<em>Total War</em>, and as such is still home to all kinds of wild projects,&nbsp;<a href="https://thebests.kotaku.com/the-best-lord-of-the-rings-video-games-1820380737">including a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;total conversion</a>&nbsp;which would be close to the very top of this list…were it an actual game.</p></blockquote> <p>Hopefully, <em>Medieval III</em> can set a new standard for massive waves of melee units thrashing each other with more streamlined management elements. In the meantime, there’s no shortage of <em>Medieval II</em> mods to toy around with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Official Announce Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Wojs said fans can look forward to new updates about once a quarter. The last entry in the series, Medieval 2: Total War, was released all the way back in 2006.</p><p>But what is Medieval 3 all about? Wojs said the game aims to be the "ultimate 'What if?' game where you can alter the course of history."</p><p>"We aim to set the scene by immersing you in the historical authenticity you expect from Total War. As you play, the world responds in ways that feel genuinely plausible. You can choose to follow the course as written in the history books or take a bold step towards rewriting it," he said.</p><p>The developer went on to say it will have more to show and discuss over time, and that the studio will "give you a voce to shape certain decisions."</p><p>"But game development is challenging, so we're only going to be able to discuss certain areas when we're confident they're ready to be shown. Through this, we hope to provide more insight than ever before into the development of a Total War title. We're going to make some mistakes, but we're excited to make this journey with you," he explained.</p><p>He went on to say that Creative Assembly wanted to make Medieval 3 for "a very long time" already, and the studio "made attempts to bring it to life in the past, but we never felt we could truly do it justice."</p><p>It's happening now--some 19 years after the last game, 2006's Medieval 2: Total War--for a variety of reasons, including the fact that Creative Assembly is using an updated version of its Warcore engine that is more powerful and feature-rich. Creative Assembly also waited until it could find the right people to make Medieval 3.</p><p>"It was essential to bring together the right people--a team with decades of experience and a deep understanding of what makes historical strategy so compelling," he said. "This expertise, combined with the passion of those who helped shape the series, gives us the foundation to build something truly special."</p><p>Medieval 3 is now in "early pre-production," so it is still "years away," Wojs said. "This phase is about laying the foundations: defining scope, prioritizing features which number in the hundreds at this stage, and shaping how our vision will translate into an unforgettable experience," he explained.</p><p>Wojs went on to say people should expect some "bumps and bruises" in the process of talking to fans about Medieval 3, in part because the studio has never discussed an upcoming game with fans so early in the process. "So please bear with us whilst we find our rhythm," he said.</p>

They're efforts to bring fictional characters to life in the real world in a manner that can organically interact with park guests and aren't just a person in a costume or mask. They're the non-playable characters (NPCs) of video games brought to the physical world.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-goes-into-a-good-parry-system-" target="_self" data-discover="true">What goes into a good parry system?</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyIgV84fudM?si=Dti7ODXPL_uDvrUc" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kevin describes these characters as a "broken promise" because Disney has regularly made (legally defensible) claims that these characters will populate its parks and resorts, but they often appear in a diminished or limited fashion. The reasons are multilayered, and include the challenges of operational logistics, the realities of R&amp;D, and the company's appeals to investors. The full video includes a breakdown of the time Imagineers terrified executives with a giant mechanical dinosaur and an an amazing swipe at Walt Disney for getting his just desserts by being reanimated as an animatronic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Kevin picks through the graveyard of these Living Characters to scrutinize Disney's claims, game developers can loot the open coffins for a number of surprising lessons pulled from real-life NPC design (you aren't allowed to say that's ghoulish if you work on a game where players loot dead bodies).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/news-tower-is-designed-to-nourish-your-inner-history-freak-" target="_self" data-discover="true">News Tower is designed to nourish your inner 'history freak'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Character choice matters">Character choice matters</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The living character initiative showed that a character's personality—and audience familiarity with them—plays a major psychological role in how players interact with a game or feature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the successful living characters that made it from R&amp;D all the way to Disney's parks is Turtle Talk With Crush, a theater-based experience where guests can chat with the laid-back turtle character from Finding Nemo. The attraction is effectively digital puppeteering, where a human actor chats with a theater full of families while a digital model of Crush tracks their movements, using a mix of canned animations and real-time tracking to create the illusion of an animated character physically interacting with the real world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Defunctland, Turtle Talk With Crush evolved from two other prototypes: Stitch's Picture Phone and Mickey's Toon Elevator. The latter experience was Disney's first attempt at letting guests talk to interactive animated characters, featuring its flagship mascot Mickey Mouse. The technology was repurposed for the Lilo &amp; Stitch-themed attraction Stitch's Picture Phone, which was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/u-_pCkTnRPo?si=ygnsSzfqCzkbxaUF">tested with guests</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in Disneyworld's "Innovations" experiment in Tomorrowland.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/creating-the-card-based-rpg-battle-suit-aces-game-developer-podcast-ep-59" target="_self" data-discover="true">Creating the card-based RPG Battle Suit Aces - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 59</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The choice to put Stitch and Crush in these experiences wasn't purely about film promotion. Defunctland says that Imagineers faced concerns over what we now call "brand safety" for putting Mickey in such an exposed position—but more importantly, that guests might have a genuinely bad time if Mickey behaved in a way they didn't expect.</span></p><p>Image via Disney</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A throwaway comment or awkward social encounter wouldn't fit their image of Disney's magnanimous mouse, the upbeat perfect host whose behavior and voice has been documented through a century of animation. Because only three actors (including Walt Disney himself) played the beloved mouse, a park actor who couldn't nail the slightest nuances of Mickey's voice could unsettle guests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stitch, Crush, and other Park animatronic park characters speaking with guests don't carry that baggage. More importantly, their personalities afford flexibility when interacting with guests of different backgrounds. "There's no expectation Stitch would provide any level of attention or emotional concern," Kevin noted in his video.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If a guest is rude to Stitch, it's in-character for him to have a sassy retort or hiss and walk away. Crush has the vibe of a laid-back California </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>stoner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> surfer and any sarcasm or diversions from errant guest behavior come off as playful and relaxed since he doesn't seem to care about anything. These also soften the blow of technical glitches or awkward pauses in conversation, letting the mere marvel of speaking with a cartoon do the heavy lifting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That freedom has limits. Defunctland noted how strange it is that so many park actors hit on guests, and too much riffing can feel like a bad comedian doing crowdwork, flattening what makes these characters special. But the mere existence of a "sweet spot" for character interactions and the popularity of features like Turtle Time With Crush shows is measurable data about how the right personality can make or break a player's experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There's a thin line between attraction and distraction">There's a thin line between attraction and distraction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why doesn't Disney's Star Wars-themed Galaxy's Edge attraction feel like a fully-inhabited fantasy world? What if it's because filling it with Living Characters could disrupt the flow of the park?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fellow video essayists like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=mRTzB62sYMxCzER3">Jenny Nicholson</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> argued in her popular 2024 video about Disney's now-shuttered Starcruiser hotel that it felt like Disney had made big, expensive promises then cut corners by putting the most premium role-playing experiences in an expensive hotel, one of many cost-reductions measures across Disneyland and Disneyworld. Kevin echoed this argument in his Defunctland essay.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you spend years promoting a land as a living, breathing place where you can immerse yourself in a Star Wars story, and build an environment that appears to be designed for Living Characters and interactions, and you accomplish this for one day when the media is there to review it, regular guests get a little upset," Kevin noted, also laying out how the division between different division's marketing and operations budgets shape when and where characters appear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in the video's closing moments, he spotlighted design nuances that may show Disney should have never made those promises to begin with: Living Characters are crowd-drawing attractions unto themselves, and their realism may be so mind-boggling it undermines any role-playing potential.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 1963 when Disney unveiled the Enchanted Tiki Room attraction, it promoted the restaurant full of animatronic talking birds with a single animatronic barker sitting outside the building that caught guest's attention. Guests paid attention all right. They gathered around the parrot, blocking access to the attraction.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The animatronic was quickly shuffled away.</span></p><p>Image via Disney</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2017 Disney tested "J4KE The Droid," a Star Wars droid autonomously wandering through Disneyland's Tomorrowland area of the park. Guests would block J4KE's path to take photos with their kids. Kids walked up and kicked and grabbed J4KE.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the last couple years, with the rollout of the new "BD-X" droids (distant cousins of BD-1, the companion droid from Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi series), park attendants have had to constantly follow the little duck-like machines as they waddle through the park, again warding off errant children and managing the crowds that stop to watch them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These moments spotlight a fascinating tension in game design. In live-action or digital role-playing experience aliens and droids wandering a town are meant to feel organic, even boring. They simulate the everyday life of a fictional world and players treat them as such. In a park, they are amazing creations that draw the eye away from events.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to avoid the complexity at the heart of this dynamic. If you asked ChatGPT for a key lesson, it would likely say "designers need to consider player traffic when designing levels."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kevin's observation is that humans are flawed creatures and these flaws make Living Characters in public spaces untenable. "Even if Mickey Mouse could be a fully autonomous bipedal animatronic with character-specific language learning model and perfect speech synthesis, that Mickey could not shake your hand when you enter the park and walk with you to get an ice cream because the costumed Mickey [actor] can't do that. He would be mobbed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But developers would benefit if they can zoom out to the biggest picture possible. My takeaway: context can drastically alter the very nature of a game experience, and the subtle differences can sometimes be difficult to perceive or describe. A small group encounter with a Living Character is immersive. A crowd encounter is a show. The instance when one moment becomes another is blurry, and it can be easy to not see when the context has shifted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Human psychology, however well documented, is remarkably fickle. But it can still be harnessed to make your game sing when artificiality struggles to keep up.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The human touch matters">The human touch matters</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/is-nvidia-s-ai-driven-npc-tech-just-really-expensive-improv-">written before</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about my experiences at Galaxy's Edge and how actors playing the characters of Kylo Ren and Vi Moradi offered different flavors of how to delight and deter guests in the park. Defunctland drove home how, despite the passion from Disney (the man and the company) for autonomous interactions, human choices are what delight players and park guests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, watch my interaction with Kylo Ren for a sample of this dynamic at play.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNegoSdHmBA?si=FY1iHzHFrTGR2M5N?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As an interaction between a would-be Supreme Leader and undercover Resistance operative, it's boring. As a personalized moment for a guest at the park, it felt amazing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Defunctland highlighted what was almost the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>opposite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reaction of this from video of the guest experience in the Starcruiser hotel. The hotel rooms contained what may have been one of the most advanced Living Characters ever created: a maitre'de droid named D3-09. D3 was an advanced interactive chatbot who interacts with guests as part of their adventure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Most guests reported growing bored with D3-09 quickly, while finding the interactions with the human performers rewarding and engaging," Kevin explained. Children apparently found the droid more engaging, but children also "think costumed characters are real." He laid out how most concepts for designing artificial intelligence operate on the idea that the human interacting with the machine will be operating in good faith. But they may not even need to be operating in bad faith to undo the magic. It can evaporate if they're confused or inattentive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Human interaction—direct or indirect—is much more sticky. In an in-person encounter, an actor can look at the people around them and intuit what behavior will provoke a certain response. In game design, developers customize different interactions with some sense of what the player will feel on other side. Even in procedural content or emergent multiplayer experiences, the strongest emotions emerge when one human looks at another over some distance and thinks "I want this person to feel this way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Achieving the illusion of life does not necessarily require fully-autonomous free-roaming self-directed character agents," Kevin said in his four-hour video essay's final moments. "You can create something that feels immersive and alive without expecting guests to shift their behavior in a major way."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-where-to-find-scout-bot-guide/</link>
            <guid>1373320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the curious things you will stumble across early on when playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is a lifeless scout bot crumpled to the floor. What does it do? Can it be revived? Where are there more of them? That’s what we’ll set out to answer in this quick guide</p>
<h2>What do Scout Bots do in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Scout Bots are, to put it simply, item locators. Once activated, they will spring into action, marking all of the remaining items within a region on your map for you, so that you can fully power up Samus.</p>
<h2>How can you activate Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Activating a Scout Bot needs you to shoot it with some electrical juice to power it up. This means you need a lightning gun, which is one of the later unlocks for Samus’ new suit of armour in Metroid Prime 4. This is very much a late-game kind utility, for when players have the majority of Samus’ abilities and can actually reach and grab almost all of the items that a Scout Bot will locate.</p>


<h2>Where are all of the Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>There is one Scout Bot located in each region on Viewros, and if you’re attentive as you explore each location, chances are you’ll find all of the Scout Bots. You can make a note of which room and general area they are in using markers on the map (or by making a written note). Or… well, here’s where they all are:</p>
<h3>Fury Green</h3>
<p>Right near the start of the area, you’ll find the Scout Bot in the room branching off from the main path. You really can’t miss it… but you might forget exactly where to go by the time you can activate it!</p>


		
		

<h3>Volt Forge</h3>
<p>The Scout Bot in Volt Forge is tucked a little out of the way down on the side platform of the second generator. That could be quite a chore to get back to, but it’s much easier later in the game.</p>
<p>From the entrance area of Tower 1, head to the elevator opposite the Save Station room. Instead of taking the elevator, scan for a pipe on the right side of the room, which you can rip open using the Psychic Lasso. Hop in as a Morph Ball and this takes you down to the side of the generator of Tower 1.</p>
<p>Use the Psychic Grapple to swing across to the main platform of Tower 1’s Generator, then head straight over to the other side platform and scan for a Psychic Boost Rail. Roll in with the Morph Ball and boost to shoot yourself across to Tower 2’s Generator. Battle the robots here and on the other side platform you will find your Scout Bot. Also… there’s maybe an item near here!</p>

		
		

<h2>Ice Belt</h2>
<p>This one’s super simple. The Scout Bot is off to the side of the frozen wasteland where you have the battle with the pack of wolves. Return here and look to the right and side as you come down the slope to see it.</p>

<h2>Flare Pool</h2>
<p>Another easy to reach one. Drive through the opening area of Flare Pool to reach the shut down bridge and river of lava that you had to cross to reach the main facility. Bike across the lava and head to the right hand side of the maintenance grate. Hop over the bollards and you’ll find the scout bot and a little puzzle to complete once you’ve unlocked the Morph Ball tether.</p>

		
		

<h2>Sol Valley</h2>
<p>Sol Valley’s Scout Bot is pretty handy, given just how big and open space it is! You’ll actually be able to reach the Scout Bot right from where you first land in this region. If you’re coming out of Volt Forge, turn left after exiting the structure and you should see an island just detached from the cliff edge to the world. Activate some Psychic Platforms to jump across and you’ll find the Scout Bot here.</p>

		
		

<h2>Great Mines</h2>
<p>And finally, the Great Mines. I’ll keep things pretty light here, as we’re getting towards the end of the game. See a big spiky green thing? It’s to the left.</p>

		
		

<p>And that’s all of them! With the Scout Bots collected, you’ve still got time for hunting down all the remaining items you have to get Samus fully kitted out for the game’s grand finale. Good luck with that!</p>

Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Now in early pre-production, this next chapter is both a tribute to its legendary predecessors and a bold revolution for the series. Built as the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox, it will empower players to shape realms, rewrite history, and immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before. Combining meticulous historical authenticity with unprecedented player agency, this is more than a sequel, it’s the rebirth of historical Total War.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Total War: Warhammer 3 - Lords of the End Times announced</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Next came Total War: Warhammer 3 - Lords of the End Times, which coincides with the subseries’ 10th year. The Lords of The End Times Pack adds four new Legendary Lords into the Immortal Empires campaign experience in summer 2026. The first to be revealed is the great necromancer, Nagash, who returns to reclaim his lost power and drown the world in undeath. These new lords also herald the arrival of the free End Times Update. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Taking inspiration from the lore, players will face a campaign experience transformed, with apocalyptic scenarios and cataclysmic events that push the boundaries of strategy and survival. And to crown this update, a new Legendary Lord will rise, ready to leave their mark on the cataclysm to come.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Assembly ended the announcement by saying there’s more to come from Total War: Warhammer, insisting “the series is far from over.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Warcore game engine to bring Total War to consoles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up was the announcement of the Warcore game engine, the latest version of Creative Assembly's own tech which allows for future Total War games to launch on console. Here’s what Creative Assembly had to say:</p><blockquote>Building on 25 years of strategy innovation, Warcore is the next evolution of Total War’s proprietary engine. As the most advanced technological foundation in the franchise’s history, it empowers developers with a suite of tools that allows for gameplay to be more immersive, dynamic and responsive than ever before. Designed to evolve over time, it will continue to unlock new capabilities, ensuring the franchise stays at the cutting edge of strategy gaming for years to come.

            <title><![CDATA[Horses Is Tame]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/</link>
            <guid>1373284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>While playing <em>Horses</em>, I was filled with dread for a revelation that never came. “This is creepy,” I thought, “but surely there’s some big thing in the next scene that pushes the envelope too far.” Yet despite the drama, I am here to tell you that <em>Horses</em>, the cause célèbre from Italian developer Santa Ragione that has now been prevented from being sold on <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>Steam</u></a> and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic Store</u></a> and was <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-santa-ragione-delisted-relisted-epic-steam/"><u>temporarily delisted from the Humble Store</u></a>, isn’t that troubling. Yes, it contains disturbing scenes of sexual violence and abuse, but so do many great works of art. The acts themselves are cartoonish, goofy, and self-censored. If this is what’s considered the limit for which games can and cannot be sold on mass marketplaces, then we’re all in trouble and everyone involved in that decision should be thoroughly embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Note: The following features images and plot details from the game <em>Horses</em> which some people may find disturbing.</strong> </p><h2 id="high-horse"><strong>High horse</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>In <em>Horses</em>, you play a 20 year old man named Anselmo who has been sent by his parents to work on a farm for the summer. The game is entirely in 4:3 black and white, and the sound of a film projector is heard in the background constantly, with speech rendered in text cards like a silent film. The farmer shows you around and introduces you to his livestock: a pen of “horses” that are actually just naked (yet blurred-out) people in horse masks. “These are my horses, they’re my pride and joy,” he says in subtitled Italian. You then proceed to get on a horse piggyback style and do a goofy jumping mini game while a player piano noodles in the background.</p><figure><figcaption><span>There's a lot of weird dinners with mouth noises, but the game provides a Misophonia warning at the beginning. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the game goes on you are instructed to do various errands around the farm (water the plants, chop wood, feed the “dog”) as revelations about the nature of the horses reveal themselves. The farmer tells you that fornication between horses is forbidden, and that you must report any horses that you catch in the act. You come to learn precisely why the horses are like that, what motivates the farmer, and witness various acts of punishment and sexual violence. Importantly, these acts are rarely shown explicitly; all nudity is censored, and much of what is done is occluded in a stylized way. It’s easy to draw immediate thematic parallels to Ionesco’s <em>Rhinoceros</em> or Peter Shaffer’s <em>Equus,</em> although the most obvious comparison is Pasolini’s <em>Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom</em>. Both are deeply Italian works about power, the body, and sexuality, although <em>Horses</em> is censored, does not feature real people, carries far less baggage, and is nowhere near as complex by comparison.</p><figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtkbDNNrFoY&amp;list=RDWtkbDNNrFoY&amp;start_radio=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"></a><figcaption><a href="https://youtu.be/WtkbDNNrFoY?si=AjzN9YULjy63DGUu&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>The farm</span></a><span>. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Horses</em> is a sophomoric game in both good and bad ways. The sex acts themselves often feel like the Unity asset version of two naked dolls being slapped together. Often this is funny, and the game can carry an absurd, cartoonish delivery that feels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distancing_effect?ref=aftermath.site"><u>intentionally alienating</u></a>. It is a cumbersome game to play, deliberately slow in the way that artful indie games tend to be. Its message and metaphors about sex and repression land with the subtlety of a brick, which I find a little charming in an Italian, absurdist way. But these scenes can overstay their welcome, and the symbolism feels, appropriately, a little tortured.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The broken man. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are moments of grief and loneliness I find genuinely striking in <em>Horses</em>. There is a scene of a gelded horse man on his knees in a field, his mask’s eyes dead and his will to live severed from him. He is broken. And yet there are other times where I found myself saying “I get it” as the various tasks take forever and their intent is obvious. Yet despite being long in the tooth at times, the message of <em>Horses </em>does land and is immediately parsable by anybody with a passing familiarity with any art form that isn’t video games. It’s a message that resonates far louder given that Valve and Epic seem terrified and deeply confused by a work that could not be any clearer if it tried.</p><h2 id="what-the-hay"><strong>What the Hay?</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>I don't think you can pet the "dog." Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>In different circumstances I do not think <em>Horses</em> would be controversial, a game mainly noteworthy among people who like intentionally unpleasant art horror games. To play it after all this is deflating; so much controversy over…this? This makes its de facto ban confusing, damning, and downright weird — it constantly feels like there’s a part of the story not being shared. I’ll concede that it is understandable that a game with this content would trigger alarm bells. Santa Ragione speculated that a scene in an early build where a “young girl” rides the shoulders of one of the horses may have led to Valve<a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> rejecting the game in 2023</u></a>. But they also claimed that they aged the girl up to an unambiguously grown woman and found it to work better in the context of the game – a point I agree with having actually played it and seen the content of the scene.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The scene in the final game. You walk a woman through a pen on a person's shoulders while she talks to you. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>The doubling down from Valve without any specificity or opportunity for appeal is damning enough, but the sudden 11th hour banning on the part of Epic raises eyebrows even further (Santa Ragione <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too?ref=aftermath.site"><u>says</u></a> the Humble delisting was temporary so the storefront could “reevaluate” the game.) Scandal sells, and this is great marketing on Santa Ragione’s part, or it would be if the way that PC games are sold was not <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>functionally oligopolistic</u></a> (although you can still buy the game on GoG, Humble and Itch). You need only play the game or watch a playthrough to realize just how embarrassing it is that this game has been made a pariah. This is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irr%C3%A9versible?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Irréversible</em></a>. But regardless of how you feel about <em>Horses</em>, it is undeniable that it has become an important work merely by existing and being deemed deviant.</p><p>Both Valve and Epic have been vague and contradictory about what triggered the bans, with the latter pointing to <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines?ref=aftermath.site"><u>policies</u></a> around “explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated” and a “‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy” that prohibits abuse of humans or animals. This can only be read as nonsensical ass covering, particularly in the light of Epic seemingly reapplying for the game’s IARC rating last minute, which is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolecarpenter.bsky.social/post/3m73wyv6tw225?ref=aftermath.site"><u>by all accounts</u></a> objectively weird behavior.</p><p>If the invalidating content was slavery, then <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Final Fantasy XVI</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fallout-new-vegas--ultimate-edition?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fallout: New Vegas</u></em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-origins-ultimate-edition-ca4fbf?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dragon Age: Origins</u></em></a> would never be allowed to be sold. If torture is unallowed, then <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/grand-theft-auto-v?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>GTA V</u></em></a><em> </em>violates Epic’s terms of service with “By The Book,” a mission where Trevor tortures a guy by pulling his teeth out with pliers and electrocuting his nipples on behalf of the government. Americans understand and respect graphic violence, torture, and abuse as art, and on that front <em>Horses </em>is far less graphic than any 30 seconds in a recent <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mortal-kombat-1?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Mortal Kombat</u></em></a><em> </em>game<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>And even if we were to limit this to the topic of sexuality, you do not have to go too far on Steam to find far more depraved games that Valve is fine with publishing. Hell, if we were to narrowly limit our criteria to the specific topic of uncensored half-equine hybrid penis, one of my favorite games of the year, <a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange/"><em><u>Baby Steps</u></em></a><em>,</em> clears <em>Horses</em> easily and can be bought on Steam and PSN.</p><p>What this underscores is the sheer danger of market consolidation in gaming. While companies like Valve and Epic do not legally have to carry a game, to not do so is functionally a death knell for that game on the PC; Santa Ragione has <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said</u></a> it threatens the studio’s continued existence. This is not equivalent to a theater chain declining to carry a movie; this is two (mostly one) American companies more or less deciding what content is commercially viable across most of the world, in ways that are somehow more vague and opaque than the MPAA. This is a hegemony of American prudishness, applied globally, incoherently, unevenly, and unseriously. Anybody responsible for these decisions would be vaporized in seconds by a Pinku movie from the 1970s, and if a single person in this chain of command has an arts degree they are pretending they don’t for the sake of an ill-defined idea of business. <em>Horses </em>cannot be the ceiling for what is artistically and commercially possible in games, because otherwise we are in deep horseshit.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Va5_rn3vG3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Krusty the clown - What the hell was that?"></iframe></figure><h2 id="broken-horses"><strong>Broken horses</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The scene where the woman tells you in no uncertain terms what the game is about. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite my minor issues with the game, I want to talk about a scene in <em>Horses</em> that I love. It is the scene that Santa Ragione speculated may have caused this controversy, the one with the “young girl” that changed during development. Despite its reputation, it is not actually a scene about sex, but rather one about money, deviancy, and power. As you guide the daughter of a businessman riding horsepersonback she makes explicit what is often implicit in life.</p><p>“I know what you're thinking. I know these aren't real horses. But...you know, the way they used to live...A lot of people find that unacceptable. I don't care, personally. But usually, people exhibiting immoral behavior also have dangerous ideas. Like my dad always says, each of us is a cog in the machine; we must all do our duty so society can function properly. So dangerous ideas are a concern for everyone. Because if the machine jams, everything falls apart. And we can't allow that to happen! The farmer... He does what he does. And my father...Well, my father makes sure that his business opportunities keep growing. It's simple: In this world, on this farm...everyone who lives their life recklessly and indulgently ends up exactly where they deserve. Do you know what I mean?”</p><p>I cannot claim to know the minds of the people who shot down <em>Horses</em>, but the vagueness and hypocritical nature of their responses point to an unspoken rule: Art that is deemed a liability to business must be avoided without question. Gaming is often many things, but its status as gambling and toys take higher precedent than its ambition as an art form. How these decisions are made is arbitrary and capricious with supposedly immutable guidelines that can, somehow, change in a heartbeat for the right game.&nbsp;</p><p>A private company pulling a game from distribution the day before it was set to be released is a punishment for being “reckless and indulgent”--not censorship, in their own telling, but a game maker ending up “where they deserve.” Banning <em>Horses </em>is an exercise in power, and to quote Pier Paolo Pasolini: “Power can essentially do what it wants, and what it wants is completely arbitrary, or dictated by economic needs that elude common logic.”</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-a-portable-4k-monitor-for-switch-2-but-with-a-catch</link>
            <guid>1373275</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="35655e5426fe6"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35655e5426fe6/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>While the Switch and Switch 2 are portable systems that come with their own built-in screens, I've often been drawn to pairing Nintendo's hybrid consoles with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch">portable monitors</a> when I'm on the road and away from my TV.</p>
<p>One of my favourite choices for the original Switch is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#the-premium-choice-espressodisplay-v2">Espresso V2</a>, a premium 1080p screen which doesn't even need the dock – you can connect the console via a USB-C cable and power the screen using another USB-C-based power brick.</p>
<p>You can imagine, then, how excited I was when Espresso Displays offered to send out the 4K version of their screen to test with the Switch 2. <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-pro?variant=47210169860328">The £650 Espresso Pro 15</a> boasts a 15.6-inch, 60Hz LCD panel capable of displaying 1.07 billion colours and weighs 800 grams. With its anodised aluminium casing and super-tough glass front, it's the kind of screen I can see myself taking on the road with me – but there's one big drawback.</p>

<p>It seems that Nintendo has changed the way the Switch 2 outputs video through its USB-C ports, so you need the dock to run it on external displays like this – and that means using Espresso's own HDMI-to-USB-C cable, <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/hdmi?variant=46000850272488">which comes at an extra cost of £60</a>.</p>
<p>Even then, there are issues. Espesso's aforementioned cable has an extra USB-A cable built in for additional power to turn on the screen, but this cable isn't physically long enough to reach the USB-C port on the Switch 2 dock.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to place the dock next to a wall socket so I could plug in a USB power brick to juice up the screen. Alas, even this isn't enough to bring the display to life, so <em>another</em> USB-C power supply was required, plugged directly into the Espresso Pro 15's second USB-C port.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Espresso V2 required a similar setup (both of its USB-C ports were occupied), but the need to use the dock and an extra power supply for the HDMI cable is somewhat inconvenient.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the fact that the Espresso Pro 15 isn't using an OLED panel is a disappointment, as the difference is definitely noticeable; while the LCD screen seen here is bright, it lacks the punch of other displays I've used, such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#when-1080p-just-doesnt-cut-it-innocn-pu15-pre-15-6-4k-oled-monitor">INNOCN PU15-PRE</a> (which is also 4K).</p>
<figure data-uuid="f56ae2becb514"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f56ae2becb514/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a shame, because the bundled <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-stand-plus?variant=46757226938600">Espresso Stand+</a> makes this even more appealing for gamers. Using powerful neodymium magnets, the screen bolts onto the stand with ease, and even allows you to spin the display 90 degrees for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tate-mode-nintendo-switch-games">TATE-mode shmup action</a>. The Stand+ is adjustable and comes with two height settings, making it quite versatile.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that I used the Espresso Pro 15 from a gamer's point of view. However, its maker describes it as a screen aimed at professionals, and it's certainly more successful when viewed from that perspective. It can be powered using a single USB-C cable, which also connects to your Mac or PC and turns it into a second display, complete with touch support. That's a far more elegant solution than having to use a dock and two power supplies, as is the case when playing on it with a Switch 2.</p>
<p>With its lofty price tag and dependence on an additional extra in the shape of a specialised HDMI cable, it's hard to recommend the Espresso Pro 15 if you're <em>solely</em> looking for a portable gaming screen to use with your Switch 2 – but if you in the market for one that can double as a work monitor <em>and</em> a gaming one, then it might be worth a look.</p>

			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLDUmptln8&amp;pp=2AYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase</a> dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the franchise, Creative Assembly announced that Total War: Medieval III is now in early development.</p>



<p>In the official announcement article, the developers position the game as a return to a grounded, systems-driven historical Total War, with a heavy focus on politics, religion, and feudal power structures, rather than just map-painting conquest and a focus on medieval Europe and its neighboring regions, rather than a globe-spanning map. </p>



<p>The game is being developed with the next-generation Warcore engine, an evolution of the Total War engine intended to power future titles and support both PC and consoles. The team confirmed plans to bring Total War experiences to PlayStation and Xbox using this technology, while emphasizing that high-end PC strategy remains the priority and that the series will stay at the forefront of large-scale battles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Total War: Medieval III was undoubtedly the showcase's highlight, there was plenty more, starting with the availability of the premium <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER III</a> DLC Tides of Torment, which adds three new Legendary Lords to the High Elves, Norsca, and Slaanesh races. Furthermore, the stream unveiled the upcoming Lords of The End Times Pack, which will unleash four new Legendary Lords into the colossal Immortal Empires campaign (which, by the way, is now available for free to <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-review-monsters-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER I</a> &amp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-ii-its-bloody-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER II</a> players) experience in Summer 2026. The first to be revealed is none other than the great necromancer, Nagash, who returns to reclaim his lost power and drown the world in undeath.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>These new lords also herald the arrival of the free End Times Update. Drawing inspiration from the lore, players will embark on a campaign experience transformed, featuring apocalyptic scenarios and cataclysmic events that push the boundaries of strategy and survival. And to crown this update, a new Legendary Lord will rise, ready to leave their mark on the cataclysm to come.</p>



<p>Today's announcements aren't everything. There's an unannounced Total War project that will be fully revealed at The Game Awards in a week from today. Creative Assembly described this as the next major release in one of the most ambitious games in Total War's entire history, framing it as the start of the franchise's exciting new era.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a> is in early pre-production, Creative Assembly have revealed during Total War's 25th anniversary showcase, with release still years away. It's to be the "rebirth of historical Total War", and CA are unveiling it earlier than they've ever announced a Total War game before, so that you crafty peasants can offer more feedback throughout development.</p>
<p>Time to hang up your Reikland Runefang and start boning up on the fall of the Byzantines - though there's precious little news about how the new Twar will differ in practice from Medieval 2, which launched way back in 2006. Here's a live action trailer full of moody-looking regents, some of whom are badly in need of a sticking plaster.

<p>
During the showcase stream, there was much loose historical background and talk of reinventing the wheel (which may have happened several times during the medieval era - enlighten me, historians?) but few concrete specifics. They don't even have a fixed start date for the period, though it sounds like it'll be approximately 12th to 15th century.</p><p>If I'm reading the entrails correctly, the game's world will range from the Holy Roman Empire through the Kingdom of England to the Italian Free States, the Mongols and the Ottomans. It will feature such celebs as Saladin, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and Richard the Lionheart.
</p>
<p>
The devs characterised the medieval period as one of experimentation, personal ambition, and the formation of nations. There was an aside on "lines of succession", which suggests you might be switching between rulers and their heirs, but colour that speculation. There was also a bit of detail on recruitment and historical armies, with a senior game designer commenting that rather than having a standing army, you might call on oaths of fealty to rally the banners of your vassals. 
</p>
<p>As divulged on <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii">the official website</a>, Medieval 3 will run on Warcore, Creative Assembly's new engine tech. It's billed as "unlike anything we’ve worked with before, offering a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks - all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve." Given how long Creative Assembly have been working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a>, it's nice to hear that there's a more comprehensive technological overhaul in the offing. </p>
<p>
I'll be honest, Medieval is one of the Twars I skipped. I am Shogun and Three Kingdoms to the bone. Still, I'm delighted for you fans of knights and castles. If you're baying for more, please direct your baying at <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii">this announcement post</a> from Medieval 3 creative director Leif Walter. It contains a lot of blue sky thinking, but there are some possibly indicative remarks about letting players deviate from the textbooks and your realm being "really almost like the main character in an RPG game".
</p><p>
That's not all Creative Assembly announced in their showcase. Not all they teased, rather. They've got another game reveal next week, during the Geoff Awards. Apparently, "this title will be Total War's next major release and represents one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history, marking the beginning of an exciting new era." Are the words "for the Emperor" stomping with zealous indignation towards this sentence, CA?
</p>
<p>
If all of this has you classique Warhammer advocates boarding your griffins and fleeing to the mountains, come back. There's more Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC on the way - Lords of the End Times, which introduces uber-necromancer Nagash and three other legendary lords. We'll try to write about that when we can. I have to go read up on Eleanor of Aquitaine.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 goes live on Tuesday, meaning that there’s a large update for all players to download in order to get back in the game.</p>



<p>While many have been able to download the large update with no issue, there have been many others reporting issues with getting the latest content.</p>



<p>First mentioned by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1996629708621148440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, users are reporting that they are stuck in an “update available” loop. It’s not all platforms, but one that’s known to have an issue is Battle.net</p>



<p><strong>“The game is updated, but I can’t get in [because] this is the [message] I keep getting, Battlenet,”</strong> one user <a href="https://x.com/NightwolfLotus/status/1996629997608665298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Said another</a>, “<strong>Already downloaded the update yet I cannot get passed this [Black Ops 7 start screen. I’ve restarted [Battle.net] and nothing.”</strong><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272"></a></p>



<p>As of writing, Activision nor developers Treyarch and Raven Software have made any sort of public comment on the issue. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>



<p>Have you had any issues playing Black Ops 7 after downloading the Season 1 update?

Descending to the very core of the Pirate stronghold, Samus exterminated the energy-based parasites called Metroids, and defeated Mother Brain, the leader of the Pirate horde. But the' Space Pirates were far from finished. Several Pirate research vessels were orbiting Zebes while Samus fought on the surface below. After the fall of Mother Brain, the ships escaped, with the hopes of finding enough resources to rebuild their forces, and take their revenge. After discovering a possible Pirate colony on planet Tallon IV, Samus has again prepared for war, hoping to end the Pirate threat forever.”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Hale being the most famous voice of Samus, you’d perhaps assume she also recorded these introductory lines to the world of Prime. Well, you’d be wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's Vanessa. Vanessa Marshall," Hale reveals. It's perhaps not a surprise, as Marshall is already credited with also lending her talents to the voice of Samus in Metroid Prime, notably contributing her death scream to the sound library. Marshall also starred alongside Hale in Marvel’s Midnight Suns, as well as Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty as Olga, and may be familiar to fans of animated TV as the voice of Hera Syndulla in Star Wars' Rebels and Bad Batch series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to why Retro Studios and Nintendo went with Marshall over Hale for this prospective monologue, only to then ditch it anyway, Hale says she's unsure. “I adore Vanessa,” Hale adds. “I love that we actually shared this role. It's so crazy, and I'm not sure why. I never remember saying no to this. I would never have said no to doing this. They may have preferred her work. I have no idea.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not getting to record these fully formed sentences, Hale did get the lion's share of the grunt work on Metroid Prime. It sounds an intriguing process, which she went on to explain in more detail:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I like to have identified a character's way of speaking before I do grunting for them, because how you grunt is different to how I grunt, to how anyone else grunts," Hale explained. "It's very specific. If you are a civilian and you're grunting, you're like... [makes surprised grunt noise] because it's all surprising and it's all new. If you've done it a million times, you're like [makes short grunt noise], because you've gone under fire 1,800 times and you're used to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that once-lost intro narration was never used in the original Metroid Prime, parts of the monologue would later see the light of day, thanks to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Jay Ward, who voiced Star Fox’s Wolf O’Donnell in the Nintendo fighting game series, rerecorded certain lines of it that were laid under the Opening/Menu - Metroid Prime track on the soundtrack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Who knows where this monologue will turn up next, or why it was never actually used in the final game. At least for now, thanks to Samus herself, part of this mystery has been solved. Would you have liked the intro narration to have been kept? Although I do love the lonely, wordless nature of Metroid Prime, I do like the “Ripley at the end of Alien” feel this gives to the game.

            <p>Three Fields Entertainment, developers of Burnout with sky roads racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckreation">Wreckreation</a>, have announced that their entire team have been put on notice of redundancy. According to the announcement from CEO and former Criterion studio director Fiona Sperry, this comes as Three Fields find themselves without backing from Wreckreation publishers THQNordic, having "had to self-fund most of this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful," Sperry wrote in a message shared via the game's Twitter account.</p>
<p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for all of us," she continued. "What makes it even harder is that we have so many things in the pipeline — multiple features, updates, and creative ideas that we were excited to bring to the game, many of which are showcased in the video we’re sharing today."</p>
<p>Said video, which you can watch via the tweet above, shows off a number of feature additions which I'll be keen to give a go if they do make it into Wreckreation. One's an "accident black spots" mode mirroring classic Burnout's brilliant crash mode, in which you're given a junction and tasked with causing as costly a pileup as possible. There's also a "tightrope mode" all about driving along very narrow airborne obstacle courses, the ability to add buildings to the map while in the game's live mix building mode, and a bunch of construction vehicles and trucks you can drive around.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy.</p><p>Since the launch of *Wreckreation*, our small… <a href="https://t.co/4lq7irQrNF">pic.twitter.com/4lq7irQrNF</a></p></div>— Wreckreation Game (@ArcadeDriving) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadeDriving/status/1996584475682115871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Of all those, the crash mode's something I could genuinely see giving Wreckreation some bounce-back potential, assuming the likes of BeamNG.Drive haven't filled that void in many players' minds. The ability to essentially build your own towns could also go a long way to helping put a plaster on one of the game's biggest problems - its boringly barren worldspace outside of player-built sky spaghetti.</p>
<p>"My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," Sperry wrote. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team." As of writing, Three Fields still plan to deliver an update adding crossplay to Wreckreation before Christmas.</p>
<p>All the news we report about game developers losing their jobs or being at risk of that sees us send our best to the folks affected, but I'm particularly sad to see Three Fields in this tough situation. That's largely because I really enjoyed the work Sperry, Alex Ward and co did on Burnout and Need For Speed while at Criterion, with both those series either dormant or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">currently on hold</a>.</p>
<p>Both Wreckreation and 2019's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dangerous-driving">Dangerous Driving</a> had a chance to be Three Fields' big 'Burnout's back, baby' moments, conclusively proving to the suits at EA that locking the series in the attic of dormant entities was a hugely short-sighted move. Neither quite managed to stick the landing, though. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckreation-melds-burnouts-anarchy-with-gta-onlines-airborne-marble-runs-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-polish">my hours playing both</a>, I've never felt like that faliure was down to them being cynical nostalgia-fests, attempts to cash in on the anarchic old arcade racers myself and others fell in love with. Instead, and perhaps this is because I've gone in each time hoping I'll be blown away, the two games felt like the vision was solid, but the small studio just hadn't been able to nail the nuances of execution.</p><p>They weren't a million miles off reigniting the magic of classic Burnout, with EA and Criterion's substantial resources behind it. They're still yet to get there, though. Here's hoping that another publisher who're willing to back Three Fields swoop in and as always, solidarity to the studio's staff as they face an uncertain future.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today. The Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 game was already getting dinged in some people’s minds over a trailer that showcased overly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368"><span>chatty companion characters</span></a><span>. Now we’ve moved on from side-eyeing MCU-era cringe to debates about whether or not the game even looks good. A lot of folks are throwing tomatoes at the supposedly lifeless open-world segments on social media, but people who are actually playing </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>tell a different story.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, some </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>screenshots are pretty rough. The game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-amiibo-samus-music-motorcycle-functionality-2000650508"><span>desert sections</span></a><span> can look pretty bland in still shots, and without any real dynamic weather effects or notable architecture and landmarks, they look like something out of a game from almost 20 years ago. The comparisons to older games that it resembles, or even older games that are doing a lot more with their environments, are not flattering.</span></p>

There are plenty of ugly areas in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, but there are also ones that look pretty lovely. </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, though? That shit looks like an ugly GameCube game that was still in early development, no matter where you are. So when another big Nintendo game seems to be following the same open-world style at the expense of detailed environments, it’s understandable why some folks would be worried.</span></p>

 <p><span>In general, </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has some notable graphic disparities depending on the environment you’re in. Folks have been noting this before the game was even out by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1nf7yrd/i_cant_wrap_my_head_around_how_theres_such_a_big/"><span>comparing shots from the same trailer</span></a><span>, in which the game oscillated between looking pretty alright to looking like the shots people are complaining about.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, some of this feels like knee-jerk reactions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>’s series-low reviews. The game is sitting at </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/"><span>a respectable 81 on review aggregate site Metacritic</span></a><span>, but that is a bit of a drop compared to the 90+ scores of the first three games. I saw folks on a ResetEra forum saying this was “an absolute failure” or a “fucking disaster” for the historically beloved series, so some of this drive-by hate feels a bit reactionary to a game some people have already decided is a flop.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But what are people who have actually played the game saying? I was surprised to see some folks on my feed also call it one of the best-looking games Nintendo had brought to its handheld console. However, most of the praise points specifically to the smaller-scale dungeon areas, rather than the open-world ones, even comparing its mood and visual identity to the </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>games, which makes sense considering staff who used to work on the series at 343 Industries have </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1996542214466687263"><span>moved over to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>developer Retro</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retro’s art design still rocks! Metroid Prime 4 is a visual stunner — and no framerate drops in sight. (Playing at 60fps right now — prefer visual clarity over 120fps, though it’s mighty nice on my LG M5, too) <a href="https://t.co/X1ZswwPfAV">pic.twitter.com/X1ZswwPfAV</a></p> <p>— Peer Schneider (@PeerIGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeerIGN/status/1996471091238498810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“…</span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> is a technical marvel,” Vincent Acovino wrote over at </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/02/nx-s1-5627515/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review"><i><span>NPR</span></i></a><span>. “[…] Colors pop, light dances off surfaces, particles drift, and choir vocals layer on top of ambient soundscapes. What Nintendo has done here is a model that the rest of the industry needs to take note of. Great art and music should take priority over unnecessarily taxing graphical ‘innovations.’”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Within each dungeon-like area to explore, Metroid Prime 4 shines, mixing tactile FPS exploration with gorgeous visuals and impeccable atmosphere,” Oscar Taylor-Kent said in the </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span> review.</span></p> <p><span>Now that players have </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> in their hands, some are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pdrahj/stunned_how_good_prime_4_looks_within_first_hour/"><span>praising the visuals</span></a><span>, especially in those smaller, more focused spaces.</span></p> <p><span>“Retro is a master of using mostly baked plus some tasteful dynamic lighting to achieve great visuals,” Reddit user threeinacorner wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“You really need to see it on a highly capable OLED TV with really good HDR. I have the G3 and HDR on this game is GREAT,” SouthernGuy776 wrote in the same thread.</span></p> <p><span>Overall, it sounds like the desert sections are </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>’s biggest eyesore, and that the bespoke areas Samus explores are much nicer to look at. That probably won’t stop the internet from taking a bad picture and running with it, though.&nbsp;</span></p>
