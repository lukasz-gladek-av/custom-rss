<p>Several builds of unreleased games have been uploaded to an undisclosed datamining discord server, including Riot Games’ 2XKO.</p>



<p>So far, Insider Gaming has been able to verify that early builds of the following games have been uploaded to the server:</p>



<ul>
<li>Killing Floor 3 </li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>‘ 2XKO</li>



<li>PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</li>



<li>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders </li>



<li>An early build of Delta Force Hawk Ops</li>
</ul>



<p>According to one source that’s in the server, uploads of the games builds are primarily used for datamining purposes, but some games with less protection will likely get leaked online. Either way, it looks like all of these games will have new bits of information leaked about them in the near future.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on where all of the builds originated, but according to other sources, 2XKO, PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, and ARC Raiders have all recently been in a wider pool of playtesting.</p>



<p>Should any of the games leak, we will keep you updated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/634123/balatro-localthunk-developer-anonymous-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Balatro</em> just won four Game Developers Choice Awards, including Game of the Year, but the person who made the game wasn’t on stage to accept them.</p><p>Instead, Playstack communications director Wout van Haldren spoke on behalf of <em>Balatro’s</em> developer, who goes by the alias LocalThunk, each time the game won an award. “The team does that to give LocalThunk the freedom to work in the style that he likes, which we respect,” Playstack marketing director Liz Cheng-Moore tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That’s our job,” van Haldren adds. </p><p>It’s an arrangement that the Playstack team figured out with LocalThunk ahead of other ceremonies like The Game Awards, where <em>Balatro</em> won three awards and was nominated for Game of the Year. LocalThunk didn’t want to be public, but he also didn’t want to be disrespectful to fans and the industry, so now the Playstack team accepts his awards on his behalf.</p><p><em>Balatro</em> was one of the biggest hits of 2024, launching after a series of popular demos to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">wide acclaim</a>. Months after its initial launch, the game launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">on iOS and Android</a>, and as of January, it’s sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348727/balatro-5-million-copies-the-game-awards">more than 5 million copies</a>. </p><p>LocalThunk was at the Game Developers Conference this week meeting with other developers, but van Haldren and Cheng-Moore think he’ll generally remain anonymous to the public. It’s not that he wants to be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/balatros-localthunk-isnt-trying-to-pull-a-banksy-he-just-wanted-to-be-left-alone-to-make-his-game/">the next Banksy,</a> Cheng-Moore says. He just prefers not to be in the spotlight.</p><p>His mysteriousness extends to how he communicates with the team and makes games. For example, Cheng-Moore tells me that <a href="https://localthunk.com/">his recent blog</a> was something that he talked about one day and launched the next. “It’s fully done by him,” Cheng-Moore says.</p><p>And with <em>Balatro</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">upcoming gameplay update</a>, which is set to launch sometime this year, “I think he’s just going to surprise us one day and he’s going to say, ‘hey, here’s the 1.1 build,’”van Haldren says. “I think he works best with that freedom, because that’s how he made <em>Balatro</em> in the first place. He had no timelines, no stress. He could just tinker, and that’s how the magic happened.”</p><p>van Haldren adds that “I have not seen a single thing so far that he’s working on. And I kind of like it because I’ll be surprised as well.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) - the same organisation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">used to run E3 before it was cancelled</a> - has announced the Accessible Games Initiative, a cross-industry campaign to provide consumers with clear information about the accessibility features available in video games.</p>
<p>The five founding companies - EA, Google, Microsoft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>, and Ubisoft - have partnered with the ESA to "help provide clear information about whether a specific video game has accessibility features and, if so, what those features are". Amazon Games, Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> have also since pledged support.</p>

<p>The initiative is launching with a set of 24 tags - such as clear text, large and clear subtitles, narrated menus, stick inversion and save anytime - with "clear criteria about what each tag means", and "over time", the initiative expects participating companies to place the Accessible Games Initiative tags on digital storefronts, product pages or digital catalogues. The tags have reportedly been developed with guidance and feedback from disabled gamers, advocacy groups, and developers, "all of whom provided valuable insights about the real-world applications of the tags".</p>
<p>"The timeline for implementation of the tags will be determined on a company-by-company basis and is always voluntary," the ESA added, and as feedback is gathered from the community and new technologies and features are developed, it "expect[s] the existing tags to evolve and to introduce additional tags in the future".</p>
<p>"Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games," said Stanley Pierre-Louis, ESA president and CEO.</p>
<p>"We are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders. This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play."</p>
<p>To view the tags and learn more about the Accessible Games Initiative, visit <a href="http://accessiblegames.com/">accessiblegames.com</a>.</p>
<p>In December, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rnib-introduces-toolkit-and-player-panel-to-help-devs-make-games-more-accessible-to-players-with-sight-loss">Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) established a player testing panel for the video games industry</a>, research institutions, and academia called the Design for Every Gamer Player Panel.</p>
<p>Alongside its new Devkit: Best Practice in Accessible Gaming 2024, the organisation said that by engaging with this diverse group, "developers and researchers can gather essential feedback on accessibility, helping to ensure that their games and studies are inclusive and accessible to gamers with sight loss".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a limited-time event in Escape from Tarkov, setting bosses to a 100% spawn rate for a single day. One of the biggest talking points coming out of this spontaneous change is that PvE players have once again missed out on the event, for reasons unknown.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov stressed that as a wipe progresses in Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">around 50% of players</a> are locked in on the PvE platform. It comes as a surprise to learn that all those players are missing out on this latest Tarkov event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pushed-aside">Pushed Aside</h2>



<p>The newest <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1903734472383590723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Escape from Tarkov event</a> is a simple thing that allows boss characters to spawn on their respective maps with a rate of 100%. Every raid you enter is guaranteed to have a boss in it – unless you’re too late to reach them, of course.</p>



<p>However, fans are up in arms on social platforms because once again, Battlestate Games has neglected to loop in the PvE-based players for this event. This is far from being the first time this has happened, but this time around, it makes <strong>no sense</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, PvE players miss out on pre-wipe events <strong>because their games won’t automatically reset</strong>, but this is a limited-time, one-off event that’s disconnected from any major update.</p>



<p>Fans are yet to determine <strong>why </strong>this Escape from Tarkov event has been pushed live, as it’s out of the blue and serves no purpose other than giving players a tighter challenge and helping them out with some ‘boss kill’ tasks.</p>



<p>Are you one of the many people playing PvE in Escape from Tarkov? Are you annoyed at missing this event? Let me know in the comments how you feel about it all.</p>

<p>Uploaded to a channel called Digital Preservation, the game - seemingly an in-development prototype with placeholder voice work and some wonky visuals - runs for four hours and boasts some, if not quite all, of the cast we see in the PS4 version and includes sound effects, score, and many of the plot beats and environments we know from the final PS4 (and remake) version (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/watch-a-full-playthrough-of-the-first-person-until-dawn-that-never-released">PushSquare</a>).</p>

<p>Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a new report now claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Australian classification board is notoriously strict - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-banned-in-austrailia-for-implied-sexual-violence">fighting game Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact was banned back in December</a>; in a later statement, this was revealed to be due to implied sexual violence involving minors - and this isn't even the first Silent Hill game to be banned, as Homecoming's eye-watering "high impact" torture scene similarly saw it refused classification in 2008, too. A censored version was later released.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-park-the-stick-of-truth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/saints-row-4">Saints Row 4</a> are among dozens of games to have been denied an Australian release, with many thought to have been banned due to sexual violence, drug use, or "sexual activity involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18".</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-vibrant-visuals-coming-to-minecraft-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, Mojang revealed the Vibrant Visuals update for Minecraft. It’s an evolution of the game’s 15-year-old visual palette, and it’s set to change how reflections, sunlight, water, draw distances, and more all behave in Minecraft. It’s set to alter the game’s overall appearance without changing too much, but when is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft?</p>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update is already exciting fans worldwide. It’s one of the most major updates to hit Minecraft for a while, and it’ll be added alongside various changes – such as the introduction of a <strong>happy ghast</strong>. Amazing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn when Vibrant Visuals is coming to Minecraft.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-vibrant-visuals-release-date-status">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Release Date Status</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, the release date for Vibrant Visuals in Minecraft was pending, with Mojang having mentioned that it’s coming ‘in the future’.</strong> However, players on select Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices using a beta or preview system will be able to test Vibrant Visuals sooner than that.</p>



<p>Minecraft Live 2025 had some solid reveals, but the Vibrant Visuals announcement was by far the best received. It’ll follow the Minecraft Spring to Life update, which is set to drop soon. Later this year, players will also get their first look at the dried ghast, which can be claimed and turned into a ghastling, and then into a <strong>happy ghast</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vibrant-visuals">What is Vibrant Visuals?</h2>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update was perfectly broken down in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minecraft Live recap</a>, but I’ll paste the most important details about the update here.</p>



<p>Vibrant Visuals will change and introduce various key features in Minecraft:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadows interacting with sunlight more accurately</li>



<li>Volumetric fog</li>



<li>Directional lighting upgrades</li>



<li>Infinite clouds across the draw</li>



<li>‘Thousands of individually crafted elements’</li>



<li>Accurate light rays through trees, windows, water, etc</li>



<li>Glow upgrades and evolved reflections</li>



<li>More accurate water visuals</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Mojang was quick to point out that the Vibrant Visuals update in Minecraft won’t destroy the ‘creative principles’ of the game – it’s almost entirely a visual update.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to know, ‘When is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft,’ you’ve got a little longer to wait, I’m afraid. It won’t be long, though – Mojang has announced it will be speeding up these ‘Game Drops’ in future, so you’ll know more very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-ii-sweep-city-central-four-teams/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League Major II tournament in Texas is unfolding as we speak, and it has been one of the fastest-paced events we’ve seen in years. Out of every match played, only <strong>four fixtures </strong>have gone beyond a 3-0 scoreline as the most dominant teams in the business steamroll the competition.</p>



<p>Only four teams are left in the running – Surge, FaZe, Ultra, and LAT. Fans are expecting a repeat of Major I with an LAT v. FaZe grand final, but Toronto Ultra is in the midst of a phenomenal lower-bracket run that could subvert those expectations. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-everything">Take Everything</h2>



<p>Toronto Ultra was thrown into the lower bracket by Cloud9 at the earliest opportunity before kickstarting an epic run that has seen the squad eliminate three teams back to back. In those three series, not a single map was given up by Toronto Ultra, the squad that hosted Major I and that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">will host COD Champs in June</a>.</p>



<p>LAT is in a similar spot, having eliminated Heretics, Royal Ravens, and Cloud9 after being forced into the loser’s bracket by Boston Breach in a shock loss early in the tournament. </p>



<p>Recently, LAT won the CDL Minor II event – the team is now looking to make it big in Major II to redeem a close loss against Atlanta FaZe in Madrid in February.</p>



<p>In an interview after the win against Cloud9, LAT’s Scrappy said about that series and this one:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel like we’re a complete team, I feel like at Major I our SnD wasn’t great, our map pool wasn’t great, but I think coming into this Major we put a lot of grind into it and we’re looking good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other dark horse in the bracket is Vancouver Surge. The squad has been on point since picking up Neptune, and the upper bracket has been their’s to control, with the team already decimating the Royal Ravens and Boston Breach. They’ll need to push past FaZe to get into the GF, but that might be light work for the Surge.</p>



<p>At Minor II, Surge eliminated Atlanta FaZe, and before that, the team scored a 3-1 win over the tournament favourites in the Major II qualifiers. FaZe hasn’t beaten Surge since June 2024, but they haven’t had many opportunities until recently. </p>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now, and I can easily see any of the four teams left taking everything, but I love an underdog story, so I’d hope that Surge has a fair crack at picking up the trophy.</p>

There's no better news than "game that hasn't had an update in years just received one", and this week that applies to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. Despite first releasing eight years ago - almost to the day, its eighth anniversary is in a couple of days time on March 24th - and not receiving a new update in two years, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/overhype-studios">Overhype Studios</a> has come back to the game not just with some fixes, but with some new content too.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First, the new stuff. There's a couple of new legendary locations that you can explore now, the first one being a place called Abandoned Village. A simple name, but this one is apparently good for mid-game mercenary companies, and can apparently be found by "simply exploring the world." Overhype is keeping quiet about the second one, noting that it's "more difficult" and that you'll only find it after conquering the first one. Both will net you the opportunity to round up some new loot and legendary items too.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you'll need to start a completely new campaign in order to access the new content, which might be a bit of an extra pain for those of you that are prone to modding the game. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/365360/announcements/detail/536596558933657570">announcement post</a> for the update explicitly notes that "most mods will not work anymore until they've been updated by their authors". Steam typically automatically updates your games in the background, so you'll either have to disable your mods and wait until they're compatible with the new update, or revert to the previous version of the game (Overhype's update post has details on how you can do that).
</p>
<p>
In terms of fixes, there's a whole bunch that have been implemented that were "accumulated over the last year", from simple ones to typos, to rare bugs like one would occur when killing a Lindwurm via its tail with a poison-coated weapon. You can read the update post for the full list.
</p>
<p>
Probably also worth noting that the game is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/365360/Battle_Brothers/">70% off on Steam right now</a>, so not a bad time to jump in.

            <p>
Everybody loves a good fairytale, but I'm sure you can agree that some kind of twist on a Brothers Grimm story is a bit overdone by now, so how about a game based on folklore from Normandy? Carimara: Beneath the forlorn limbs is exactly that, a self described "short and creepy fairytale" that has a look about it where I can easily imagine walking around its world and think "cripes, it smells a bit around here, 'ey?"
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The gameplay concept is an odd one too: you are the titular Carimara, and your whole goal is to exorcise a ghost by answering questions using cards. How do you get cards? By finding different objects, people, and seemingly concepts around this messed up looking world. It could be something as simple as an acorn, or a creepy old lady, there's lots of things you can find, but judging from the trailer the people you encounter might not care about them all.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I MADE A NEW GAME !!!<br>Carimara is a Short and Creepy Fairytale 🧙‍♂️💀✨</p><p>Wishlists, reposts, likes, and comments are highly appreciated 😁</p><p>Out on may 22th, steam page below ⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/B8Lcn6ucXG">pic.twitter.com/B8Lcn6ucXG</a></p></div>— Bastinus Rex (@BastinusRex) <a href="https://twitter.com/BastinusRex/status/1903081759018738010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Carimara's Steam page is appropriately light on details, adding to its overall mysterious vibe, but it looks to me like you'll have to see out the right cards to get certain responses - though no doubt this won't be an easy task given that it all looks like everyone is a mean creep.
</p>
<p>
I'm very much into how Carimara is looking, according to developer Bastinus Rex "almost all textures and sounds are hand made and come from photos or record from the French countryside" which feels like a really nice touch. It has a lot of texture to it, really reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felvidek">Felvidek</a> in some ways too. Plus it has a nice and short 30 to 60 minute run time, so I'm looking forward to this one dropping this coming May 22 - you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3570370/CARIMARA_Beneath_the_forlorn_limbs/">here</a>.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> is the best-selling game of all time, but it's looked pretty much the same for the entirety of its almost 14 year run. There's an argument to be made that it's showing its age in places, an argument I won't make because I don't think so myself, but all the same, as revealed during today's Minecraft Live, Mojang announced that the sandbox game is getting a pretty big visual overhaul update called Vibrant Visuals. Now, don't worry, it'll still be all blocks and squares 'n' that, but it will be changing up how lighting looks.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals">blog post</a> explains things in a bit more detail, with one of the big things being that there'll now be volumetric lighting. What that translates to is things like sunlight shining more naturally across different surfaces, even shining through windows, and every individual block will cast its own shadow. Mobs and items will glow a bit more too, so it's not just about the overworld lighting.
</p>
<p>
This update is coming to the Bedrock Edition of the game first, with the post noting that it hopes to bring this "graphics revamp (either fully or partially) to as many devices as possible", though there's not even a release window for it yet. There are plans to bring it to Java Edition too.
</p>
<p>
I might not have much of a horse in this race as someone that only really plays Minecraft once in a blue moon (and normally swiftly puts it down because I'm not that kind of creative and I get too stressed out from survival mode), but honestly, I'm not a fan. Minecraft is inherently not a natural looking game, and this lighting overhaul just adds a touch to much realism for my tastes. Besides, this kind of lighting already exists in countless mods, so for plenty of people it's not even really needed.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there were a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap">few other announcements</a> from Minecraft Live too, like the fact you'll soon be able to fly around on friendly versions of ghasts, which I do quite like the look of. There's a live event taking place from March 25 to April 7 too where you get to hang out with Jack Black's version of Steve to defend a village in some mini-games, which'll net you a cape if you're successful. Bit less exciting, but to each their own!

			<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft proudly <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows has already reached two million players, surpassing the launch of Origins and Odyssey. On release day, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had broken</a> the milestone of one million copies sold.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a strong start, which the publisher absolutely needed after all the financial disappointments of the last couple of years, between Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. As you already know if you're an avid Wccftech reader, there are strong rumors that the Guillemot brothers, who own the biggest stake in the company, are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly seeking investors to create a new entity that would control Ubisoft's largest franchises</a>, starting with Assassin's Creed. A healthy debut for Shadows will most likely help in that regard.</p>
<p>Still, it's too early to tell how successful the game will really end up being. The split between platforms will also be interesting to analyze. The game marks <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's return to big day-one releases on Valve's Steam</a>, the largest PC platform. So far, the concurrent player peak is fairly low (60K), but PC gamers have been used to having to buy the publisher's titles via Ubisoft Connect or the Epic Games Store. It's hard to infer much from this relatively low figure; the PC platform could still make up a sizable portion of that two million user base.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo rated the game 8.7, largely praising Ubisoft Quebec's efforts and the publisher's decision to delay the game:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> celebrated its 15th anniversary last year, but despite growing into those troublesome teenage years, it appears that developer Mojang has no plans to replace it with a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a recent trip to the Stockholm studio, IGN asked about the possibility of the best-selling game of all time getting a sequel. Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla, had an amusing, yet to-the-point answer for us: “Do you think we're going to have an Earth 2? No, no, there's no Minecraft 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Minecraft 2.0 is evidently not on the horizon, that doesn’t mean the survival-crafting phenomenon won’t continue to evolve. In fact, plans stretch way into the future, with a goal of at least doubling its current lifespan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've existed for 15 years”, stated Garneij. “We want to exist at least 15 years more so we actually, Agnes [Larsson, Minecraft Vanilla’s game director] and I, we work as a team. We set the vision and strategy for our game for what can we do beyond that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an ambition propelled by Mojang’s desire to innovate, continuing the mine and craft, so to speak, new ideas upon their rock-solid foundations. Those foundations are beginning to show their age, though, Garneij admitted, and while there are no plans for an engine overhaul, it does mean that new content, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">the newly revealed Vibrant Visuals graphics update</a>, does take time to put into practice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the age of the game is a challenge," Garneij said. "It's a 15-year-old platform, 15-year-old technology that slows us down in one sense. So other new games have new engines, and they can run really fast. So I would say the technology and our age [are our biggest challenges].”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, Minecraft continues to be one of the most popular games in the world, and, as far as we can tell, shows no signs of slowing down. There's also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world">no plan for Minecraft to go free-to-play</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-wont-use-ai-minecraft-is-about-creativity-and-creating">take advantage of generative AI technology</a>.

That's a purpose, [it] makes life look beautiful. So for us, we really want it to be our teams that make our games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla, expanded on this sentiment: “For me, it's the thinking outside of the box part. This specific touch of: what is Minecraft? How does it look? That extra quality is really tricky to create through AI. We even try to have remote teams sometimes and guide them in building things for us, which has never worked, because you have to be here working together face-to-face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean creativity is... you need to meet like this as a person, as a human to really truly understand the values and principles and the ecosystem, the lore, everything. It's so massive Minecraft, it's a planet, it's massive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The humans making Minecraft continue to build on its record-breaking foundations. The newly revealed graphics update, titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">Vibrant Visuals, is due out in the near future</a>, and Mojang <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world">continues to refuse to make Minecraft free-to-play</a>.

During a recent interview with IGN, developer Mojang said it's determined to stick with the established "buy and own the game" approach, even now, 16 years after it came out. In short: don't expect Minecraft to go free-to-play any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, it doesn't really work with the way we built it," explained Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn't work in that way for us. It's a purchase of the game and then that's it. For us it's important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that's a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It's the best deal in the world.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the industry has evolved over the years, many games have made the jump to free-to-download but infested with battle pass and cosmetic pack waters, with mixed results. Examples include Overwatch 2’s decision to go free-to-play, Destiny 2, or Minecraft’s Microsoft stablemate Halo Infinite (at least when it comes to its multiplayer).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure is of course on video game publishers and developers to find new ways to monetize to survive, but this is seemingly a pressure not felt by Garneij and her Mojang teammates: “No, no. What's important for us is that many people can enjoy it still and that's going on strong still.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment expanded upon by Minecraft Vanilla’s game director, Agnes Larsson: ”I mean for me, it’s part of the important values of Minecraft. I think it's become such an important thing of what Minecraft is and the perfect culture and values, and I think we all here can agree on that. It's a thing for the game and it's one part of what makes the game strong. It has strong values.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Comparison Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft will continue to evolve without asking its players to spend money for new features, then. This is exemplified by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">the upcoming Vibrant Visuals graphics overhaul</a>, which arrives free of charge in the coming months.

            <p>
Keita Takahashi is probably one of the most recognizable names in games, in no small part thanks to a game that needs no introduction, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>. That game was made at Namco, before it became the Bandai Namco we know today, and Takahashi actually left the studio back in 2006 around the time they merged, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/20/150569.html">GameSpark</a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/katamari-damacy-creator-keita-takahashi-talks-about-his-decision-to-leave-bandai-namco-and-the-inspiration-behind-his-new-game/">Automaton</a>), the developer has shared the reason behind his departure.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"I left the company because I didn’t want to be limited to only working with the people there," Takahashi quite plainly put it. "I wondered why I was only making games with Japanese people. I thought if I could develop games with more people from other countries, I would be able to get ideas from different perspectives. I’m currently developing games with a range of people from all over the world."
</p>
<p>
Takahashi is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> at his studio Uvula, a quite lovely looking game that looks to explore disability and the small difficulties that come in daily life in his usual, quirky way. Despite working with a more global team these days, he did admit that he doesn't know "what school culture is like in the US, so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements" in to a T. 
</p>
<p>
He still thinks that there'll be something for everyone in the game though, as the main character doesn't want to go to school because they're being bullied, and Takahashi thinks that "this is something that happens worldwide, not just in Japan. I was actually bullied myself, and never felt like going to school."
</p>
<p>
I enjoy Takahashi's work a lot, Katamari is a game I'd recommend to probably anyone, and Wattam was a delight too, weirdness and all. Whether I'm the target audience or not doesn't seem to matter much to Takahashi either as he said: "I make games that I feel satisfied with, so I’d like people to play them if they want to. I guess I probably should make games while thinking about the target audience, but I’ll work on that in my next life." Quite happy that he's making the games he is in this one myself.
</p>
<p>
To a T is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">due out May 28th</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stay-forever-home-hands-on-pushing-the-boundaries-of-pet-simulation-in-vr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’d be the first to admit that my time with VR and AR is fairly limited, but at this years GDC in San Francisco, it was impossible not to be drawn in by the awesome tech and games that developers are working on in the space. In fact, one of my biggest takeaways from GDC is that I’ve walked away eager to try out virtual reality again after briefly giving it a go a few years back.</p>



<p>One game that stuck out as particularly impressive to me was Stay: Forever Home, a soon-to-be-released XR game that pushes the boundaries of VR and AR technology to create a fully immersive pet simulator. Its developers, Windup Minds, are a small fully-remote team consisting of veteran developers behind the likes of Meta’s Bogo and First Steps.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home evolves around your pet named Ember, a magical canine that lives by your side and is fully responsive to your actions to how you also interact with the world. Ember is powered by unscripted AI-powered behaviour that creates a familiar feeling that everyone with a real-life dog knows. From mischievous antics to being needy because she wants to be petted, it creates a genuine feeling of immersion that no pet simulator on the market has been able to pull off. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developers say that the game designs to “love you back” and during my 25-30 minute demo, I got to see exactly what they meant first-hand. Despite being initially weirded out by feeling somewhat unnatural wearing a VR headset and watched by the developers (again, I’m not super into VR), it didn’t take long to realise that the developers were onto something special.</p>



<p>To start, I was introduced to Ember who appeared in a floating portal in her own world and at first she was a little nervous and skittish of who I was – just like how a real-world pet would be. To gain her trust, I was instructed to feed her a few berries, where she progressively became more trusting of me and soon, she trusted me enough to jump from her world into mine. From here, the game was designed for me to get familiar with the controls and what you can do with Ember, from petting and brushing her down to making her fetch a ball. It was all very reminiscent of being at home with my own dogs, where I could sit down and pet her for as long as I wanted at my own leisure and mess with her floppy ears as I would do with my Labrador (sorry Max). </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stay: Forever Home VR Game Showcase | Coming April '25 #VirtualPet #PetSimulation #VirtualRealityPet" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6RDGCAQOdk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Moving on from the mixed-reality environment, I was then prompted to take Ember into a fully-fledged VR world via a magical door. This is where you can take Ember for those all important ‘walkies’ that every dog needs. But this is where you’ll also be able to complete challenges, do trades for treats and other items, and more. The developers tell me that these challenges and activities will be updated regularly, but for those with a more relaxed approach, you can just go for a stroll and see what antics she gets up to if preferred. Again, referring back to that unscripted AI behaviour, you’re never quite sure what she’ll do. For example, in my play time, I was harvesting some berries and Ember decided to run off, only to return to be covered in mud – something I presumably would have had to deal with later if I had longer time playing.</p>



<p>The developers told me that this is just the beginning for the VR-world and that they do have plans to update the world in the future, but that it was still early days to announce anything. Hopefully, such updates to reflect the seasons is something that’s being considered to add another layer of immersion to the world, and I think seeing Ember react to the likes of crunchy leaves in Autumn or reacting to snow on the floor for the first would be particularly fun to watch.</p>



<p>In the demo, I was also introduced to the first voice command of “come” or “come here”, where after shouting, Ember would obey the command and return to you. Other voices commands like “sit” where also said to be coming to the game on launch, adding another layer of immersion to a game that stands out from the rest of the pet simulators on the market.</p>



<p>Overall, Stay: Forever Home breaks new ground on pet simulation, not only because of the use of the technology, but because of the caring nature of its developers that has created an experience that I don’t think can be replicated.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home launches on the Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 2 on April 3, 2025 where you can <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/stay-forever-home/8870151916378062/?srsltid=AfmBOoog3Z7zc5XUfg64IgVnaPPX2lIr8fr2VmzYYUUMPQdgl7iszzS8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add it to your wishlist here</a>.</p>
