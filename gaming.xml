            <p>A dataminer thinks they've stumbled upon the release date for Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero.</p>
<p>Poking around in publisher Bandai Namco's website, SergioM3R claims they found evidence that the next Dragon Ball game will drop on 1st October, 2024.</p>

<p>As detailed in the video above, SergioM3R has "found a place containing the release dates for a lot of Bandai Namco games", and the list seems to include the release dates of both confirmed and unconfirmed titles not via a third party, but via "Bandai Namco's own official data".</p>

<p>While the dataminer acknowledges that nothing's set in stone until we hear directly from Bandai itself, as the list includes confirmed release dates as well as speculative ones – of which all bar one are correct – it's plausible these, too, are real. Watch this space, I guess – maybe we'll find out more next month?</p> <div>

<p>Redditors on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cv5ocz/sparking_zero_release_date/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a> add further credence to the claims, reminding us that "1 was 10/06, 2 was 10/05, and 3 was 10/04, 4 on 10/03 would continue the pattern". It also backs up other recent leaks that hinted that the game was set to release in 2024 and not 2025, as some fans feared.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-has-secured-an-esrb-rating-as-a-hidden-video-pops-up-on-the-eu-youtube-account">Dragon Ball Sparking!

Toriyama was best known for his work as the creator of the Dragon Ball manga, which was then adapted into numerous anime series, films, and video games. He also worked on multiple video games and was responsible for the character designs in Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tiktok-has-brought-back-2000s-era-digital-cameras-%E2%80%94-and-it%E2%80%99s-worth-the-hype.875175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158881/tiktok-retro-digital-camera-trend<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8wE5kS">In a narrow hallway that divides the dance floor and the bathrooms at a local club, I saw some girls snapping photos. Instead of an iPhone, one of them held a retro digital camera above the group’s heads at an angle. The flash went off and I squeezed past them as they looked at the screen and giggled. It’s a small moment, but it’s also part of a much larger consumer trend. Now — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tiktok">thanks to TikTok</a> — ’90s- and 2000s-era handheld digital cameras are making a massive comeback, and I can say it’s one of the trends that’s actually well worth the hype.</p>
<p id="3Iye23">Affectionately dubbed “digi cams” online, point-and-shoot cameras have become the new darling technology of Instagram girlies everywhere. This is in large part due to TikTok, where content about digital cameras has turned into a major trend. There, a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trinatuyet/photo/7330261934010289450">simple photo slideshow</a> showing off a person’s favorite cameras can garner more than 2.4 million views. People share tips for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@suitelifeofzackandkody/video/7238309031079726362">getting into digital cameras</a>. Others talk about the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@autumnacord/video/7216387842115734826">best settings</a> to take the perfect glamour shot. Many people <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sunnyxjpg/video/7351540087093562667">rate the cameras in their collections</a>. Even the cameras themselves are fun, since people <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vateytathxoxo/video/7339543342528695585">decorate their cameras with sparkly stickers</a> and beaded wrist straps. </p>
<p id="zuFPrU">Nostalgia definitely plays a role in the hype. While some people are buying cheap (but new) cameras on the TikTok shop or choosing to shell out for more impressive new models, many of the videos emphasize that digital cameras <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katiecung/video/7271990798164479238">imbue the photos with that “vintage”</a> mom-and-dad vibe from the 1990s and 2000s (if that’s when your parents grew up, that is). Digital cameras have this nice in-between status where the pictures feel a little bit more retro and novel, but they don’t require the hassle or expertise of using film. But this is not just some sort of lo-fi trend — many of the photos do actually just look better than phone photos, thanks to a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katelym/video/7304040438728625438">proper flash</a> and <a href="https://www.imore.com/4-situations-when-digital-camera-better-iphone-camera">the mechanical advantages of using a camera with a bigger lens</a>. Of course, when browsing online, you can never be sure of how a photo might be doctored or edited, but <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@laurenwolfe/video/7212764119915695403">side-by-side comparisons with shots from iPhone cameras</a> attest to the added layers of color and warmth that snapping a selfie with a digital camera can add. So after mulling it over, I decided to take the $40 plunge and buy a retro camera of my own. </p>

<p id="LkTDrp">After seeing a clip on TikTok, I ended up getting a 2004 Canon PowerShot G6 because of how it seemed to capture golden light. The act of using a digital camera while out definitely feels different when compared to shooting a pic on an iPhone. With a phone, it’s easy to mindlessly mash the button and take dozens of photos in a matter of minutes. With the Canon, I took maybe two dozen photos during an entire night out, and the photos I did take I liked more than my average phone photos. Sometimes I felt disappointed by the number of blurry photos, but that didn’t take away from the charm of the experience. The photos that turned out well looked phenomenal — so much so that I already got one printed as a gift to a group of friends I had photographed on a night out. </p>
<p id="4tp7Pk">My iPhone camera tends to bring out an intense white color in direct sunlight, and features like its portrait mode often mistakenly smooth out my curly hair and awkwardly blur it out, as if it’s part of the background. Upon looking at the photos from my Canon for the first time, I was shocked by how the retro camera brought out the undertones in my skin and captured a warmer look. As a mixed person who often feels whitewashed in other (nonphotographic) ways, using an older digital camera felt affirming because it literally allowed me to see myself in a new light — one where I look browner, aka more like myself. Details like these might seem minor, but they matter to me. </p>
<p id="7bccu3">Online, a lot of the hype seems to come from how hot people can look if they use a point-and-shoot camera to take a picture, but for me, at least, it’s more than that. Looking at these photos, I feel more like myself in them. Now I can see depth on different parts of my face — like frizz from a certain part of my curl pattern, or a wrinkle in my smile that I didn’t see before. Sure, I don’t love lugging around another piece of technology, but the photos make it worth it. And for me personally, I don’t know if I’ll ever share an iPhone photo on my Instagram again. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-carbuncle-glamours-how-to-change-a-summons-color/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ffxiv-carbuncle-glamours-how-to-change-a-summons-color<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="267" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Both Summoners and Scholars in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> are able to summon a pet to their side, which helps them in battle and supports them in times of need. You can summon them from early on, but if you want to change the appearance, you’ll need to be at least level 50.</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">If you’re playing as Summoner or Scholar, you’ll have either a Carbuncle or Eos at your side while exploring Eorzea. While the original is nice, there are options that allow you to customize the appearance of your pet.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">Before you ask, no, you can’t have a white Carbuncle whether you’re playing as a Summoner or Scholar, even though we’ve seen at least one in Final Fantasy XIV previously. Alphinaud, the lucky duck, has a Moonstone Carbuncle that he claims to be the final result of his research. Unfortunately, he hasn’t passed on his knowledge, so we’re unable to follow suit with our own white pet.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-change-the-appearance-of-your-pet-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to change the appearance of your pet in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Before you can even begin to think about changing your pet’s appearance, you’ll need to reach level 50 as either a Summoner or a Scholar. Once you’ve done this, head to Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks and speak to Thubyrgeim (X:4.7, Y:11.4) in the Arcanist’s Guild while equipped as a Summoner. Pick up the quest called “An Egi by Any Other Name” and complete the simple steps.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to freely change the way your pet appears to yourself and everyone around you. It’s worth noting that changing the appearance of your pet is purely cosmetic and has no effect on the way it acts during battle.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The command you’re going to want to memorize is as follows:</p> <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “egi name” “glamour” ”</p> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">Now, I’m going to take a second here to explain what on earth an ‘Egi’ is. ‘Egi’ is a suffix meaning ‘essense of’. Essentially, your pet is the ‘Egi’, whether you’re a Scholar with Eos at your side or a Summoner with a Carbuncle. Either way, that’s your ‘Egi’. Now that you know that, hopefully, this makes more sense.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Anyway, the “egi name” section of this input will differ depending on if you’re playing as a Summoner or a Scholar. For Summoners, this will need to be changed to “carbuncle” while for Scholars, this will need to be changed to “eos”.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">The “glamour” section of the input is the most important part, and you have a few options regardless of which Job you’re playing, as well as some that are unique to each Job. Here are all of the things that can replace “glamour” in this input:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Change “glamour” to</strong></td><td><strong>Changes appearance to</strong></td></tr><tr><td>“Emerald Carbuncle”</td><td>Blue colored Carbuncle</td></tr><tr><td>“Topaz Carbuncle”</td><td>Yellow colored Carbuncle</td></tr><tr><td>“Ruby Carbuncle”</td><td>Red colored Carbuncle</td></tr><tr><td>“Titan-egi”</td><td>Small floating Titan (Summoner only)</td></tr><tr><td>“Garuda-egi”</td><td>Small floating Garuda (Summoner only)</td></tr><tr><td>“Ifrit-egi”</td><td>Small floating Ifrit (Summoner only)</td></tr><tr><td>“Selene”</td><td>Replaces Eos with Selene (Scholar only)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">So, with all this information, here’s a couple of examples to hopefully make things more clear:</p> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">If you’re a Summoner who wants to replace the default blue Carbuncle with a small version of Garuda who follows you everywhere, you’d input the following into the chat box:</p> <p data-characters="52" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “carbuncle” “garuda-egi” ”</p> <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">Or if you’re a Scholar who wants to change Eos into a Ruby Carbuncle capable of healing you at all times, you’d input:</p>
 <p data-characters="50" data-current-count="50" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “eos” “ruby carbuncle” ”</p> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">If you’ve already got your pet summoned when you type in this input, you’ll need to summon them again before the changes will appear.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="60" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Here are all of the different appearances in picture format:</p> <figure data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false"> <figure></figure> <figure></figure> <figure></figure> <figcaption>Screenshots by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-remove-a-glamour-from-a-pet-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to remove a glamour from a pet in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">If you’re not happy with your choice to change the appearance of your pet, say you want Eos back at your side while playing as Scholar rather than the Ruby Carbuncle, you can easily remove the glamour by inputting the first part of the glamouring input while leaving out the second part:</p>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false">“ /egiglamour “eos” ”</p>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For those who don’t know, the Hugo Awards are the penultimate sci-fi and fantasy awards. Their judges pick the best books, novels, and other related media that stand out from their peers and give them the notice they deserve.&nbsp;Held yearly, the nominations for the best novels of 2023 have been announced, with the winner to be revealed&nbsp;on August 11th.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Sci-fi and Fantasy are&nbsp;wide&nbsp;genres, covering&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;ground and types of novels. Curious about this year’s nominees?&nbsp;Wondering&nbsp;if any would fit the&nbsp;type&nbsp;of book you’re looking for?&nbsp;Here&nbsp;we’ll&nbsp;go over&nbsp;this year’s nominees, why they deserve the nod, and discuss what kind of readers might&nbsp;get the most enjoyment from each book.</p>
 <h2 id="h-starter-villain-by-john-scalzi" data-injectable="false">Starter Villain by John Scalzi</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">John Scalzi is no stranger to the Hugos, having been nominated multiple times and won once.&nbsp;He’s an author who runs the gamut as far as writing style goes, having written space operas that explore humanity’s desire to grow, as well as&nbsp;fun romps that elicit giggles more than anything else.&nbsp;Starter Villian would seem to trend to the latter rather than the former, but beyond a goofy and hilarious exterior are some solid critiques of late-stage capitalism and the current villains of our age.</p>
 <p data-characters="538" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">Imagine Ron Stoppable inheriting his deceased&nbsp;uncle’s&nbsp;supervillain business, complete with an island lair, as well as&nbsp;a suite of enemies still looking to take what’s theirs.&nbsp;The premise is as fun as it sounds, but what got this book nominated are the critiques that come later.&nbsp;While the&nbsp;Uncle&nbsp;was an old&nbsp;type of supervillain, those that are&nbsp;coming after him are the newer type: Tech bros backed by hedge funds, CEOs of giant corporations, and the nepo baby powerful born with money, having earned nothing themselves.</p>
 <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="177" data-injectable="false">For readers&nbsp;who are&nbsp;looking for a bit of a laugh, who love the idea of talking spy cats, or who just like seeing the ultra-wealthy fail, this will be the book for you.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh</h2> <figure data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Emily Tesh is a newer name to the Hugos, but her nomination is no less deserved. Some Desperate Glory is a deconstruction of the Space Opera genre, showing the darkness that lurks beneath many of the near-future human societies&nbsp;that we&nbsp;root for. Tesh masterfully dissects the things we don’t question that we maybe should, showing a new way forward that subverts the traditional structure of many classic sci-fi epics.</p>
 <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Our main character is one of the last remaining humans, raised from birth&nbsp;the&nbsp;enact&nbsp;vengeance on those&nbsp;that crossed&nbsp;them.&nbsp;Excelling at&nbsp;combat and frustrated with her role as a breeder to keep humanity alive,&nbsp;she sets&nbsp;out against orders to enact the vengeance she had&nbsp;been trained&nbsp;for.&nbsp;While&nbsp;vengeance is a powerful motivator, anger is also perfecting at&nbsp;blinding us&nbsp;to the evils we&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;commit.&nbsp;Tesh questions the nature of such ruling governments and how they use sexism, racism, eugenics, and more, throwing back the curtain that readers for years have been fine never looking behind.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">For those who love subversions of standard tropes, tales of vengeance gone awry, or&nbsp;who&nbsp;want a YA-adjacent novel that asks&nbsp;harder&nbsp;questions than you would expect, Some Desperate Glory is a solid choice.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Witch King by Martha Wells</h2> <figure data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="572" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Martha Wells is a well-known name in the sci-fi genre, with her Murderbot series already having several accolades. She seeks&nbsp;now&nbsp;to prove that no one genre can contain her as we move into her new Witch King novel, a fantasy thriller. Wells continues doing what she does best in this novel, creating incredibly real-to-life characters and throwing us into their world. While the world-building can feel breakneck for some, this gives us more time to understand the cast of characters that&nbsp;are introduced, endearing us to them in ways few authors can achieve.</p>
 <p data-characters="611" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">The novel tells two stories, both&nbsp;following the titular Witch King, Kai.&nbsp;The narrative is told from two perspectives, one past and one present, building a history of a world that Kai sought to&nbsp;overthrow&nbsp;and a future after he was betrayed and imprisoned for years. Wells is a master of passive worldbuilding, so expect bits and pieces to&nbsp;be doled out&nbsp;over the whole course of the&nbsp;novel&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;large&nbsp;explanations. Still, as always, the inner workings of Well’s characters&nbsp;truly&nbsp;bring it home.&nbsp;No one writes a protagonist quite like Wells, and she&nbsp;doesn’t falter with the Witch King.</p>
 <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false">For those who love a good antihero, want to be immersed in a deep world without infodumps, or just love character over everything else in a story, read The Witch King.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by S. A. Chakraborty</h2> <figure data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Harper Collins</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Chakraborty made a name for herself with her City of Brass series, bringing to life a world of Middle Eastern mythology that hasn’t seen as much fiction written about it. In the Adventures of Amina&nbsp;al-Sirafi,&nbsp;we are graced with the same intelligent writing and well-researched world-building that we expect from her, but now used to tell a tale about reaching for glory one last time.</p> <p data-characters="678" data-current-count="1070" data-injectable="true">The story follows the eponymous Amina al-Sirafi, once feared pirate of the Indian Ocean, now retired and living with her daughter in solitude. Still, when an opportunity comes for one last score, she can’t resist the itch that calls her back. The book has the feel of many heist novels, following Amina as she gets the gang back together for one last score. Still, the book is separated from the rest by vivid descriptions and incredible historical and mythological research that makes the world feel so much more alive, as well as the discussion and interest it gives to Amina’s plight, being a mid 40’s woman seeking to get back into a world she left behind.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">For&nbsp;those who want some good old swashbuckling action, want to read about a world and mythology that&nbsp;isn’t focused&nbsp;on often enough, or&nbsp;who&nbsp;want to read a thoughtful discussion of the give and take of returning to a life you left behind, this book will be perfect.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Saint of Bright Doors by Vajra Chandrasekera</h2> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan Publishers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">Perhaps the most literary title on this list, The Saint of Bright&nbsp;Doors&nbsp;is a lot of&nbsp;things.&nbsp;It is a look at the mythology of Sri Lankan Buddhists, a takedown of religion-led societies, and a discussion on colonialism, all wrapped in a surrealist shell that defies effort to define it. The book sinks&nbsp;itself&nbsp;into these questions and themes, moving at a slower pace to give readers ample time to understand the author’s points or to form questions of their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">The book follows Fetter, a once-destined assassin who forwent his calling, now wandering the world unsure, instead focusing on bright doors that have begun appearing in his home city. The book can often be hard to follow, shifting between more standard passages and incredibly dreamlike ones, where the focus and narrative shift constantly. Still, for those that stick with it, the payoffs are&nbsp;wonderful, bringing to life a vibrant and alive&nbsp;city&nbsp;and in a&nbsp;way that is breathtaking&nbsp;to read.</p>
 <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">For those who love to get lost in prose, often read more literary works on the side, or want to explore a surreal and beautiful world of mythology retold, pick up Chandrasekera’s novel.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Translation State by Ann Leckie</h2> <figure data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hachette</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">Leckie won a Hugo&nbsp;previously for the novel Ancillary Justice.&nbsp;In Translation State, we return to this same universe, though&nbsp;the book can be read&nbsp;as a standalone for the uninitiated.&nbsp;The book is full of Leckie’s usual charm, endearing characters fighting for what they believe in, told in a&nbsp;way that feels cozy and inviting.&nbsp;This novel once again focuses on the issues of the future, but rather&nbsp;than focusing on the danger of empires and other Space Opera tropes, Translation State instead chooses to focus on social aspects.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">The book focuses on three separate characters, each with their problems but with one overarching thread tying them together: How do our genetics affect us? Do they determine who we are? Are we bound by these ideas predetermined at birth? The characters&nbsp;each&nbsp;grapple with this question in their own way, exploring from many angles the&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;of self-determination rather than our genetics deciding who we&nbsp;are&nbsp;and the trials we must go through to enact change that allows us to live in the ways we want.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">For those who like books that ask questions of the future, enjoy good character as a primary motivator, or want a great way to understand many of the social&nbsp;quandaries&nbsp;that affect us today, read Translation State.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Welcome to Stardew Valley, where each season brings a new crop of bountiful food to make for friends and family," teases the blurb. "From farm staples like veggies, fruit, milk, and eggs to foraged mushrooms and berries to fresh fish, there's always something delicious to put on the table.</p>
<p>"These 50 recipes are based on in-game meals and food, allowing you to cook and eat all your home-grown and fresh-caught ingredients in real life. The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook is organised by season and has recipes from your favourite characters, including the Queen of Sauce and Gus at the Stardrop Saloon. Written in collaboration with independent game creator ConcernedApe and packed with original illustrations and food photography, The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook helps you bring the Valley's incredible flavours to the dinner table, giving you the energy to take on the world."</p>
<p>Sadly, the US <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/719873/the-official-stardew-valley-cookbook-by-concernedape-and-ryan-novak/">Penguin Random House website</a> doesn't ship to the UK, but you may be able to find the Stardew Valley Cookbook via third-party sellers on Amazon UK.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first video game to roll out an accompanying cookbook; mostly recently we told you about recipes inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neopets-starts-its-25th-anniversary-celebrations-early-with-this-new-cookbook">Neopets</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-official-minecraft-cookbook-is-on-the-way">Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-that-five-nights-at-freddys-cookbook-youve-always-dreamed-about">Five Nights At Freddy's</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-official-halo-cookbook-has-been-revealed">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destinys-official-cookbook-launches-in-two-weeks">Destiny 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-final-fantasy-14-cookbook-coming-out-later-this-year">Final Fantasy 14</a> have also spawned food-related spin-offs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone said he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">"not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In an interview about his plans for Stardew Valley's following its recent 1.6 update, Barone said that he doesn't feel pressured to create a follow-up game, stating: "It's a game that I'm deciding to make. I don't need to make it".</p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>, the long-running film franchise now has ten films. Throughout its semicentennial lifespan, the series has undergone several drastic evolutions, going from meditative science-fiction epics to corny blockbusters and back again multiple times.</p> <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">No two<em> Planet of the Apes </em>films are alike; needless to say, some are better than others. Here are our rankings of all the <em>Planet of the Apes</em> series films, from worst to best.</p> <h2 id="h-10-planet-of-the-apes-2001" data-injectable="false"><strong>10. <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (2001)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Planet Of The Apes | #TBT Trailer | 20th Century FOX" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-a4eIA8KWM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">After an almost forty-year hiatus, 2001’s <em>Planet of the Apes</em> set out to bring the series back into the spotlight. With acclaimed director Tim Burton at the helm, everyone assumed <em>Planet of the Apes</em> would put the series back on the map.</p> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">It did, but not in the way <em>Planet of the Apes </em>fans had hoped it would. While Rick Baker’s prosthetic effects are undeniably impressive, the film’s decision to trade the original’s thoughtful social commentary for easily digestible man vs. ape action left the film feeling shallow. Coupled with a wooden cast of human leads and a muddled plot ending in a frustratingly confusing “plot twist,” it’s easy to see why Burton’s take sent the series into another extended hibernation.</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-battle-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-1973" data-injectable="false"><strong>9. <em>Battle for the Planet of the Apes</em> (1973)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">The final film in the original Planet of the Apes saga, <em>Battle for the Planet of the Apes</em> chronicles Caesar’s attempt to preserve the fragile peace between the apes and humans who survived nuclear armageddon. Unfortunately, a militant gorilla general and a league of anti-ape humans soon rise to challenge Caesar’s ideals.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false"><em>Battle for the Planet of the Apes </em>benefits from an enticing premise and a strong performance by lead actor Roddy McDowell<em>. </em>However, the film’s exceptionally shotty costume design and limp climax prevent it from being the epic, cathartic finale it could have been.</p> <h2 id="h-8-beneath-the-planet-of-the-apes-1970" data-injectable="false"><strong>8. <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em> (1970)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Trailer #1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOSEpi8K-XM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Despite being a direct sequel to the original <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em> is anything but a by-the-books continuation. Turning the camera away from the apes and introducing a tribe of telepathic, subterranean humans, <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em> is the strangest and most controversial film in the series.</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">While some viewers applaud <em>Beneath the Planet of the Apes</em>‘ willingness to defy audience expectations, others are critical of the film’s surreal atmosphere and surprisingly bleak tone.</p>
 <h2 id="h-7-conquest-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1972" data-injectable="false"><strong>7. <em>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</em> (1972)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The darkest film in the series, <em>Conquest of the Planet of the Ape</em>s shoves the series’ underlying themes of oppression and revolution to the forefront. Set in a post-plague United States where apes are slaves, the film follows the time-traveling chimpanzee Cornelius and Zira’s son Milo’s transforming from a meek circus ape to a violent revolutionary.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Wearing its political undertones on its sleeves, <em>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</em> is a gritty, angry film that thoroughly explores humanity’s capacity for violence. While the version that made its way to theaters toned things down by changing its brutal ending, the film remains a haunting meditation on the horrors of slavery and the consequences of violent uprisings.</p> <h2 id="h-6-planet-of-the-apes-1968" data-injectable="false"><strong>6. <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (1968)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Planet of the Apes (1968) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0-dUM_A-Cg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">The film that started it all, the original Planet of the Apes is a film that everyone knows about, if only through pop-culture osmosis. Following the trials and triumphs of an astronaut stranded in a world where apes rule, the film is as iconic as it is for a reason.</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">With a compelling premise, powerhouse lead, and an intriguing story that ends in one of the most iconic twists of all time, <em>Planet of the Apes</em> is one of the most influential science-fiction movies ever made.</p>
 <h2 id="h-5-escape-from-the-planet-of-the-apes-1971" data-injectable="false"><strong>5. <em>Escape from the Planet of the Apes</em> (1971)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">Despite <em>Beneath the Planet Apes</em>‘s best efforts, <em>Escape from the Planet of the Apes</em> found a new way to keep the original franchise going: time travel. In an attempt to escape the impending demise of their world, chimpanzee scientists Cornelius and Zira travel back in time to the then-present year of 1971, with their presence creating a self-fulfilling time-loop that will change the future of humans and apes forever.</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Sporting a well-written script and powerful performances from its costumed leads, <em>Escape from the Planet of the Apes</em> weaves an emotional story about empathy, parenthood, and racial unrest that’s as relevant today as it was over fifty years ago.</p> <h2 id="h-4-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2024" data-injectable="false"><strong>4. <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> (2024)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true">The newest film in the series, <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>, picks up where Matt Reeves’ Planet of the Apes trilogy left off, with the civilization of apes led by Casaer firmly established as the dominant species on the planet. The film follows Noa, a young chimpanzee who must journey across the post-apocalyptic United States to rescue his tribe from the mad dictator Proximus Caesar, leading him toward a fateful encounter with a young human named Mae.</p>
 <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes </em>has many great things going for it, including top-tier special effects and an excellent cast of characters with fun and exciting relationships. While the film does more sequel-baiting than I would have liked, it’s still a fun, heartfelt experience that stands on its own as a solid series relaunch.</p> <h2 id="h-3-rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2011" data-injectable="false"><strong>3. <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em> (2011)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">The first entry in Matt Reeve’s three-part revival, <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes, </em>is an excellent start to the franchise’s most recent chapter. The film follows Caesar, a chimpanzee taken into the home of the kind researcher who rescues him from an inhumane laboratory. From there, Caesar experiences humanity’s capacity for unconditional love and unflinching cruelty, transforming into the leader who helps other rapidly evolving apes find freedom.</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false"><em>Rise of the Planet of the Ape is</em> everything movie-goers look for in a reboot. With an intelligent script that stays true to the series’ themes, some well-shot action, and a compelling new protagonist, <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes </em>is the triumphant return to form that fans of the series had spent decades waiting for.</p> <h2 id="h-2-war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-2017" data-injectable="false"><strong>2. <em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> (2017)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 20th Century Fox</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> brings Matt Reeves’ trilogy to a brutal, beautiful, and bittersweet end. After a ruthless militia declares war on Caesar’s tribe, he and his people embark on an epic journey that forces the increasingly-messianic ruler to question what kind of future he’s built for his family and whether his pacifistic approach to human-ape relations will bring prosperity or ruin.</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false"><em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> lives up to its title in every way imaginable, with the filmmakers drawing clear inspiration from war movies like <em>Apocalypse Now </em>and <em>The Bridge on the River Kwai</em>. With another well-written screenplay that analyzes the cyclical nature of violence and the renewing power of hope, <em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em> is an epic conclusion to an already fantastic trilogy.</p> <h2 id="h-1-dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2014" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em> (2014)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Dawn of the Planet of the Apes | Official Trailer [HD] | PLANET OF THE APES" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3sHMCRaS3ao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes </em>is one of those rare middle chapters of a trilogy that surpasses the films that came before and after it. Ten years after the simian flu outbreak, Caesar and his tribe are approached by a group of humans who want to ally with them, sparking tension between him and his second in command, Koba.</p> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="false">To put it bluntly, <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Ape</em> is everything you’d want out of a <em>Planet of the Apes</em> movie: gorgeous special effects, excellent cinematography, and compelling conflict that makes it hard to tell at times who’s in the right and who’s in the wrong. Whether you’re in the mood for some top-tier action or up for an emotional tour de force, <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em> is for you.</p>

<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When it comes to video games, there are a lot of memorable characters. Outside of their design or role within a game, what makes these characters memorable is their voice, and every one of these comes as a result of actors spending hours in a recording booth.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">There are a lot of voice actors out there, but some are more prolific or memorable than others. Their voices resonate in our heads as part of the characters we come to love while playing, but who’s behind these voices and where else have they appeared?</p> <h2 id="h-joel-miller-the-last-of-us-troy-baker" data-injectable="false">Joel Miller (<em>The Last of Us</em>) – Troy Baker</h2> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Naughty Dog</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">Troy Baker might be one of the most well-known voices in video games. He’s not only the voice of Joel in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-no-return-mode-explained-is-it-worth-it/">The Last of Us</a></em> but also Higgs Monaghan in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hideo-kojimas-death-stranding-documentary-is-available-for-streaming-now/">Death Stranding</a></em>, John Jones in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/epic-says-it-will-appeal-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-in-fortnite/">Fortnite</a></em>, The Joker in <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em>, and the voice of Snow in multiple <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, including <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-harley-quinn-arkham-city-tara-strong" data-injectable="false">Harley Quinn (<em>Arkham City</em>) – Tara Strong&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Rocksteady Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Tara Strong is a voice that’s iconic for multiple generations. To me, she’s Timmy from <em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>. To my daughter, she’s Princess Twilight Sparkle from the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/as-a-parent-i-cant-wait-for-my-little-pony-a-zephyr-heights-mystery-heres-why/">My Little Pony</a></em> franchise. In video games, Tara has played not only Harley Quinn in multiple titles, but you can also hear her voice in <em>Rage</em>, and she’s the voice of Rikku in <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>.</p>  <figure data-current-count="663" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">While David Hayter is perhaps most well known for his role as Snake in the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> franchise and outside of it in other titles, he’s also appeared as the Winter Soldier in <em>Marvel Heroes</em>, a Jedi Knight in <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>, and has multiple voice roles in the <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> game, released in 1997.</p> <h2 id="h-mario-multiple-charles-martinet" data-injectable="false">Mario (Multiple) – Charles Martinet</h2> <figure data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">I can’t in all good conscience write this list without including Charles Martinet. His voice simply <em>is</em> Mario to anyone who has ever played a single game of the franchise. However, Mario isn’t Charles’ only voice role in the world of video games. He’s appeared as Orvus in <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time</em>, Vigoro in <em>Skies of Arcadia</em>, and, perhaps surprisingly, The Cat in the Hat in a few titles aimed at kids, such as <em>Dr. Seuss Toddler</em>.&nbsp;</p>

However, before he was the voice of Asterion, Neil appeared in the <em>Resident Evil</em> games as Karl Heisenberg in <em>Resident Evil Village</em> and Nicholai in <em>Resident Evil Resistance</em>. He also played two roles in <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, Elijah Kamski and Gavin Reed.</p>

I was, and remain to this day, obsessed with <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> and will always consider it the best of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> titles. However, Roger Craig Smith has appeared in many more video games. He’s played Kale Vandelay and SEB-AAA in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-release-despite-the-death-of-its-developer/">Hi-Fi RUSH</a></em>, Sonic the Hedgehog in multiple titles and Mirage in Apex Legends. Most recently, you might recognize his voice as Mission Control in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/">Helldivers 2</a></em>.</p>

She’s the voice of Aloy in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, Nebula in<em> Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series</em>, Mel in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and also provided the voice of Chloe Price in both <em>Life is Strange</em> games.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-urianger-final-fantasy-xiv-timothy-watson" data-injectable="false">Urianger (<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>) – Timothy Watson</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Aside from gracing the world with the purely Shakespearean presence that is Urianger Augurelt in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, Timothy Watson has also appeared in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> as King Burgred, has multiple voice roles in <em>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</em>, and played Mumkhar in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-glados-portal-ellen-mcclain" data-injectable="false">GLaDOS (<em>Portal</em>) – Ellen McClain</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Valve</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true">The voice of everybody’s favorite psychopathic robot from the <em>Portal </em>games was provided by Ellen McClain, but it wasn’t the first time she provided an iconic robotic female voice in the world of video games. Ellen is also the voice behind the Combine Overwatch AI in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/this-youtuber-has-been-uploading-half-life-3-updates-every-day-for-over-six-years/">Half-Life</a> 2</em>. She also appears in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> as one of Delamain’s split personalities, though this one was modeled after GlaDOS.</p>

Outside of gaming, Doug also played the role of Father John Maloney in 2001’s <em>Band of Brothers</em>.</p>

  <p id="lUcMOb">It’s a good time to be an X-Men fan. The stellar first season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24158520/x-men-97-season-1-review"><em>X-Men ‘97</em></a><em> </em>just wrapped up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22665398/wolverine-marvel-insomniac-games-playstation">Insomniac Games is working on a Wolverine game</a> for PlayStation 5, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23344459/x-men-marvel-movies-mcu">the mutants are (someday) coming to the MCU</a>.</p>
<p id="xGM35c">But it’s been a while since there have been good options for X-Men fans who want to game in that universe. Gone are the days of multiple X-Men arcade games and fighting games to choose from, or movie tie-ins. There have been a lot of disappointing X-Men games (looking at you, <em>X-Men: Destiny</em>), but what about the good ones?</p>
<p id="BG9P48">The Polygon staff has collected the X-Men games that are actually good, from the dawn of <s>the mutant age</s> gaming to even a few recent releases that revive X-Men gaming. Most are not available to play anymore, but they live on in our hearts nonetheless.</p>

<p id="pRZ0cj">Ideally, you’ll be playing <em>X-Men</em> on an original arcade cabinet alongside three strangers, the four of you thrown together into a makeshift family as you step into the shoes of Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Colossus, Nightcrawler or Dazzler. It won’t take long to beat — maybe 30-45 minutes, like a great episode of television — and you’ll walk away victorious, having destroyed Sentinels and other classic baddies until you reach Magneto, who has kidnapped Xavier for some reason (although if you’ve seen <em>X-Men ‘97</em>, you might be able to imagine some good reasons). </p>
<p id="sK5pca">This game is an all-time classic for a reason; each character has different special abilities, just like the characters they’re based on, and as simplistic as the beat-em-up mechanics may be, it’s still one of the most accurate and fun adaptations that the X-Men have ever had across video games. Oddly enough, this version of the team was actually based on the failed 1989 cartoon <em>X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men</em> that got one pilot episode and no more, but the X-Men have such distinctive visual designs that this part never really mattered. —<em>Maddy Myers</em></p>

<p id="92MRbg">This may shock you, but there are few better-looking Genesis games than <em>X-Men 2: Clone Wars</em>. It is shocking how richly detailed its 16-bit graphics are, and how finely-tuned its action feels. Headgames’ side-scrolling platformer has a number of flourishes uncommon in licensed games at the time, from a cold open that drops you into the game as a random character the moment you start it to a surprisingly involved story ripped from the recently-wrapped “Phalanx Covenant” comics arc. What’s more, <em>Clone Wars</em> beat <em>X2</em> to one of its big twists — midway through the game, Magneto joins the team, and he looks freaking sick. —<em>Joshua Rivera</em></p>

<p id="0hBYDl">Both <em>X-Men Legends</em> games were squad-based action role-playing games that fully leaned into the team nature of the X-Men, allowing you to bring four of the mutants into missions at once. Both games’ combat were simple but evocative, and successfully leaned on the varied abilities of the different X-Men. The roster was pretty deep, too — the first game had 14 playable characters (plus Professor X on specific missions), and the sequel added some from Magneto’s Brotherhood of mutants as well.</p>
<p id="NdJoLL">The main reason these games feel so fitting for the X-Men franchise to me is the team-based nature, an essential part of the X-Men’s whole deal. And they were even more fun co-op — I have many fond memories of playing and replaying these games (or even just the Danger Room missions) with my brother growing up.</p>
<p id="WjvvP6">Additional shoutout to the also quite fun Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, the successor to these games from Raven Software and Activision, expanding the scope to the broader Marvel universe. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="7cmFlu">For most of video games’ short history, a licensed game based on a good movie was rarely very good. A licensed game based on a terrible one? A fool’s errand. As the kids say, <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> had no business going this hard. In an unusual move, Raven Software’s flagship PS3 and Xbox 360 version of Wolverine was an M-rated game significantly more violent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23380553/deadpool-3-wolverine-x-men-origins-ryan-reynolds-hugh-jackman">than the film it was based on</a>, resulting in a <em>God of War</em>-inspired bloody hack-and-slash adventure, blending the movie’s storyline with an expanded original plot. The result was a brutally satisfying video game, and sadly the end of Raven’s excellent tenure on Marvel titles that kicked off with <em>X-Men Legends</em>. In a few short years, the studio would be altogether done developing its own games as well, shifting into a new role as a Call of Duty support studio. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="vnD5QT">Starting with <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> (1996) and landing with a thud on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/18/16323994/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review"><em>Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite</em></a> (2017), the X-Men/Capcom crossover fighting game series has had its ups and downs, and even as I write this blurb, I’m second-guessing my own attempt to select the best of the entire run. Several entries have strong points in their favor (we need not speak of <em>Infinite</em>). But you can’t <em>not</em> vote for Rogue’s iconic divekick, which she first performs in <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> and which features its final appearance in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22648751/marvel-vs-capcom-2-classic-quest-retro-gaming-capcom-fighting-game-community"><em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em></a>. It’s a move so beloved that it got a nod in <em>X-Men ‘97</em>. If you want to not only see but <em>be </em>Rogue when she’s punching people’s lights out — and who doesn’t? — you cannot do better than <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>. —<em>MM</em></p>

<p id="thpBi9">Simply put: <em>Children of the Atom</em> walked so <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> could run. The developer’s first entry into what would be a wildly popular series of Marvel fighting games is barebones compared to the 3v3 spectacle later games would be known for, but those bones are solid: It’s effectively a maximalist version of <em>Street Fighter</em> circa 1994, with longer combos, super jumps, and new movesets that would continue to be refined as its characters appeared in subsequent Marvel fighting games. But its most significant achievement might be in its character design: Faithful yet idiosyncratic, the X-Men as rendered in <em>Children of the Atom</em> are unmistakably Capcom designs, with just a hint of <em>Street Fighter: Alpha’s</em> anime inflection, but also pitch-perfect tributes to <em>X-Men</em> artist Jim Lee. The proof was in the pudding: Arcade players could fight Street Fighter villain Akuma as a secret character, and console players could play as him themselves — and he fit right in. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="rI4kze">I know what you’re thinking: “Is this an X-Men game?” Wolverine, Magik, and Storm are in it — plus Deadpool, who at least works with the X-Men often enough, and Scarlet Witch, who is sometimes a mutant depending on the canon — so we’re letting this one in. Perhaps more importantly, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> has the <em>vibe </em>of the best X-Men stories. This is a team-up strategy game, with super-powered characters all thrown unwittingly together in a strange mansion. In battle, they’ll trade barbs and one-liners; back at home, they’ll romance each other and bicker. If that’s not quintessential X-Men, what is? —<em>MM</em></p>

<p id="4I2Qug"><em>X-Men Cartoon Maker</em> is not so much a game as it is a sandbox for creating your very own episodes of <em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em> using character models, sound effects, and background images from the original show, plus a sound library of funky ‘90s instrumental tracks that mostly seem fitting as backing tracks for fight scenes and dramatic standoffs (for which the show was known, of course). Composing scenes and using the rudimentary cartooning tools does feel clunky, but the end results can be uniquely hilarious. Check out this high-effort piece of art uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVLxUVA7ds8">YouTube</a> by one diligent X-Men Cartoon Maker fan for an example of what you can pull off. —<em>MM</em></p>

<p id="WoYcsz">Some may argue with my inclusion of this 1993 Sega Genesis exclusive based on its grueling difficulty, but I’d like to make my case based on the attention to detail for each of the four playable characters and its truly infamous end-game stunt. Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Gambit are all present, and each come with unique, character-appropriate powers. Cyclops does his laser blasts, Nightcrawler teleports, Wolverine snickety snicks, and Gambit throws playing cards (I’m sorry Gambit fans, it’s always been weird). </p>
<p id="YJKX0V">You play as these four X-Men, trapped in the Danger Room, and your “lives” are simply the four playable characters. Since each has unique abilities, successfully finishing this action platformer meant carefully budgeting your approach to each level and boss. Which makes the late-game stunt all the more wild: In order to end the Danger Room simulation, you need to <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25453192/vlcsnap_2024_05_17_15h36m31s194.png">“reset the computer”</a> which you’d think would accomplished by pressing a button on the controller, presumably “press F to pay respects” style, right?</p>
<p id="CjyXYN">Nope! You tap the actual “Reset” button on the Sega Genesis! And if you press it too long, it actually resets the Genesis and you lose all your progress. This was 1993! I applaud the absolute sickos who made this game the stuff of schoolyard lore, and my apologies to everyone retraumatized by this memory. —<em>Chris Grant</em></p>

<p id="OzC8Ch">While many will know <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074262/cmon-gamefound-exclusivity-agreement">CMON</a> for its action-packed cooperative board game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/25/20932599/zombicide-second-edition-kickstarter"><em>Zombicide</em></a>, the tabletop publisher has a much newer series called <em>Marvel United</em>. The original game earned more than $2.8 million on Kickstarter in 2020, only to be followed by <a href="https://www.cmon.com/products/marvel-united-x-men/"><em>Marvel United: X-Men</em></a> with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/marvel-united-x-men/description">nearly $6 million in funding</a>. </p>
<p id="OGUolC">This card-driven action game puts players in the role of X-Men mutants like Wolverine, Jean Grey, Storm, and Cyclops as they go up against Magneto, Juggernaut and more. The big draw here are the adorable, chibi-style miniature characters. The big-headed heroes are an absolute joy to paint, and at $34.99 the game is extremely affordable. —<em>Charlie Hall </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-strongest-fantasy-villains-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-strongest-fantasy-villains-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Can a hero even be called cool if they never face opponents who test their limits? We want to see odds that look insurmountable, even for supermen who shoot lasers from their eyes and manage to hide their identity only by wearing a pair of glasses.</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false">While it might seem like too daunting of a task, fiction authors sure have done a great job at diving into their scariest nightmares to pull out these absolute monsters.</p>  <figure data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-t-1000-terminator-2" data-injectable="false">10. T-1000 (Terminator 2)</h2> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">The T-1000 is as close as a good AI — not a real-world one — was able to come to the perfect killing machine. Its body is composed entirely of liquid metal, meaning that bullets can, at best, hope to slow him down a little. He has full control over the metallic goo he’s made of, meaning that he can conjure swords and even impersonate anyone he sees.</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">How scary is the T-1000? Well, if regular Arnold Schwarzenegger is already pretty scary, then remember that this guy is even more powerful than a robot version of Arnie.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Giygas (Earthbound)</h2> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Giygas from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/earthbound-so-whats-the-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earthbound</a></em> is an alien lifeform who can will reality into collapsing. It serves as a very enticing final villain not just because he has world-ending powers but also because he’ll fill your brain with imagery so foul that you might lose your mind long before you perish.</p>
 <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false">In all fairness, though, this being of immense cosmic power does end up getting defeated by a bunch of kids, so there’s that.</p> <figure data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by WB</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Adrien Veidt/ Ozymandias (Watchmen)</h2> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">Adrien Veidt’s most dangerous trait is thinking that he’s a good guy. He believes he has the ability to save the world, whatever that might mean, so he stops at nothing to achieve his goals. </p> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">Ozymandias, his “heroic” alter-ego, ends up murdering hundreds of thousands of people after his master plan succeeds, but we never see any guarantee that his awful actions will ever even lead to postponing the end of the world. What scares me the most about Ozymandias is that he makes me sometimes wonder if there’s one rich person out there who can one day pull this off. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">7. Sauron (The Lord Of The Rings)</h2> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Sauron is the quintessential super warlord of the Fantasy genre. He was powerful enough as an evil shapeshifter, but powerful enough is never enough when you are a supervillain. He also created an artifact that bestowed upon him immense power and the ability to enslave the minds of some of the most powerful inhabitants of Middle Earth.</p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">Sauron is unbeatable in combat as long as he’s wearing the One Ring and will never die unless you destroy the ring — a task that I’ve heard isn’t particularly easy.</p>  <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">6. Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII, Kingdom Hearts, Super Smash Bros.)</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">Sephiroth is a highly trained SOLDIER who also benefits from sharing a genetic bloodline with a race of alien deities. He’s too drunk with power to be slowed down by any sense of empathy or mercy, but that isn’t even the scariest thing about him. Sephiroth is one of the few villains in media who can nullify the hero’s ability to always save their love (?) interest.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">When not trying to blow up the planet he inhabits by pulling in meteors, he can be seen kicking your ass as the hardest boss of the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> multiverse. You know you’re about to have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-final-bosses-in-video-game-history-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bad time whenever this guy shows up.</a></p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Doomsday (Death Of Superman, Batman V Superman)</h2> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="830" data-injectable="true">Doomsday only has the ability to grow a natural defense against whatever you throw at him. Shoot him once, and he’ll get hurt and pissed off. Shoot him a second time, and he’ll only get pissed off. That’s pretty scary as is, but we learn that by the time we first see him, Doomsday has already been subject to countless years of violent experiments. He’s the only creature in fiction who was ever able to kill Superman, and he didn’t need to buy a single Kryptonite knife from Amazon to achieve that.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">4. Femto (Berserk)</h2> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">Femto is the result of a deal that saw the mercenary Griffith reborn as a member of the fearsome Godhand. Femto is incredibly strong and can warp reality, but that’s not even the worst of it. The problem is that he cannot even be harmed by any known means. Anything you throw at him that would pose any sort of threat just goes through him as if he were a ghost. Going up against Femto is like fighting a cheater who has god mode and noclip on.</p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Even before he was Femto, Griffith was the biggest backstabber in the history of art. The only thing in life worse than being betrayed by the person you love is seeing them then turn into a quantically immortal being of pure evil, which is what the hero of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk/">Berserk</a></em> also has to deal with.</p>  <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Harbinger (Mass Effect)</h2> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">Whereas the Borg from <em>Star Trek </em>will assimilate humans into their hive mind, the Reapers from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a></em> just melt people into goo and use them as building materials. </p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">They’re the scariest alien fleet you can have invading your planet because they’re the most technologically advanced civilization in their universe. Harbinger, first introduced in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, seems to be their leader. Whereas the other villains on this list are only confined to one planet (at a time, at least), Harbinger’s goons can get you wherever you are.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Cyberdreams</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. AM (I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream)</h2> <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">The Allied Mastercomputer, AM, from Harlan Ellison’s masterpiece short story and the video game of the same name, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/i-have-no-mouth-but-i-must-tell-you-about-this-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream</a></em>, is not only one of the most powerful villains in fiction, it’s also undisputedly one of the most vile. </p>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">AM is an AI made by the best minds in its world solely to find ways to hurt humans, and that’s exactly what he’s done for untold millennia when the story is set. After he takes over the planet Earth, AM is indestructible, relentless, and able to torture and kill with great efficacy. Still, the worst part is how he’s also able to heal and make his victims immortal, allowing him to torture them forever.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="The Thing | The Blood Test" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2o2FRwn_hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">1. The Thing (John Carpenter’s The Thing)</h2> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">When I said that <em>The Thing </em>is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-horror-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the scariest Sci-Fi Horror movie of all time</a>, I wasn’t joking. The titular Thing is an intelligent organism with the ability to consume and replace any organic or inorganic material in existence. Sure, it can bite your head off, but it can just as well kill, eat, and replace all your loved ones before it does the same to you. </p>
 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">It only needs one functioning cell to consume an entire planet, and it’s smart enough to build spaceships to visit other planets when it’s done with yours. You might be able to defeat <em>The Thing</em>, but you’ll never have the mental strength to shake off the paranoia that will forever haunt your every thought whenever you talk to another person or, even worse, try to pet a cute dog.</p>

            <p>The live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda is being developed in "as closest possible collaboration" with the "true genius" of Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/tom-rothman-streaming-audiences-quentin-tarantino-1235920644/">Deadline</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/legend-of-zelda-movie-shigeru-miyamoto-close-collaboration-involvement/">The Gamer</a>, Sony Motion Pictures Group chair Tom Rothman stressed the importance of "big IP movies" for the company, asserting that "The Legend of Zelda is going to be huge for us".</p>

<p>"He’s a true genius in that world, and it’s really his strong vision that is motivating it," Rothman said of Miyamoto. "He created it and understands it thoroughly. You only [have] to look at the results of Super Mario Brothers to see.</p>
<p>"Big IP movies are going to stay big. The Legend of Zelda is going to be huge for us. Massive."</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie at the end of last year</a>. Details are sparse at present, but Miyamoto, announcing the news on Nintendo Japan's Twitter/X account, said the project has already been in development for "many years now".</p>
<p>As per an accompanying press release, Miyamoto will produce the movie - which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution) - with Avi Arad, responsible for "many hit films", also producing.</p>
<p>As Tom explained for us at the time, Arad's films are primarily (but not exclusively) within the superhero genre, ranging from the acclaimed Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and its celebrated 2018 predecessor, to 2022's Tom-Holland-starring Uncharted adaptation, as well as the likes of Venom, Morbius, the live-action Ghost in the Shell, and next year's Borderlands movie.</p>
<p>Wes Ball, the director of Nintendo's upcoming The Legend of Zelda movie, has discussed some of his ambitions for the project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-director-wants-it-to-be-like-a-live-action-miyazaki">saying he "would love to see a live-action Miyazaki"</a> - a reference to legendary Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki, whose animated work includes Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Laputa: Castle in the Sky.</p>
<p>Did you know that an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/check-out-this-pitch-trailer-for-a-cg-legend-of-zelda-movie-that-was-never-made">animated movie almost brought Hyrule to life back in 2007</a>? Ten years ago now, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/08/04/see-the-trailer-for-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-that-never-was">Forbes</a> shared a concept trailer for a CG Legend of Zelda movie. Created by Netflix's The Sea Beast's Adam Holmes, it shows Link sweeping in to save Princess Zelda from a gaggle of evil Bokoblins.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-fantasia-lalafell-doors/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=final-fantasy-xiv-fantasia-lalafell-doors</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv%E2%80%99s-updated-fantasia-will-finally-unlock-doors-to-lalafell-only-buildings.875130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-fantasia-lalafell-doors/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=final-fantasy-xiv-fantasia-lalafell-doors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Anybody who has ever played even a small part of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> will know that it’s a gargantuan game. With over 300 hours of MSQ alone, not including any side content, there’s always something to do or discover. Worthwhile side quests, new people to meet, and even some secrets.</p> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">With almost 7,000 hours sunk into my own Eorzean adventure, I thought I’d found most of the secrets in the world. I labored under the illusion that I’d found all of the secret locations, interesting characters, and fun quirks of the world. However, one user on Reddit has proven me wrong, and I am now humbled. I’m also wondering what else might have escaped my attention, but that’s another story.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="132" data-injectable="false">According to this Reddit post, there are buildings in Kholusia that can only be accessed by those who play <em>FFXIV </em>as Lalafells.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Now, I’ve dabbled in playing as a Lalafell. I have an alt character who has, in the past, battled through <em>A Realm Reborn</em> in her tiny little shoes. However, I never made it to <em>Heavensward</em> on that character, let alone <em>Shadowbringers</em>, so I could be forgiven for not knowing about this secret, right? Wrong.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">If you approach these buildings as any other race, something I was fairly confident I must have done at some point in the past, then a written prompt appears very blatantly on the screen saying, “This area can only be accessed by Lalafells.” How could I have missed that? How many secrets am I missing because I haven’t tried running up to random small doors?&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">The main point of this Reddit post by u/DrForester wasn’t to draw attention to the secret itself, though many in the comments were as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1cuzw7a/comment/l4m35rw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">dumbfounded by the revelation</a> as I was. It was to highlight a use for the upcoming changes to Fantasia and the new 60-minute window of opportunity it provides. I mean, think about it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Everyone is about to get a free phial of Fantasia, which will give us 60 minutes to transform into a Lalafell, head to Tomra, and investigate what we’ve been missing all this time (spoiler: according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyjZ8XRejFo">this video</a>, we’re not missing much) before heading back into Character Creation to turn back into our usual selves. Honestly, it’s a genius idea, when you think about it.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">I have to ask, though… Why do only Lalafells get a secret, exclusive area just for them to enter? Is there a secret Miqo’te meeting room I don’t know about? Or maybe a Hrothgar headquarters that never gets spoken about? If not, perhaps there should be. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have random buildings to try and enter.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s true to say that, throughout your adventure across Eorzea, you’ll meet a lot of memorable characters in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. Some of them leave more of a mark than others, but that’s not to say that each character isn’t meaningful in their own right.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">I have to admit, narrowing this list down to just 10 characters was tough. Even when I thought I’d reached a final list, someone else would pop into my mind, and I found myself second-guessing my choices a lot. However, after a lot of soul-searching, I’ve managed to come up with a <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> top 10 that represents some of my favorite moments, arcs, and themes from over a decade’s worth of storytelling. </p>
 <h2 id="h-10-gigi" data-injectable="false">10.

He later goes on to adopt Gigi as a ward, at the suggestion of Edmont de Fortemps, to protect him from those who would do him harm. Essentially, Hildibrand Manderville has a Mammet son. &nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">But not for long, after journeying out on an adventure to locate his Grandfather, Godbert, the Mammet gets stuck in the snow and freezes, only to be found by Godbert and turned into a Roegadyn temporarily. It’s just long enough to almost squeeze his father, Hildibrand, to death, though.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">Honestly, Gigi makes this list because no other part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-begin-ffxiv-hildibrand-quest-arr-hw-sb-endwalker/">Hildibrand storyline</a> has made me laugh harder or warmed my heart more. This little Mammet, familiar to anyone who has played <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, leaves his mark on your heart as well as one of the walls in Idyllshire.</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-dulia-chai-mewlah" data-injectable="false">9. Dulia-Chai Mewlah</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">Dulia-Chai is the Miqote mother figure we all need in our lives. After Alphinaud finally gains access to Eulmore under the guise of being there to paint a portrait for her and her husband, Chai-Nuzz, he’s all but adopted by the woman who pours love into their relationship.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false">Without missing a beat, she encourages Alphinaud with his painting, and the two bond, leading to a very tearful farewell when it’s time for Alphinaud to leave Eulmore. Dulia-Chai is also the face of progress in Eulmore after Vauthry’s defeat, despite knowing they’d been complicit in allowing him to wreak havoc.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">She also has a very motherly line which everyone needs to hear from time to time:</p>
 <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="115" data-injectable="false">“No matter where you are, remember that there are people here who are praying for your health and happiness”.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-8-alpha" data-injectable="false">8. Alpha</h2> <figure data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Originally created by Omega to battle strong foes, Alpha failed to live up to Omega’s expectations. The otherworldly weapon wiped Alpha’s memories and used him to draw mortals into the Interdimensional Rift. Alpha inadvertently draws the WoL and the Garlond Ironworks team into the Rift, where Omega is hoping to observe them fighting powerful enemies.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">Upon coming to understand his true purpose and being dismissed by Omega, Alpha doesn’t despair. He chooses to stay at the side of the Warrior of Light, helping in their battle against the rift’s powerful enemies. As the raid series ends, Alpha is given the freedom to roam Eorzea, and occasionally, if you’re lucky, you can still see him on his adventures in the open world. </p>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">Alpha also helps during <em>Endwalker </em>when he visits Sharlayan to help finalize the Ragnarok, allowing the WoL to venture to the Edge of the Universe.</p> <h2 id="h-7-raubahn-aldynn" data-injectable="false">7. Raubahn Aldynn&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Raubahn was arrested in Ul’dah on suspicion of espionage at the age of 25, after fleeing from the sudden Garlean invasion of his homelands. He was sentenced to fight in the Coliseum or “Bloodsands”, as it’s otherwise known. At some point, he was pardoned on a whim by Nanamo Ul Namo and won his freedom and the people’s respect.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="710" data-injectable="true">After winning his freedom, he met a young Lalafell called Pippin, who had been sold into slavery to pay off his father’s debts. Using his winnings to pay for the boy’s emancipation from his family, Raubahn went on to adopt the Pipin and then, further down the line, purchased the Coliseum itself and earned himself a place on the Syndicate of Ul’dah.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Raubahn is unflinchingly loyal to Nanamo Ul Namo, even losing his left arm in his duty to protect her, and is solely responsible for reorganising Ul’dah’s military to form the Immortal Flames. If that doesn’t earn him a place on this list then I don’t know what does. He’s just an all-round good guy if you ask me.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-6-feo-ul" data-injectable="false">6. Feo Ul</h2> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">I honestly never thought I’d be able to say that a fairy would be among my favorite characters in a <em>Final Fantasy </em>game, but this is where I’ve ended up.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">Feo Ul is the first Fae we meet during our time on The First and is originally intended to help us forge a connection with The Source in order to access retainers and convey messages. However, you soon come to realise that Feo Ul is incredibly possessive of the WoL, calling you their “precious sapling”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Eventually, Feo Ul willingly takes the title of King of the Faeries in order to protect the WoL from having to do it, stating that they will always be able to help the WoL in times of great need. During the final battle with Vauthry, Feo Ul comes to the rescue of the Scions, allowing them to forge ahead and finish the fight.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-5-counselingway" data-injectable="false">5. Counselingway</h2> <figure data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Having given into despair when her main purpose in life is stripped away from her, Counselingway is pretty hard to reach at first. She’s depressed, longing for purpose, and unsure what she should do with her life. Then, Livingway, Dreamingway and the rest of the Loporrit’s set up a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-endwalker-tribal-alliance-guide-how-to-get-the-lop-hop-emote-and-other-rewards/">radio station</a> to help her communicate with the people or Etheirys, the very people they were created to protect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">I’m sure I’m not alone in saying that Counselingway is, in some part, very familiar to all of us. We can all feel hopeless, lost, and unsure what to do with ourselves sometimes. But despite being hard to reach, she comes out of her shell and finds a love for something she never dreamed she’d be able to do.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="150" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">Counselingway offers lessons in friendship, perseverance, and never giving up. I love her story and I’m proud of her for how far she’s come.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-4-emet-selch" data-injectable="false">4. Emet-Selch</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true">Emet-Selch has what could be the most gut-wrenching arc in <em>Final Fantasy XIV. </em>He’s the Founder and first Emperor of the Garlean Empire, which he admits was created purely to invoke chaos and bring about another Calamity, he’s at least partly responsible for the summoning of Zodiark that required the aether of more than half of the Ascians to complete, and he’s boomeranged back and forth about whether the Scion’s are worthy of his allegiance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">However, despite all of this, Emet-Selch has an undeniable longing to do something good, lurking deep down from the person he was before. He retrieves Y’shtola after she uses Flow to escape in the Ronkan Temple, he rescues us from the Void simply by snapping his fingers, and at the very end of the main <em>Endwalker </em>story, after the final lonely ascension, he’s there beside us to lend us his strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-3-tataru-taru" data-injectable="false">3. Tataru Taru</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">There are very few characters in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> who deserve their ending (so far) more than Tataru Taru. While the rest of the Scions are off defending the world and experiencing calamities, Tataru has consistently held down the fort from the very beginning. While everyone else was on The First, she continued her duties at The Rising Stones, never has a bad word to say about anybody and, perhaps most importantly, she’s always helping us to expand our wardrobe.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">During <em>Endwalker</em>, Tataru has finally been able to live out her dream and opened up her own <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-6-55-tatarus-grand-endeavor-quest-guide/">clothing boutique</a>, offering her wares far and wide. She has organised provisions for countless important battles and if the WoL is ever uncertain about which direction they should head in, Tataru is always there to offer friendly advice and a new outfit.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">On top of all this, Tataru is responsible for us having our very own Island Sanctuary. I’m not really a fan of Island Sanctuary as a whole, but even I have to admit that Tataru has one hell of a business head on her small Lalafell shoulders. Now if only she could inspire the Mammets to be a little more helpful, I’d be grateful.</p>
 <h2 id="h-2-g-raha-tia" data-injectable="false">2. G’raha Tia</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">Hard working, unflinchingly loyal, and by our side no matter what happens, G’raha is the best friend we all need. This man has ‘died’ or sacrificed himself for the WoL more times than I care to remember, each time having made the WoL promise to continue the adventure and fight ever onwards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">G’raha partially fuses himself with the Crystal Tower to prolong his life, enabling him to be the guide he was destined to be as The First faces peril from the Flood of Light. Even after the WoL has helped to fend off the threat, G’raha becomes a member of the Scions and is there, regardless of circumstance, to help guide the way.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Above everything else, G’raha provides the most hard hitting quote from anyone in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, at least in my opinion:</p>
 <p data-characters="694" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true">“Yours is a long road, my friend, and it stretches on to places beyond imagining. With your every step, these grand adventures shall grow more distant and faint. And there may come a day when you forget the faces and voices of those you have met along the way. On that day, I bid you remember this… That no matter how far your journey may take you, you stand where you stand by virtue of the road you walked to get there. For in times of hardship, when you fear you cannot go on… The joy you have known, the pain you have felt, the prayers you have whispered and answered—they shall ever be your strength and your comfort. This I hope—I believe, here at memory’s end.”</p>
 <h2 id="h-1-ardbert-hylfyst" data-injectable="false">1. Ardbert Hylfyst</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true">Even though we first meet Ardbert during <em>Heavensward</em>, he doesn’t come into his own until <em>Shadowbringers</em>. The WoL is the only person who can hear Ardbert upon arriving on The First, and he quickly becomes the WoLs comfort in times of pain and hardship. In the end, Ardbert and the WoL are revealed to be two halves of one sundered soul – soulmates, if you will.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">He’s not the most sunshine-and-roses type of guy when we first meet him, but he slowly regains his sense of hope after shadowing us through the story of <em>Shadowbringers</em>. Towards the end of <em>Shadowbringers</em>, Ardbert merges his soul with the WoL in order to contain the Light. At the end of the main <em>Endwalker </em>story arc, his is the first and last voice you hear upon ascending the final hill alone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">“If you need a push, I’ll be right there behind you … Let’s finish this.” I get goosebumps just thinking about it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">I’ve played through <em>Shadowbringers </em>multiple times, as I have the rest of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, and Ardbert’s story is the one that’s guaranteed to reduce me to an ugly crying mess very quickly. It’s the story that I connected with the most and stayed with me most consistently, so that’s why he’s always going to be my favorite character.</p>

            <p>FromSoft has dropped a new tease about the "fearsome foes of unfathomable power" that await us when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree drops next month.</p>
<p>The image – which is about as hard to describe as the creature will inevitably be to beat – shows a muscular being with horned, uh, tendril things, a cracked golden mask for a face, and long grey hair flowing out of its right eye socket.</p>

<p>The face is particularly intriguing, as gold seems to be a key theme of Shadow of the Erdtree, and is seen pouring out of the large Erdtree in the main artwork, as well as in new spells. As Ed speculated earlier this week, we've been wondering if this may link to Miquella's Unalloyed Gold.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://x.com/PloybertCorti/status/1791550102781231596">others</a> have likened it to a woman's reproductive system, so make of that what you will.</p> <div>

<p>This latest tease follows last week's uncovering of "the abandoned and tragic who forage beneath the umbra pray for the embrace of a new master", which gave us another peek at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reveals-new-elden-ring-enemy-with-bloodborne-esque-design">new Elden Ring enemy with a glowing, bulbous head</a>.</p>
<p>The much-anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree releases on 21st June and is set to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">FromSoftware's largest expansion to date</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-five-year-journey-to-make-an-adventure-game-out-of-ink-and-paper.875100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24155754/the-collage-atlas-interview-steam-hand-drawn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I couldn’t walk away from the pen and ink thing,” says John Evelyn, creator of <em>The Collage Atlas</em>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2581960%2FThe_Collage_Atlas%2F">a dreamlike storybook adventure recently released on Steam</a>. The entire game is hand drawn, from tiny flowers and insects to huge buildings and the clouds that float over them. Exploring this world unwraps its dreamlike story, with environments folding out in response to your approach.</p><p>“I had been drawing for many years before that […] and I’d always draw with ink straight away, without any kind of prior pencil work or sketching,” he says. “I liked all the incidental details and the accidents that come out along the way.” He compares it to improv music — “actually, sometimes it goes horribly wrong!” — but says that the feeling of getting into a stride and being surprised by unexpected outcomes was important to the whole game.</p><p>It’s because of this that the art style underpins the rest of the experience. Where individual pieces of game art can fall into the background, <em>The Collage Atlas</em> requests your attention to detail — and rewards it. At the very start of the game, a pinwheel appears from a grassy plain; look at it, and it begins spinning. It was one of the first things that Evelyn created, for what was originally an app meant to accompany a picture book.</p><p>The book, a follow-up to a self-published work called <em>Asleep As The Breeze</em>, was intended to explore themes of agency and the feeling of disempowerment that can come from traumatic or chaotic life experiences. “You can start to feel like life is something that’s kind of happening to you rather than something that you have meaningful control or authorship of,” says Evelyn.</p><p>While experimenting with that theme, “everything clicked into place,” when the pinwheel spun, he says. “It suddenly made sense that, actually, this was the crux of what I was trying to talk about. That, actually, even when it doesn’t feel like it, just your presence within the world is genuinely meaningful and actually does have an impact on it. Even your gaze and your observation is also meaningful.”</p><div><p>“Even your gaze and your observation is also meaningful.”</p></div><p>Evelyn built on the app idea for a short art experience, which he exhibited at the Leftfield Collection at UK gaming convention EGX in 2016. At the time, he says, he had no intention of continuing to expand it into a game that would eventually make it to Apple Arcade and then Steam. Instead, he says, it was “something that I personally felt like I really needed to do.”</p><p>“I had gone through a pretty bad run of years,” he says, “and I was finding it difficult to find media that spoke to me about the things I was experiencing.” Other media seemed deeply specific to others’ situations, whereas Evelyn wanted something broader. “Things that just nudge at universal themes I find really useful.”</p><p>At the show, people connected with his piece. In particular, Evelyn was swayed by the attention of “business-type people,” who would ask him how long the full game would end up being. “In my mind, I was like, ‘Oh, do you actually think that people would want that?’” He says he was swayed by them because, if they were coming at it from a “fairly cold financial standpoint” and thought there would be an audience for it, he might be able to believe it himself.</p><div><p><cite>Image: John William Evelyn</cite></p></div><p>He knew that he wanted the experience to be something that could “slowly absorb you” — meaning a couple of hours, rather than 10 minutes. For the next four years, he threw everything at filling out that scope. Although he had experience and knowledge from a career that included time making Flash games, working in freelance illustration, and releasing music EPs, he also had a lot to learn. “The day that I started <em>The Collage Atlas</em> as it is now, not the little demo version, that was the very first day I opened up [game engine] Unity,” he says.</p><p>In order to convert illustrations to 3D, a process he had never done before, he began by creating the models in Unity before printing their maps and drawing in the details with pen. Once scanned back in, those textures were readded to the model to create the world of <em>The Collage Atlas</em> and everything that makes it up.</p><div><p>“Works don’t have any kind of permanence — they can just vanish.”</p></div><p>After nearly five years of work, in 2020, the game was released on Apple Arcade, but in 2023 it was delisted when the exclusivity period ended. Not long afterward, even people who had downloaded it weren’t able to launch it. “This is the sad thing about the way our kind of creative mediums are going: works don’t have any kind of permanence — they can just vanish,” he says. Evelyn felt he owed it to his past self who did all that work to make sure the game was still available and recently launched it on Steam.</p><p>After the game’s Apple Arcade release, Evelyn thought he might be done working on games. “I spoke to one of my friends who’s a AAA developer and I said, ‘That’s it. That’s me done. I’m never doing this again.’ He said, ‘I’ll give you six months.’” Almost exactly six months later, he started working on his next game, <em>The Wings of Sycamore</em>. Also hand-drawn, it’s something of a spiritual sequel to <em>The Collage Atlas</em>.</p><p>“<em>Atlas</em> is trying to explore the idea of falling inwards,” he says. “<em>Wings of Sycamore</em> is about flight. After you manage to climb back out of the depths, hopefully, that’s when you just have the pure joy of flying.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series</a> — and millions of newcomers — with meticulously sprawling political plots, complicated characters, and even a whodunnit. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/25/18638407/best-episodes-list-seasons">Abruptly axing Ned Stark</a> in the penultimate episode made the game of <em>Game of Thrones</em> clearer than ever: You win. Or you die. </p>
<p id="xZwX8N">Into season 2, Benioff and Weiss wielded the bombastic stakes set down by the books. In Martin’s world, no fantasy trope was ever neat, and it was rarely simple. The beautiful girl noticed by the prince found herself in a horror story; the boy king was either malevolent or misguided, with no Merlin to bail him out. <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ inversions grew like vines, constantly spreading and weaving together to more and more complicated patterns. Success was debatable — even fans questioned the nuance of the Lannisters, or the fraught sexposition that the show often employed for exposition-heavy scenes — but the tendrils of the HBO show made it flush and sturdy, even if things in Meereen floundered a bit. </p>
<p id="7Wo91K">Still, it’s no wonder that the second the roots of <em>Game of Thrones </em>felt too overgrown, people turned on it. Frustrated fans waited years (or decades, for book stans) for a fitting conclusion to what felt like <em>the</em> modern epic. After all the unflinching gambles, with so many threads to pull at, a truncated season 8 was never going to tie everything together with a neat bow.<strong> </strong>Viewers issued every kind of complaint after the finale aired on May 19, 2019, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/5/18/18627983/game-of-thrones-season-8-petition-rewrite-star-wars">a petition to reshoot the whole final season</a> all together. Then culture just kind of shuffled along. <em>Game of Thrones</em> became another major tentpole that, in its best days, felt like a true marriage of culture and commerce, and suddenly no one <em>really</em> wanted to talk about anymore. </p>
<p id="3jf5k5">But the industry did; before the show was even over, producers were already looking for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/5/21/18634070/new-game-of-thrones-show-witcher-lord-of-the-rings-tv-star-wars-series">“the next <em>Game of Thrones</em>.”</a> The folly of that search for monoculture in the streaming era isn’t even the true legacy of the series; whether you liked it or not, <em>Thrones</em> is the skeleton key to the next era of TV, according to those living it. Five years after the finale, Polygon reached out to a handful of showrunners and directors to understand the <em>Game of Thrones</em> ripple effect, and how they feel the industry might still  be learning from it.  </p>

<h2 id="DYjnL0"><strong>What drew us in</strong></h2>
<h4 id="FHUAc8">
<strong>Matt Shakman (director on </strong><em><strong>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, WandaVision, The Great</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="XzmVT1">That show changed everyone’s idea of what TV could do. </p>
<p id="T24tK6">Before I went to work on that show, I sat down with David Nutter — who is a wonderful filmmaker who had done the Red Wedding and many episodes — and he said, “You’re about to get the keys to the best Porsche that’s ever been built. And all they want you to do is put your pedal to the metal.” And it was this sense of: you have a huge playground, go have fun, and dream big and they’ll be there to support you. And that certainly had not been the experience in TV before, where things were done quickly, where you were sort of cutting corners, and that movie scope of what <em>Game of Thrones</em> was bringing hadn’t been done before. And now I think there’s an opportunity at so many places.</p>
<h4 id="cxqq5Z">
<strong>Naren Shankar (co-showrunner of </strong><em><strong>The Expanse, Almost Human</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="ysL0hp">I came to <em>Game of Thrones</em> only through the show, I’d never read the book. And so literally every step of the way, every moment of the show, the shocks hit me like big shocks. Literally up to the moment when the ax fell on Ned Stark’s neck, I was like, <em>There’s no way he can die</em>. And then the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24133430/fallout-wedding-scene-bloody-red-wedding-trope-history">Red Wedding</a> — that probably fucked me up for, like, weeks; “The Mountain and the Viper,” same thing. I was so<em> disturbed</em> by it. And that’s the real power of the show. I had never seen anything like that. Shows had kind of walked up to it a little bit, but I don’t think anything hit or had the impact of that. </p>
<h4 id="e9lpG8">
<strong>Halley Feiffer (showrunner of </strong><em><strong>American Horror Story: Delicate</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="YDOHj4">I think I didn’t trust <em>Game of Thrones</em> at first without watching it because it was so universally beloved. I often feel like such an outlier that I assume I will not fall in love with the thing that everyone else does — and then almost always I find that I do, only now I’m just behind the eight ball. And my experience with <em>Game of Thrones</em> was: I kept meaning to get around to it. [But] I was in LA with my friend Pedro Pascal, and he said, “I have to tell you something. I just booked a role on <em>Game of Thrones,” </em>and I was like, “Shit now I have to start watching <em>Game of Thrones</em>!” </p>

<p id="Vf3G90">And then, of course, fell in love with it, for all the reasons I didn’t think I would. I loved fantasy as a kid (because humanity’s unbearable). And what I loved about <em>Game of Thrones</em> was, how amidst the fantasy, how real these characters were, and how surprisingly relatable their emotional arcs were, even in a fantastical atmosphere. And how incredibly moving the performances were. </p>

</h4>
<p id="gnzTU6">At the end of the first season, it was clear that it was going to be a major television show. Whether it was successful or not, I just kind of knew this was something really different, and something that was going to change the way that, in particular, fantasy was done on TV — which, up until that point, had not had a lot of success in television. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/year-of-the-ring">The Lord of the Rings films</a> had broken box office records and were huge. But there hadn’t been a lot of fantasy on television that had actually gotten any traction. And so I knew kind of right away, this was something that was going to change that genre, pretty much permanently, for television going forward. </p>

<strong>Rafe Judkins (showrunner of </strong><em><strong>The Wheel of Time</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="fq2rUI">I have a special experience with <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because one of my dearest friends in the world was a writer on it from season 1 — Bryan Cogman. And I also was a huge, huge fan of the books before the series was ever made. So it was interesting to see the moments in the show where even I was like, <em>Oh my God, this I wish it was the same as it was in the books</em>. Because you begin to realize that I think that there’s a part of you, if you do love a book series, that no matter how it’s being adapted, and no matter who it’s being adapted by, there is a small death involved, the death of how you read it and how you saw it in your mind, and how you experienced it and who was the star of the books when you read it. </p>
<h4 id="juG20d">
<strong>Rachel Kondo (co-creator of </strong><em><strong>Shōgun</strong></em><strong>) </strong>
</h4>
<p id="techG3">[<em>Thrones</em>] was my first experience with thinking outside the world of a show, and just being abundantly curious — I hadn’t read the book. And I didn’t know much about adaptation when it came to book-to-screen. So this is the first one that I had ever watched, like, behind-the-scenes things afterwards, and listened to the creators, and it was just many firsts for me. I hadn’t thought about those things before. </p>
<p id="lFp88d">We looked forward to our Sunday nights religiously; we were faithful for years and years to watch in that way. And I feel like <em>Shōgun</em> — I kind of took it for granted they were releasing it on a weekly basis in that old style. But the fact that so many people have told me — from every walk of life — <em>We’re going to miss our Tuesday nights with </em>Shōgun; it reminded me of why we so miss <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It just felt like it had kind of worked its way, wormed its way into our hearts and lives. It worked into the logistics of our lives; we planned around it.</p>
<h4 id="d92Qv5">
<strong>Justin Marks (co-creator of </strong><em><strong>Shōgun</strong></em><strong>) </strong>
</h4>
<p id="aNCS6c">I think that it created for itself an event; we didn’t want to miss it. Any movie or show that I was working on when <em>Game of Thrones</em> was out, that was Monday’s discussion. We would sit there and talk about that episode and what had come out, and you best not miss it. And I think that it was so primed for that, and it made it so rich, to have that excitement to feel like it was an enduring world that we were witnessing in real time. And nothing does that anymore.</p>
<p id="76ROy7">I don’t think there’s anything quite like the feeling I got during the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/3/8724839/game-of-thrones-hard-home">“Hardhome” sequence</a> of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It wasn’t the action — I mean, sure, that was wonderful and scary and interesting, and the score so endured in my head, too. It was the moment at the end where the Night King where he stands up as they’re as they’re riding out, and he looks back at Jon Snow after they’ve just endured such heavy losses to even survive what they were able to do, and he stares indifferently. I’ll never forget this: Watching as he gestures with his arms out, and the entire army is reanimated again. And it’s just, <em>This is what you’re up against when you’re coming up against death itself</em>. That has haunted me forever. It’s so silent, and so beautiful, and meditative. Show me something else on TV that’s come since that will equal that. I think it’s iconic. I watch it again, sometimes just to feel something the way that I felt that night when I watched it.</p>

</h4>
<p id="2tbJRG">I’m friends with those guys, and putting aside whatever anyone thinks about season 8, I still think <em>Game of Thrones</em> is one of the greatest shows that’s ever been made. I think it completely changed the landscape of television. And it completely blew open the barn doors of what was possible — that you could tell a story over eight seasons, that you could tell a story that had 30 or 40 different characters, that it would be novelistic in its approach, that it would be a slow burn. And that’s the kind of show I like, those are the kinds of novels I like; so this adaptation of <em>Foundation</em> would not have been possible had that not happened. </p>
<h4 id="3DT3yA">
<strong>Karyn Kusama (director and executive producer on</strong><em><strong> Yellowjackets</strong></em><strong>, director on </strong><em><strong>Dead Ringers</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="x7BEFJ">It involved people in long-term conversations about the nature of power, and what that does to us. There have been other shows, completely unlike it, that also examine these themes, but for as much intrigue and kind of medieval soap as there was in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, there was also a long, slow burn toward really unpacking what I would call the derangement of power, like what becomes the derangement of oneself if you decide to claim power. </p>
<h2 id="rdSYxL"><strong>What kept us in the game</strong></h2>
<h4 id="KXb643"><strong>Halley Feiffer</strong></h4>
<p id="JR1zzI">It’s kind of the thing that I love in anything, whether it’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>, or this production of <em>Uncle Vanya</em> I saw last night, which is these moments between characters that feel both surprising and inevitable somehow, and the ways in which — especially in those first few seasons — these characters kept you on this tightrope between loving and loathing them. In one moment, you’re condemning their actions. And in the next moment, you’re hoping they commit more atrocities, if only to create this incredibly dynamic push pull within you, as it were, the way that it really kept you on your toes morally. That was something that I found incredibly exciting and complicated, and made me as a viewer feel implicated in the carnage in ways that felt very challenging, and almost impossible to recreate. But that means we want to keep coming back for more as a viewer, and I want to try to find my own version of that dramatic tension in my own work.</p>
<h4 id="R1aYbP"><strong>Rafe Judkins</strong></h4>
<p id="Crq9Em">I really loved Oberyn Martell in the show, and bringing that character in, and the way they adapted him and the way they brought him to the forefront even more so than he was in the books, let him really shine on the show and then exit in such a great moment. I felt like it was a really brilliant piece of adaptation because they contained the character really to one season where he could make the most impact, they devoted more screen time to him than you should to a character that’s going to die that season, and the devotion of that screen time really paid off. And I think it’s one of the most successful story arcs they had on the show. And I think that was in large part due to how they adapted it, and it was one that like you could see really lifted the story from the books into something even better for television.</p>
<p id="ecDWXJ">[And] the Red Wedding — I remember throwing the book to the floor, screaming, texting my mom, because I knew she was right around the same part of the book being like <em>What page are you on right now?</em> I remember that as being just this iconic moment in reading of the visceral, emotional reaction you had to it as a reader. And I think there was this interesting thing that happened with the show and an excellent work on the part of the adaptation, where the whole world had that response to the show. It’s a big part of why I think the show really took off, was that moment, and the creation of this visceral emotional response that sort of transcends the experience of watching television.</p>
<h4 id="GOdaPV"><strong>Justin Marks</strong></h4>
<p id="9vPVRo">There was a real feeling of confidence to the <em>Game of Thrones</em> narrative that was always at odds, in some sense, with what the audience expected and wanted, and I think that was really bold. The fact that all of us feel so free to loudly agree or disagree with the direction that the story would go at various times speaks to the quality of the narrative. After you’re out of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, I think you have to go back to <em>The Sopranos</em> to find a show that was as good at what <em>Game of Thrones</em> was. It never felt like once it got you addicted to one pace that it was going to stay on that pace. It was always willing to sort of flash us the middle finger and use that expectation against us sometimes. I feel like <em>Game of Thrones</em> did a wonderful job of saying: You don’t deserve anything other than what we offer you. You’re just kind of putty in our hands. And I think that’s what was so great, it was taking from the David Chase school of <em>I’m in control</em> that made a difference for me.</p>
<p id="adWqz9">The horizontality of the storytelling was really powerful to me. It went backwards to events that the show never deigned to ever show us. And whatever you want to call it — sexposition, horse-position, there was a lot of different versions of it in the show — it was handled in this way that ran at odds with what our expectations were sometimes for how stories should be told, and shown and not told. But it gave it a richness that made me feel like all of it was alive and rewarded multiple viewings. I remember with the Hound and the Mountain, how much they were sort of spoken about long before they’re ever together. And it’s like: look, you can engage that or not engage it, but it’s <em>there</em>, and it’s waiting for you. It becomes like some Dickens-like scale to the narrative and the world that just felt so alive. </p>
<h4 id="gchjMl"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></h4>
<p id="F1bila">It was the scope of it and the size of the production, how many characters and storylines there were, how well mounted it was in a production sense. It was visually arresting, and you really felt the world, right. It wasn’t just over in this one little kingdom over here doing a story, it had a very broad scope to the world. And it was a sweep, an epic sweep to the story that was really astonishing. </p>
<p id="KueEF2">I’m sure everybody talks about this, but: the moment they killed Ned... it was jaw dropping. I tend to watch TV with part of my brain thinking about the writing of it, the structure, and how they did this and that — and I didn’t see that coming in at all. Because you walk into the show, believing Sean Bean is the lead. If he’s gonna die, it’s gonna be the end of the season at best. But in the middle of the season like that, and the way they played that out it really was — I couldn’t really believe. And I was really impressed with just how bold that was in terms of storytelling.</p>

<p id="vvTn3j">It reminded me a lot of <em>Sopranos</em>, where there was a lot of things that the <em>Sopranos</em> characters did, the way they acted and the way the stories turned, that you just sort of went, <em>Well this is not how television is supposed to be, I can’t believe you’re gonna do that. I can’t believe you’re getting away with that</em>. And they both had a similar, just, kind of, bold quality, like: <em>Yeah, we’re gonna do it. And you know what, you’re gonna come back next week, and then watch it again</em>. </p>
<h4 id="QVUjlD"><strong>David Goyer</strong></h4>
<p id="ZGwrEh">Obviously, initially, for the first five seasons or so they had the books they were drafting off, but those characters just felt so much more three-dimensional to me than so many of the fantasy depictions I’d seen. My wife does not consider herself a fan of fantasy, but absolutely loved <em>Game of Thrones</em>. And so I think what’s important for us [as we work on <em>Foundation</em>] is that we really try to flesh out the interior lives of these characters. And as much as possible have the conflicts that they’re wrestling with feel universal, even though we’re dealing with the tropes of science fiction, and have the emotions and the dialogue not be laden down with too much sort of science fiction jargon. </p>

<p id="CaantW">I remember I had not read the Game of Thrones books, and a big science fiction/fantasy friend of mine; we would have dinner once a month, and he’d read all the books, and I think [I had] just finished the first season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> watching it. And he said, “You won’t think it now. But you will love Jaime Lannister.” And I said, <em>That’s just not possible! They just pushed this kid out of a window at the end of the first episode! there’s just no way that’s ever going to happen.</em> And he said, “I’m telling you, you’re wrong.” And I did love him; the guy’s involved in this incestuous relationship, and he, as far as he’s concerned, kills a child. And yet, by season 3, you fucking love the guy. And that was the best thing about <em>Game of Thrones</em> for me; you could take a character who you felt one way about, and slowly over the course of time, change the audience view. </p>
<h4 id="gjHCNX"><strong>Rachel Kondo</strong></h4>
<p id="Tiih71">It’s not outside of genre, it just transcends genre, right? It utilizes the best of what genre has and then finds a way to exist anew within it. How do you have spectacle but how do you sustain the care? It’s about surprise and inevitability, which the best stories really, really, really tried to strike that balance, or to achieve both at the same time. </p>
<p id="85q6yQ">You remember how you felt after [Battle of the Bastards], or Red Wedding — [<em>Shōgun</em>] didn’t quite have those moments. So for us, I would often think about those very very quiet interpersonal things on <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Like the moment Khaleesi gets Drogo to fall in love with her and look at her anew. You remember these things! And these very, very tiny moments. That’s what I was hoping we could somehow manufacture were these relationship moments you can’t forget just like you wouldn’t forget the battle scenes. </p>
<h4 id="z1MiuM"><strong>Matt Shakman</strong></h4>
<p id="0WIZut">The thing that <em>Game of Thrones</em> did do, and that we’re trying to do on <em>Monarch</em>, and I think all these shows that are succeeding on doing epic storytelling, is rooting it in character. It’s all about rooting for these characters, hoping they’ll survive, being curious where they’ll go. </p>
<h4 id="3SXAsk"><strong>Naren Shankar</strong></h4>
<p id="6dV7UU">I think more than anything — both as a viewer and as a writer, and someone who makes these shows — what <em>Game of Thrones</em> does so well is it blew up these tried and true dramatic concepts, where your protagonist essentially had plot armor; no matter how bad it was, you kind of knew they were going to get out of it, you kind of knew that, you know, good would triumph in the end. All of that kind of stuff that had, I think, just woven itself in the fabric of so many shows, the good guys win. And that was not always the case with <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I think shows talk about being the next <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but they don’t seem to want to quite embrace that same idea. And that, I think, is what still distinguishes the show. It has a fairly ruthless and remorseless harshness in some ways, but it’s all in the service of staying true to character and narrative reality that very few things really pull off. You’re taken into it with an understandable lens. And so you’re drawn into it gradually, and things expand. </p>

<p id="1WZ21A">Now, the show gets incredibly complex quite quickly. But because you’re grounded that way, in the first season, you’re really with it, and so you’ve earned the right to sort of spread out. A common problem in a lot of big fantasy is you introduce so many characters, so many different locations, so many different storylines simultaneously, it’s hard to get grounded in these realities. And I don’t think <em>Game of Thrones</em> had that problem at all. I think you’re just so with the Starks and Winterfell and their journey out into the world it was very easy to engage, even for people who, you know, aren’t like real, hardcore fantasy people.</p>
<h2 id="iki14k"><strong>How Game of Thrones influenced other shows (including their own)</strong></h2>
<h4 id="op5Oo6"><strong>Matt Shakman</strong></h4>
<p id="DxiQu6">The scope grew over the seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I think it’s easy to forget, but they did whole battles without showing you anything. [In] one episode, Peter Dinklage gets knocked unconscious before the battle starts, so that he wakes up when the battle’s over; they didn’t have the money to do the battle. But you cared about Peter Dinklage, and that’s how you figured out what had happened, from Tyrion’s point of view. And sometimes we do that, when we have to. But if you have characters you believe in and you love, then you’re excited to figure out the information with them.</p>
<h4 id="b34Y59">
<strong>Randall Einhorn (director and producer of</strong><em><strong> Abbott Elementary, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The Office</strong></em><strong>)</strong>
</h4>
<p id="pMRJ7O">The scope and the breadth of that story, taking place all over this <em>huge</em> geography and all these different civilizations, it’s just like, wow. It’s really nice when you find something like that movie; and each one of those is a movie — incredible! It’s really encouraging to think about the size of the stories you can tell, where you can go. It certainly made me look at things that are larger, [and] bigger concept, because they can exist on TV.</p>
<h4 id="Ph3R3E"><strong>Halley Feiffer</strong></h4>
<p id="w6sp8q">It never felt like spectacle for spectacle sake. Everything felt very rooted in character in a way that did make it feel timeless and universal. And that was something that whetted my appetite for that kind of storytelling as a viewer. And as a creator — I suddenly felt like I could, perhaps in my own way, dip my toe into spectacle, and violence and gore. And use that kind of visual storytelling to explore age old and systemic issues like misogyny, like oppression, like gaslighting in ways that I never had considered before.</p>
<h4 id="zkEVIs"><strong>Rafe Judkins</strong></h4>
<p id="YdHAFJ">There’s this character Lady Stoneheart, when Catelyn Stark comes back from the dead. And I was obsessed with this character, couldn’t wait to see her on TV, just live and die, step on my throat Lady Stoneheart. And then when she wasn’t in the show I was like, <em>Bryan!! How could you not do Lady Stoneheart?</em> And he explained it, and it is the correct decision that they made to not do it — because if they’re going to bring back one character from the dead it has to be the one that matters the most to the overall story of the series. And for me there was still like a small death in it, and sadness in it, and anger in it because I — even though I know it’s the right choice for the show — I’m still upset about it. So, watching the show was a very good experience for me, and understanding the fundamentals of how people who love the source material are going to react to it. And the fact that no matter what you do, you can’t actually make everyone happy. So what you have to do the most is treat the story with respect and do everything you can to bring it to the screen in the best way possible that honors what was there.</p>

<p id="gHiuI4">If we’re going to spend a lot of money on these big TV shows, one of the great things we can do is take audiences to new places. I actually thought the way they did King’s Landing on <em>Thrones</em> was really special, because it has — even more so than anyplace else in the show — this very unique use of color, and tone, and hair is different when you’re in King’s Landing than anywhere else. The costumes are different. The color grade of the scenes are different; everything feels sort of like Tuscan and Croatian, and sunkissed. And I think sort of using Dubrovnik as a jumping off point for what they built in the city overall was a really smart way to do it. I really use that as a touchpoint for worldbuilding in <em>Wheel of Time</em>. </p>
<p id="TUT47F">I think one of the reasons <em>Wheel of Time</em> has been able to stick around and succeed where a lot of fantasy shows that follow <em>Game of Thrones</em> haven’t is because we were never chasing <em>Game of Thrones. </em>The Wheel of Time [books] came out before the Game of Thrones books, and it’s a very different kind of show. I’m super thrilled that people were interested in making a fantasy show because of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. But it never had an intention of being the “next <em>Game of Thrones</em>.” I always said, even when pitching it, <em>Game of Thrones</em> was something that appealed to the whole world, and broke across genre lines. And the next show that does that won’t be another big fantasy show, necessarily. It’ll be something else that generates that visceral, emotional reaction in people. And that’s the thing that kind of lets you cross these lines and become more of an international pop cultural phenomenon, than just a television show.</p>
<h4 id="CWK3Fy"><strong>Naren Shankar</strong></h4>
<p id="384h5k">The thing that I definitely remember taking as a very distinct lesson from <em>Game of Thrones</em> was: in the first season, Ned’s execution is episode 9. And in the traditional TV framework, that’s your season finale. And what I really took from that was the importance of letting the audience mourn, and feel for such an incredibly important character. I don’t recall seeing that. It’s like, the ability to process that loss, and let your audience do that, I think was a really big deal. And I can’t remember many shows or any shows really off the top of my head that approached it that way. But I thought that was an incredibly smart choice. </p>

<h4 id="81HMRN"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></h4>
<p id="1dr1kF">I was intrigued by a lot of the maneuvering at King’s Landing and what was happening there and the sort of inside the castle politics of it all, and I liked that. I like the way that it played out, and that you were never sure who’s up and who’s down, that they were always willing to sort of do a reversal of fortune on your favorite character. And I just liked that, as a storyteller. It made me go, <em>Yeah, you know, that’s something to keep your eye on and think about when you’re constructing these kinds of shows. </em>And there were things, to be frank, that I didn’t want to do. I thought sometimes, it was cruel, and I didn’t like the cruelty of it as a storyteller. That’s just a personal preference; that’s not a comment on George, or the world. But there were times that I just, I kind of was put back by it’s just a little too cruel in terms of its treatment of its characters and the treatment of the audience. Sometimes, I love this character. And there seemed to be a circle of delight in making you suffer with him.</p>
<p id="t808yg">It definitely raised the bar in terms of audience expectation of what you could produce on television. And unfortunately, I think the rest of us have suffered since their budget was so big, and they had so many days to shoot these gigantic — I mean, the Battle of the Bastards, I can’t remember how much money they spent on it, and how many days, but it was like a month or something crazy to spend on that one episode. So, and the rest of us mere mortals can’t come close to that kind of money. But the audience doesn’t have those distinctions, right? They just go, <em>Well, I think it should look really great</em>. And so there’s an expectation that whatever you’re doing, should look as good and be as big as what they did on that show. So that’s kind of the downside of what they did to the rest of us. </p>
<h4 id="4UO7q8"><strong>Justin Marks</strong></h4>
<p id="GNOMYn">I think that the scale of a production carries with it a lot of legacy in the culture of our business. I think that, rightly or wrongly — probably both to be honest — when they say “<em>Game of Thrones</em>-esque” what they really mean is “expensive.” And some of that is true, you know, like dragons come by, but not at the beginning. Slowly they build to it in the way that a responsible show ought to. So that held a lot and then created a bit of an arms race, probably; minds who are not as engaged to the creative of our business might see it as a simple thing like that. I think the directors I speak to, the showrunners, the writers I speak to when we talk about how much we love <em>Game of Thrones</em>, we’re really talking about that sprawling scale of the narrative when you’re doing something<em> Game of Thrones-</em>esque.</p>
<h4 id="P3Vuvx"><strong>Karyn Kusama</strong></h4>
<p id="a8xFhU">David and Dan are friends, and I just so appreciate what they accomplished with it. I felt like they were learning as they went, too. And they had some big, huge story reversals that, in a way, predicted now, or created almost an unreasonable pressure to make so much story happen over season to season. (Goddamn them.) So, you know, I really, I think it’s a very, you know, very potent legacy that show. Just even the pressure to have big story events happen, that also managed to still be surprising — that’s an <em>incredibly</em> difficult thing to do. I think TV only gets one or two or three Ned Stark’s, and then you’re kinda like,<em> OK we see it coming</em>. So you really have to find new ways to be surprising. </p>

<h4 id="M4KT8g"><strong>Naren Shankar</strong></h4>
<p id="J1iSCv">I think television business often seems to take the wrong lessons. Because the show got so gigantic and so enormous in terms of its spectacle. For a while [there was] just this internalized lesson, <em>Oh, we’ve got to make everything that costs $25 million an episode </em>— do we? We don’t <em>really</em>, because the years of the show where people just kind of went crazy for it were not those years. You’re forced into these things, and people think that’s the answer. So you had all of these shows that were really ridiculous, big, crazy, high-budget things, because people think that’s the way to get people into the season. And it’s like: it really isn’t. The things that people mostly remember about <em>Game of Thrones </em>are — there’s a lot of two-handers in that show. There’s a lot of scenes where people just talk to each other; they’re incredibly riveting and amazing. </p>
<h4 id="UIhmDD"><strong>Halley Feiffer</strong></h4>
<p id="Nlv3Ok">It’s gone in two directions that I can see. The more obvious direction, as we’ve all kind of famously heard of what is perhaps an apocryphal story of Jeff Bezos rebranding Prime Video and sort of demanding, “Bring me <em>Game of Thrones</em>.” I fell in love with Amazon as a streaming service by watching <em>Transparent </em>and <em>Red Oaks</em> and these small character-driven gritty, grainy, darkly funny, very human stories. Now, of course, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153893/lord-rings-power-season-2-trailer-release-date-sauron">the tentpole show on Prime Video is <em>Lord of the Rings</em></a>. And so I think Bezos was incredibly successful in that regard. And I miss those shows; we have a show like <em>Fleabag</em>, for instance, that wins every single Emmy. And now Phoebe Waller-Bridge is doing Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and I’m sure she’ll do an amazing job with that. And I would love to see more shows like <em>Fleabag</em>, personally, from a mind like that. </p>
<p id="DFrfXF">At the same time, there’s also been this very exciting development of these smaller in scope, more character-driven shows that know they’ll never be the sort of spectacle like <em>Game of Thrones</em> and aren’t trying to be — shows like <em>Severance</em>, like <em>Baby Reindeer</em>, these shows that can have actually a very similar cultural footprint and impact and feel unmissable in terms of the cultural zeitgeist without leaning on extravagant set piece battles. We need both in our culture, but I think sometimes we can forget that we need both.</p>
<p id="aMecTQ">Something I really admire about the creators is they’ve been very open about what they wish they had done differently, and what they are aiming to do differently going forward. So they’ve been very open about the lack of representation in their writers room the first couple of seasons. And we’re still really pushing this ball up the hill in terms of letting more diverse leaders really have their shot at holding the reins of a show. And especially a show like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, which is so rooted in grand spectacle. That’s something I’m excited by, the steps that we’re taking, and also feel we have a long way to go in terms of inclusivity not only for its own sake but in terms of really finding diverse and dynamic storytelling that continues to surprise and satisfy us. </p>
<h4 id="1CP9Iy"><strong>Rafe Judkins</strong></h4>
<p id="cabUOA">I definitely think audiences are receiving this kind of complicated world-building really differently, post-<em>Game of Thrones</em>. Especially now that <em>Wheel</em> has been on for a few seasons, you have more conversations with your dental hygienist or my boyfriend’s mom — people who you wouldn’t expect would be getting into an unbelievably complicated world of high fantasy who are just like, <em>Yeah, I’ll give that a try</em> — <em>and oh, I really like it!</em> And that’s very different than the world before <em>Game of Thrones</em>, where a lot of people would just be like, <em>That’s not the kind of show I watch</em>, or <em>the kind of movie I watch</em>. I think now, people are willing to show up at <em>Dune</em> and give it a try. People are willing to show up to <em>Wheel of Time</em> and give it a try, even if they don’t know the property. Even if they aren’t huge fantasy people, they know that there might be a possibility that they’d like something like this. And I think that’s a real gift <em>Game of Thrones</em> gave to all the rest of the sci fi and fantasy and genre projects out there.</p>
<p id="XeaHa8">I think what’s interesting about <em>Game of Thrones</em> is that it changed what people were chasing in television for a minute; it changed the aspiration of television to something that is more cinematic in a lot of ways. And that doesn’t just affect shows like <em>Wheel of Time, The Witcher</em>, or <em>Shadow and Bone</em> and all the fantasy series that followed <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I think it also affects how we look at all series on TV right now — like, if you open up any show now, it’s much harder to tell from 10 seconds of screen time whether it’s a television show or a movie than it was 10 years ago. And I think a lot of that is due to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because the aspiration to make television shows look cinematic — whether that’s <em>Euphoria</em> or <em>Elite</em>, a Spanish series that’s on Netflix and at a very low budget point — the aspiration is still to make those things all look the same as you would if you were filming them for the cinema. That’s a big change that’s been wrought in television across the last 10 years. And it’s obviously not <em>just</em> from <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It’s also a lot about the availability of cameras, and how to build things that do look more cinematic, and higher budgets for TV shows, and less episodes per season. But: I think a lot of that is due to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and it changed the aspiration of TV shows to be more cinematic than they had been previously — <em>all</em> TV shows.</p>
<h4 id="0VUBfR"><strong>Justin Marks</strong></h4>
<p id="ZpxvwU">It just never felt like it was prepackaged. It’s just this feeling of something that felt like a work of art, you know, despite all of the commercial trappings that obviously you carried with it. And man, that comes along once in a lifetime. The way so much of it has bled into our culture, like great movie moments or things. Everyone knows what I’m talking about when I make that joke, because that’s how much it’s just bled into our culture and changed our culture. And I don’t mean our storytelling culture. I mean, just the culture at large — and that’s a legacy that <em>Seinfeld</em> carries, and <em>Friends, </em>and <em>Cheers</em>, and shows completely outside of genre. Those are the things that <em>Game of Thrones</em> latches onto. It’s not ‘cause of dragons or fantasies or all that. </p>
<h4 id="U7AvMf"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></h4>
<p id="FLDE5O">I think in terms of story, they definitely said, <em>you can do a really intricate plots with multiple characters, and the audience will follow along. </em>If it’s compelling, the audience will hang in there. Then the trick becomes: Can you get them to take that first step? I think that gives comfort to those of us — especially those who work in the genre field. When you’re pitching shows, when you’re developing shows, there’s always a lot of skepticism on the part of executives who are saying, <em>Well, but the audience will be confused, or they won’t follow along, and they don’t understand this world, and you need to explain it more. </em>Well, <em>Game of Thrones</em> didn’t really explain a lot. You just kind of had to go with it, and the audience was definitely willing to go with it. </p>
<p id="5UhZB4">It’s still the one everybody still talks about. People still go into networks, and quickly as a shorthand they’ll say: <em>You know, we’re still looking for our</em> Game of Thrones. It’s still sort of the high watermark of not just fantasy, but how big a show can truly be where it had penetrated pop culture, it was a worldwide success, it was the water cooler show when we still had water coolers to hang around. Just in terms of commercial and critical success — it won the Emmy how many times — everybody still looks to it as: we want something as big as that.</p>
<p id="8QOE26">I was one of the minority that liked the finale. I thought it worked, and I thought it was for the logical extension of our various things that they had set up. It does get that wrap. </p>
<p id="xiEzLb">But I don’t hear a lot of talk about the finale, to be honest. In my conversations — in writer’s rooms, or with executives, or just socially — they talk about how <em>I used to love this, </em>or <em>hated that</em>, or <em>sounds cool</em> or whatever. There’s not too much talk about the actual phenomenon whether people liked it or didn’t like it, at least in my experience. The show <em>is</em> bigger than that. And whenever people thought of the finale, for good or for bad, they talk about the show. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to several credible reports, Valve is developing a new game called Deadlock. Leaked screenshots from the ongoing Closed Alpha playtest have even been shared <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter/X</a> by content creator Gabe Follower.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Deadlock is a third-person hero shooter that draws inspiration from the likes of Overwatch, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/valorant-professionals-wanted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valorant</a>, and others. Valve reporter Tyler McVicker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that it has been in development since 2018 under the codename Citadel.</p>
<p>Matches are a 6v6 affair set on a large map with four lanes. Each lane has a so-called transit line that players can use to move quickly, thanks to a skyhook thing similar to BioShock Infinite's. The setting is completely original and mixes steampunk elements with fantasy.</p>
<p>In one of Gabe Follower's screenshots, we can also read about one of the heroes, Grey Talon. He's described as a hero capable of delivering long-range skill shots with his bow. Here's the in-game description:</p>
<p><em>A cunning predator, Grey Talon uses a combination of deadly accuracy, traps, and clever positioning to bring down the toughest opponents.</em></p>
<p>The screenshot shows him having four abilities, and it's likely this will be true for the other heroes as well. Of course, nobody knows exactly when Valve plans to unveil this game to the world in an official capacity. The same applies to a release date window, although the large playtest without much of an NDA might suggest it won't be long until more people can get their hands on Deadlock.</p>
<p>Until then, stay tuned on Wccftech to be updated on the latest news, leaks, and rumors.</p>

  <p id="vSMHrh"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em> continues Senua’s journey as she heads to the mythical island of Iceland. After the events of <em>Senua’s Sacrifice: Hellblade</em>, Senua is a lot more at peace with her Furies, but the world is still full of monsters both all-to-real and quasi-fantastical.</p>
<p id="xIs4Eb"><em>Hellblade 2 </em>is a deliberately-paced, brutal, extensively mo-capped, narrative-driven adventure that picks up a bit after <em>Senua’s Sacrifce</em>. It’s just as deeply rooted in psychology and psychosis as the first game, but the real star is the way Ninja Theory made use of Unreal Engine 5 to deliver one of this generation’s first real next-gen moments. “There’s nothing else quite like it,” is how we put it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5">in our preview</a> back in April.</p>

<p id="JqBuiK">If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an <strong>Incense</strong>, then quickly <strong>tap each Bounsweet </strong>to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Bounsweet you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help you identify which ones you may have already checked.</p>
<hr id="fCZXnK">
<h2 id="Rck3HW"><strong>What Community Day move does Bounsweet’s evolution learn?</strong></h2>
<p id="P33K1t">If you evolve Steenee into Tsareena between 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move <strong>High Jump Kick</strong>.</p>
<p id="pcrxXf">If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get High Jump Kick. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines">Elite TM</a> to get the move.</p>
<hr id="sJ5mE8">
<h2 id="PRBqBQ"><strong>How does Tsareena do in the meta?</strong></h2>
<p id="UnfEw0">In terms of PvE (raids and gyms), Tsareena is behind the usual powerful attackers like Kartana and most shadow and Mega starters (Mega Sceptile, Mega Venusaur, Shadow Venusaur, Shadow Torterra — you get the gist). However, it sits among Roserade and Chesnaught in terms of power. So if you usually use these two and don’t have the resources to invest into Megas, Legendaries, and Shadows, then Tsareena is worth having with <strong>Magical Leaf </strong>and <strong>Grass Knot</strong>.</p>
<p id="Ome1FM">While High Jump Kick will give Tsareena some range in PvP, it’s still likely not worth using outside of specialized cups and tournaments.</p>
<hr id="wsHYws">
<h2 id="rVGJO4"><strong>How do I make the most of Bounsweet Community Day?</strong></h2>
<p id="VP2Yku">The following bonuses will be active during Bounsweet Community Day:</p>
<ul>
<li id="IH0sir">
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> hatch distance for eggs placed into Incubators during the event</li>
<li id="ygtKvn">Doubled candy for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="IlHTnG">Doubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="PF2Fbg">Incense lasts three hours</li>
<li id="R4eQq7">Lure Modules lasts three hours</li>
<li id="Kt1oY9">Bounsweet special photobombs when taking snapshots</li>
<li id="3l86uP">One additional special trade</li>
<li id="QaoYEy">Stardust cost halved for trading</li>
</ul>
<p id="kOd6mO">That said, you should definitely put your eggs in Incubators and pop an Incense and try to nab some powerful Bounsweet.</p>
<p id="tLRqH5">If you can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids"><strong>Mega Evolve</strong></a> <strong>Venusaur, Sceptile, Groudon, or Abomasnow</strong>, you’ll score additional Bounsweet Candy per catch.</p>
<p id="mfZjRH">In addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Steenee raid, Bounsweet will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Bounsweet you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.</p>

            <p>Seablip is a pixel art pirate 'em up, which promises an open world to sail around, islands to visit, crews to hire, bounties to hunt, and minigames through which to uncover treasure and fish. It looks adorable and it's out in Early Access now.

<p>The bit that always interests me most in games like these is the crew management, because I like looking after little guys. The sailors in Seablip sound as if they have a fair amount going on: there's a finite number of them so you've an incentive to keep them alive and happy, and they each have skills and attributes that'll change as they go through fights.
</p>
<p>There seems to be quite a few pirate 'em ups that split the game into distinct activities, which I'm assuming is thanks to Sid Meier's influence, and you can guess the way they link together. Winning fights and chasing down bounties provides resources for hiring crew and upgrading your ship which in turn helps you win fights and you get the idea.
</p>
<p>Watching the trailer for Seablip above gave me a full, Ratatouille-like zoom to a memory of playing Puzzle Pirates nearly twenty years ago. Puzzle Pirates is <a href="https://www.puzzlepirates.com/">still going</a>, I discovered! It's a pirate MMO where every activity is a different puzzle game and it was colourful and cosy in a way Seablip seems reminiscent of, in vibe if not substance.
</p>
<p>You'll find Seablip <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471270/Seablip/">on Steam</a> where it's £11.51/€13.31/$13.49. It's aiming for a full release next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-microtransactions-ubisoft-confirms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent blog post, Ubisoft outlined the monetisation plans for XDefiant, the soon-to-launch first-person shooter that’s totally free to play. As you might expect, there will be plenty of optional purchases in XDefiant, but Ubisoft has pledged that there will be no ‘pay-to-win’ mechanics. The full breakdown provided below details how your money can be spent in XDefiant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-amazing-customisation-options">‘Amazing Customisation Options’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/1Xg1YrL6SEcqcuTDNIYSGz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft has stressed</a> a critical point by stating boldly that there will be no pay-to-win elements in XDefiant. It was confirmed that any ‘gameplay-impacted content’ can be both purchased and earned in-game, which means that users can either get their hands on something immediately or grind the game and unlock it over time.</p>



<p>XDefiant will reward players for investing their time and effort into the game, it was revealed. That means that even going on a losing streak will reward you with experience points and content. Here are the kinds of rewards you’ll unlock for progressing through the game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Battle Pass Rewards</li>



<li>In-Game Challenges</li>



<li>Ubisoft Connect Challenges</li>



<li>Weapon Mastery</li>



<li>Participation Rewards</li>
</ul>



<p>Ubisoft then confirmed that customisation is at the heart of the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to be providing amazing customisation options that reward all of the matches, victories, and even defeats that you put into the game. We know being able to display your identity as a player is important, and so customization will be key to the XDefiant experience.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, players will be able to both unlock and purchase:</p>



<ul>
<li>Character Skins</li>



<li>Weapon Skins</li>



<li>MVP Player Animations</li>



<li>Player Cards</li>



<li>Emoji Packs</li>
</ul>



<p>Players will also be prompted to purchase a premium battle pass when they start playing XDefiant – but there will also be a free pathway that’ll reward players with <strong>less prestigious </strong>unlocks. </p>



<p>Are you going to invest any extra money in XDefiant?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-wont-be-long-now-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-won%E2%80%99t-be-long-now-before-launch.874920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-hopes-it-wont-be-long-now-before-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Fallout London Project Manager Dean Carter also said the community would want support for Fallout 4 pre- and post-next-generation update, and the team is considering whether that is feasible.</p>
<p><em>We are being tempted by community feedback to launch on the old version alongside the new version. But this isn't set in stone as it would effectively double our release workload.</em></p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> The Fallout London total conversion mod for Fallout 4 was supposed to launch on St. George's Day, April 23rd, but Bethesda's next-generation update <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-mod-is-officially-delayed-due-to-bethesdas-upcoming-fallout-4-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupted those plans</a>.</p>
<p>We last heard from the team over a month ago when they announced the inevitable delay without being able to nail down another date. This morning, Project Manager Dean Carter (known online as Prilladog) posted an update on the Fallout London Discord channel. To be clear, the message isn't mainly about the release date; it is instead an endorsement of GOG, which helped the Fallout London team a lot with the mod's distribution. The update also links to a new interview <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-london-gog-release-delay-fallout-4-update-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on The Gamer</a> featuring both GOG and Dean Carter himself. The Project Manager said:</p>
<p><em>We initiated discussions with GOG to release Fallout London after Nexus faced challenges hosting the files. Without the combined help of Nexus Mods and GOG, releasing Fallout: London wouldn't be possible.</em></p>
<p>However, right after linking to the article, Prilladog also wrote, 'We hope not long now—fingers crossed.' While not exactly a confirmation, it does hint at a forthcoming resolution of the compatibility issues with the new version of Fallout 4.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Fallout London is a fan-made game-sized mod that imagines how the UK's capital would fare following the nuclear apocalypse (something that Bethesda doesn't intend to do in the foreseeable future, as Todd Howard recently confirmed the studio will stick to US settings). It is set in 2237, between the first and second installments and around fifty years before Fallout 4.</p>
<p>According to Team FOLON, the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) wouldn't have made it to the UK, so don't expect to encounter Deathclaws, Super Mutants, and the like. Similarly, there is no Vault-Tec in the UK, though there will be underground shelters. The factions are also entirely new, so players won't find the Enclave, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Institute, et cetera.</p>
<p>In terms of size, Fallout London is massive. Its playable space will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-total-conversion-mod-to-launch-in-april-2024-has-a-playable-space-as-large-as-base-game-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the size of the base Fallout 4 game plus the Far Harbor DLC</a>. Fans can also look forward to 53 main quests, 35 side quests, 25 faction quests, 64 miscellaneous quests, 16 branching gang quests, 7 companions (5 of which are fully voiced with detailed relationship levels and their own companion quests), over 90K recorded voice lines (1.5x the number of lines in Fallout New Vegas or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and only slightly less than Fallout 4, with the difference that Bethesda's game had a voiced protagonist and Fallout London does not), a revamped crafting system for ammo, an overhauled perk and dialogue system with skill and perk checks during dialogues, new player animations such as ladder climbing and swimming, fast travel options such as trains, taxis, and boats, dynamic weather, new smoking mechanics, and playable guitars. To play the mod, you must own Fallout 4 and all of its DLCs.</p>
<p>In other Fallout news, the franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is about to land in Fortnite</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While it might seem unimportant at first, the card sizes and dimensions for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> cards are actually critical to competitive play and fairness within the community. They not only help to avoid cheating, but they also prevent you from getting scammed. </p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true"><em>MTG</em> cards are designed to be a specific size and weight to help protect fans who buy and sell them but also ensure the competitive scene stays free of any cheating. Markedly different cards can have a serious impact on a game, making it difficult to tell what the card does or if the text has even been altered to give a player an advantage through a completely fake rule. If you’re buying, selling, or playing with <em>MTG</em> cards, it’s worth checking if they’re the right size and shape to avoid a humiliating loss. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-are-the-official-mtg-card-sizes-and-dimensions-for-competitive-play" data-injectable="false">What are the official <em>MTG</em> card sizes and dimensions for competitive play?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Scryfall</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">According to Wizards of the Coast, the official <em>MTG</em> card sizes and dimensions for competitive play are<strong> 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm)</strong>. While foil cards are slightly thicker, most cards are <strong>0.012 inches (0.305 mm) in thickness</strong> and weigh between <strong>1.7 and 1.8 grams</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">However, there are a few exceptions to these sizes and dimensions. For example, printing errors can create cards that are slightly larger and heavier. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1997 <em>MTG</em> <em>Vanguard</em></a> set’s Vanguard cards are all 3 inches (7.6 cm) by 5 inches (12.7 cm), meaning they’re all larger but are technically tournament-legal. These get set aside at the start of a game, so they’re more of a gimmick and don’t impact the rest of the game that much. </p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">When it comes to these exceptions, they generally need to be revealed to both the judges and the opponent before a game even starts. If both players agree that a card isn’t fake and can be used for a specific purpose, then, most of the time, it can be. </p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">Obviously, this isn’t always the case, but when it comes to proxies and cards of that type, the general rule of thumb is that as long as you’re upfront about them with your opponent and agree to work with them in your game, they’re fine. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Why do <em>MTG</em> cards have to be a specific size and weight?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">The reason <em>MTG</em> cards must conform to specific dimensions, size, and weight is because it’s considered marking if they don’t. Card marking is illegal in competitive play because it gives you an unfair advantage over your opponent. </p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">You could compare this to drawing a black line on the back of a powerful card or one you know you need for your planned strategy. If you’ve got a hand that allows you to get your card, if you know that it’s potentially only five cards deep in your deck, that’s unfair on your opponent who doesn’t know where their cards are in their deck. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Furthermore, a weighted card, or one that’s slightly bigger than the rest, could make it easier to pick out in cases where your opponent gives you a set of face-down cards to pick from. There are several strategies where bigger cards can be of help in a game, which is why all cards must stick to the outlined sizing. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Another advantage of this strict rule on card sizes is that it makes it harder for anyone to create fake cards and sell them for a profit. This could become a real problem, especially with cards like the One of One Ring from the <em>Tales of Middle-Earth</em> set. If cards didn’t have a set weight, even for foil versions, then it would be far too easy to fake rare cards for a profit. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/18/24159721/retrohai-nintendo-ds-lite-game-boy-color-advance-sp-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever looked at a Nintendo DS and thought it would be cooler if the top screen was swapped for the Game Boy Advance SP’s? Or looked at a Super Nintendo controller and wished it had a GBA SP screen bolted onto the back? Whether you have or not, Hardware modder Hairo Satoh, aka Retrohai hai Softbank, has you covered with some truly cursed reimaginings of Nintendo’s portable consoles. (Recall their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125681/now-thats-a-playstation-portable">portable emulated PlayStation</a> built into the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoURW25xReoI">Takara Roulette Controller</a>.) </p><p>Let’s go on a little journey through Satoh’s Instagram account. Before we get into my favorite mutated Nintendo handhelds — frankententos, if you will — know that Satoh also does some very pretty custom jobs on the company’s various portable consoles. And they’re <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17892712832143201/">made to order</a>.</p><p>This one they posted recently is a good example. We are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">Known Transparent Case Stans</a> here at <em>The Verge</em>, but this goes a step further with its colorful hologram stickers and ChromaFlair-style color-changing sheen. Oh, and it runs Game Boy Advance games.</p><p>That controller mod I mentioned up top isn’t the only time Satoh has turned a console gamepad into its own handheld. The GBA SP’s screen looks remarkably at home on an SNES (well, Super Famicom, technically) pad...</p><p>...and on a PS2 Dual Shock controller, too.</p><p>But why not jam one onto a Nintendo DS Lite, too? It doesn’t make sense at all, even if this is a mash-up of the two most attractive pieces of hardware Nintendo ever made, but I don’t need any justification for this thing’s existence. Also, this is the point where things start getting a little cursed.</p><p>I guess this is also a Nintendo DS?</p><p>Again, but more colorful. </p><p>Ah yes, the Original Game Boy Advance SP DS (OGBASPDS). </p><p>I’m enamored with the concept of a multi-position adjustable screen on this original DS.</p><div><p>What if... GBA SP but also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115039/danger-hiptop-t-mobile-sidekick-jump-button">T-Mobile Sidekick</a>?</p></div><p>Give me this and the ability to emulate the fantastic vertical-scrolling shooter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/21/17489520/nintendo-switch-flip-grip-accessory-vertical-arcade-games"><em>Ikaruga</em></a><em>, </em>please<em>.</em></p><p>I’m sorry, what?</p><p>Ah, yes, this makes sense.</p><p>I can’t say I understand the extra buttons and d-pad here, but I respect the chaos.</p><p>The Nintendo Long Boy DS.</p><p>I think this is probably the final boss of Satoh’s inventive creations. </p><p>Satoh didn’t respond to us when we reached out, but we’d love to know more about these creations. How much of these are made up of custom hardware on the inside? How many of them are emulating Nintendo’s handhelds, rather than rejiggering its original hardware components to fit? If we receive a response, we’ll dig in some more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> pre-orders are "looking very strong".</p>
<p>That's according to notable – and often accurate – leaker Tom Henderson, who claims that "no one in the know [at Ubisoft] is disappointed" with the number of pre-orders the highly-anticipated action-RPG has secured so far.</p>

<p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows pre-orders are looking very strong," Henderson said in his full, if brief, statement on Twitter/X. "I don't have the exact numbers yet, but no one in the know is disappointed with them."</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>The pre-orders are likely clocking up after our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-dual-protagonists">first proper look at Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> earlier this week, which detailed the game's dual protagonists. Both characters appear front and centre in the game's new cinematic trailer and on the game's cover, with each offering a markedly different play style. A gameplay trailer will follow next month, Ubisoft says.</p>
<p>As Tom described for us at the time, the teaser embedded above opens on Naoe, a female shinobi, as she crosses paths with Yasuke, the historical figure depicted here as a powerful samurai. Initially, it seems, the two are adversaries - but the pair soon find common ground. By the end of the trailer, Naoe is wearing the Assassin's Creed series' iconic Hidden Blade weapon - and both appear to be at least allied with the Assassins.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boxed-copies-still-require-internet-connection-to-first-play">Assassin's Creed Shadows players will need to connect to the internet to first install the game</a>, although there is no "mandatory connection" requirement.</p>
<p>"We wanted to share some early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," Ubisoft wrote.</p>
<p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection."</p>

            <p>Star Citizen is free to play until 29th May 2024.</p>
<p>The free play period – timed to mark Invictus Launch Week 2954 – enables players to download and play the game for free during the event and "test pilot all 87 military vehicles for a limited time", with all ships available to test drive for the final three days of the show. You can also expect "surprise reveals" throughout the week, too.</p>

<p>"A variety of collaborative in-game events designed in the spirit of 'One Empire', and how each citizen’s individual contributions help create humanity's unrivaled power of unity that has taken it beyond the stars, showcase the might of the UEE Navy and invites citizens to explore the vessels that keep the ‘verse safe," Cloud Imperium Games teases.</p>
<p>"The improved New Player Experience, originally released for Area18 in Alpha 3.19, has been expanded and is now supported on all starting locations. While the same core skills are taught at each location, new players can now choose to begin high in the cloud city of Orison, in the mining town of Lorville owned and operated by Hurston Dynamics, on New Babbage, which is both a bustling major trading hub and home to high-end electronic companies, or back at Area18’s urban downtown where bright lights attract commerce and entertainment."</p>
<p>Existing players who convince a pal to jump on-board can also secure a 5000 aUEC bonus if their friend uses their referral code.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium Games' CEO, Chris Roberts, recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">Star Citizen was pushing towards the "finish line" of a 1.0 release</a>.</p>
<p>"After many hard years of work towards a goal many thought was impossible, we are on the cusp of delivering one of the final pieces of technology that will enable a connected, shared universe that thousands of people can experience together at the same time," Roberts explained in his <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">latest Letter from the Chairman update</a> in March.</p>
<p>We recently reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-hit-with-layoffs-amid-claims-of-a-highly-toxic-company">Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games had suffered layoffs</a> amid unrest due to relocation and accusations of a "highly toxic company".</p>

  <p id="NVaWDO">While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23920816"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>’s alternate history means the show is already much more racially diverse than other Regency-era romances, the show so far has still been very heteronormative and deeply patriarchal, even with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23709730/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-review">Queen Charlotte</a> ruling. If women can’t even inherit property without a man or an heir, they definitely can’t kiss other women (and same goes for dudes). </p>
<p id="tvqmrM">But new showrunner Jess Brownell told <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/05/11718497/bridgerton-queer-storylines-future-showrunner-interview">Refinery29 Australia</a> that queer main characters will be featured in the show’s future seasons. </p>
<p id="qRtw0k">“I think this is a show about the many ways in which people love,” said Brownell. “So it only feels right to show all the ways in which people love, including queer love. So we are exploring queer love stories across the next couple of seasons,” she added.</p>
<p id="DxWgt0">Now, Brownell was tight-lipped about just <em>which</em> characters would have queer romances. But there are some strong contenders — especially when it comes to the Bridgerton family. </p>

In the first season, he went to a wild party hosted by artist Henry Granville, and eventually learned about Granville’s clandestine relationship with another man. </p>
<p id="w3aJl9">And Benedict (Luke Thompson) is the most artsy-fartsy of the Bridgerton siblings. Being avant-garde and in touch with one’s artistic side is a stereotype that filmmakers and TV writers alike have used to indicate that a <a href="https://www.them.us/story/high-school-musical-ryan-gay">male character is queer for decades</a>. </p>
<p id="IMRAs0">While all of the brothers aren’t super keen on finding a match, he’s the one who’s arguably put the least effort in, and shown the least interest in, actually courting a woman. Before <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown">Anthony met Kate</a>, he was smitten with his opera singer mistress. And Colin even proposed to Marina Thompson back in season 1. But Benedict’s only really been interested in the sexual part of relationships. It could be that he’s missing a certain spark. </p>
<p id="B8SirI">This season, he strikes up yet another sexual relationship with a new female character. This time, though, Lady Tilley Arnold (Hannah New) is a widow, and described by <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/10/bridgerton-season-three-hannah-new-black-sails-starz-netflix-shonda-rhimes-1235143731/">Deadline</a> as a ”living life on her own terms with financial independence and sexual freedom.” In the first half of season 3, we certainly see her hold her own with the men of the Ton — but could that sexual freedom mean opening Benedict’s mind beyond heterosexuality? </p>

<p id="MNrFne">Eloise (Claudia Jessie) has rejected societal conventions from the very first season. She doesn’t want to get married at all and would rather wax on about the rights of women. She and Penelope once bonded over this, back when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995119/bridgerton-lady-whistledown-spoiler">Eloise was inspired by Lady Whistledown</a>. Of course, that got a wrench thrown into it, but Eloise constantly seeks female friendship in a way that we don’t really see with the other female characters her age, who are more preoccupied with finding a proper suitor. </p>
<p id="Vcywpq">Female characters who speak out against marriage and traditional social norms often end up coded as queer when it comes to most movies and TV shows, particularly ones with historical settings. Even if they’re not textually presented as queer, many <a href="https://www.them.us/story/little-women-greta-gerwig-jo-march-queer">fans spark to these characters and claim them</a>. </p>
<p id="Y7xC8J">Even though she had a bit of a flirtation with a charming newspaper boy in season 2, Eloise’s closest relationships outside her family are with other women. This season, we see her grow closer with Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), which brings a nice depth to Cressida’s Mean Girl antics. Both Eloise and Cressida confide in each other about wanting to live their own lives without being married. And we see them seeking out each other’s company at events, in a way that almost plays out like a traditional courtship. </p>
<p id="UpewzB">When asked about possible queer-coding in Eloise and Cressida’s relationship, <a href="https://decider.com/2024/05/17/bridgerton-season-3-jessica-madsen-cressida-cowper-interview/">Madsen told Decider</a> that she’d be stoked if that was the case.</p>
<p id="Ne6VDh">“I absolutely love that,” she said. “That would be the best! Yeah, I mean, that would be cool. I like to think it would make sense because, like, she hasn’t bagged a guy. So, like, why not a gal?”</p>
<p id="6B7KyA">Eloise and Benedict share a particularly special relationship too, one that makes them very much at odds with their more marriage-focused family. They’re often seen together, making jests at the expense of the ladies and gentlemen of the Ton. They’re both the second-eldest son/daughter, both have a passion for something other than being a rich person. While some of the other Bridgerton siblings weren’t too keen on the idea of marriage in the first place (like  Anthony and Francesca), Eloise and Benedict more openly reject the institution of marriage. </p>

<p id="y2ybms">Now there <em>is</em> an existing fully-fleshed out and beautifully poignant queer love story in the Bridgerton universe — but you’d have to watch the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23715775/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-spinoff-brimsley-reynolds"><em>Queen Charlotte</em> miniseries</a> to experience it. As it turns out, the Queen’s butler Brimsley is in a long relationship with the King’s butler Reynolds. We saw the full extent of that relationship in the prequel, but we haven’t seen Reynolds in the modern day. He <em>could</em> be dead, but also we just haven’t seen a lot of King George at all, so maybe Reynolds is simply attending to his boss and we’ll see the gay butlers reunited!</p>

<p id="s9bv1T">There is, of course, the strong chance that the queer <em>Bridgerton</em> love story does not belong to one of the main siblings. After all, this is a show with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22991651/bridgerton-season-1-recap-season-2">a <em>lot</em> of characters and side plots</a>. Maybe it’s a heavily featured side character (sapphic arc for Lady Danbury, perhaps?), or maybe it is someone introduced solely in an upcoming season to have a background romance. </p>
<p id="HQOb5Y">Hopefully this promised queer love story is given just as much weight as the heterosexual ones. After all, this is an alternate history, where love conquers all and the showrunners aren’t exactly beholden to historical accuracy. </p>
<p id="mVKx76">As Brownell says: “We have the privilege of living in this fantasy world which means we can push back against some of the reality of what happened in the 1800s.”</p>

<p data-characters="335" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are few games that are still going as strong, even after over ten years, like <em>Minecraft</em>. But, even today, there are plenty of ways to play the game by checking out different seeds. This way, you’ll still have plenty of adventures and tons of fun. However, you might need to do a little searching for the best possible seed.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Seeds in <em>Minecraft</em>, instead of having a randomly generated world, are worlds already set up with plenty to find in them. After so many years of the beloved survival game being around, there’s a chance of it getting stale, but these seeds will let you enjoy everything that 2024 has to offer for the beloved title.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-1-sakura-season-seed-5584399987456711267" data-injectable="false">1. Sakura Season (<strong>Seed: -5584399987456711267</strong>)</h2> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Cherry blossoms are just as magical in <em>Minecraft</em> as they are in real life. This seed lets you enjoy the beautiful pink trees in a huge Cherry Blossom biome, which was introduced in the 1.20 update. Randomly generated maps aren’t always going to feature tons of stunning trees, but this seed lets you enjoy tons of them everywhere you look. It’s easily one of the prettiest seeds you’ll find.</p>
 <h2 id="h-2-shipwreck-survival-seed-8065848147699287859" data-injectable="false">2. Shipwreck Survival (Seed: -8065848147699287859)</h2> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">Coming across a shipwreck while out sailing is a great find, since there can be a hoard of treasures within. However, it’s much harder when you spawn on the shipwreck itself. This seed starts you out on one of the shipwrecks, surrounded by nothing but ocean as far as you can see. You’ll need to scavenge materials from the shipwreck, build a boat, and begin your voyage to find any land you can.</p>
 <h2 id="h-3-giant-cavern-seed-7445395903252703439" data-injectable="false">3. Giant Cavern (Seed: 7445395903252703439)</h2> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Similar to the previous seed, this one instead spawns you inside of a massive cavern underground, with the goal of working your way up and out. Of course, being deep in the earth, there are plenty of resources for you to take to make it easier to build your way up to the surface. There are tons of smaller winding caves to explore in the cavern, and other great finds with this cool seed.</p> <figure data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-coastal-village-seed-7783854906403730143" data-injectable="false">4. Coastal Village (Seed: -7783854906403730143)</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">This seed will spawn you right next to a charming village right on the water. While there are great places for adventuring nearby, such as the mountains and ocean ruins, there are also plenty of great views in the village on the shore. It’s a perfect balance of cozy gaming to make a great farm and house, and adventuring to find the best gear and resources like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-minecraft-iron-level-explained/">iron</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-mooshroom-biome-seed-859337968100847433" data-injectable="false">5. Mooshroom Biome (Seed: 859337968100847433)</h2> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">What’s more enticing than mushroom cows? Since they were introduced into <em>Minecraft </em>years ago, Mooshrooms have been one of the most beloved mobs in the game. This seed gives you plenty of them to enjoy the company of, with a massive mushroom biome to explore when you travel to the island located at the coordinates 128, 66.

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Regarding Call of Duty, it’s easy to argue that <em>Black Ops</em> is perhaps the most beloved and popular series in the franchise’s history. With <em>Black Ops 6</em> firmly on the horizon, I’ve looked through the last 16 years to rank every Treyarch-developed game from worst to best. </p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">It’s a testament to the quality of the <em>Black Ops </em>series that Treyarch is widely viewed as the best <em>Call of Duty</em> developer, which made ranking the six mainline entries difficult. A dev team rarely has no absolute stinkers in their library, but Treyarch has never made a bad <em>CoD</em> game, at least in my opinion. </p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">However, this is an article to rank them all, so I couldn’t sit on the fence and say that they’re all great, which is why we’ve ranked them all in order. For this list, we’ve included <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em>, as it is viewed as the beginning of the <em>Black Ops </em>series due to characters from it appearing in 2010’s <em>Black Ops</em>. </p>
 <hr data-injectable="false"> <h2 id="h-6-black-ops-4" data-injectable="false">6. <em>Black Ops 4</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>It has its moments. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2018</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Multiplayer, Zombies, Blackout</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Picking the worst <em>Black Ops</em> game is like going to a donut shop and picking the least tasty one: They’re all pretty good. There had to be a loser though, and for me, <em>Black Ops 4</em> is probably the least memorable title in the series, and always felt like I wasn’t sure what kind of <em>Call of Duty</em> game it was. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The return to “boots on the ground” <em>CoD</em> was certainly welcome, but bringing Specialist abilities back meant that <em>BO4</em> felt like an odd mix of classic<em> </em>and futuristic <em>Call of Duty</em> that never quite worked for me. The decision not to release with a campaign also damaged this title, and the public reception to it meant Black Ops 4 was on the back foot before it was even released. </p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">Treyarch does deserve credit for the game though, for the most part, the multiplayer was fun and Blackout was a great introduction to Battle Royale in CoD, laying the groundwork for the ultra-successful Warzone. While Blackout was a little clunky and wasn’t updated very often, it was still an enjoyable experience, one that shaped the <em>Call of Duty</em> we play today. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. <em>World at War</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>The first entry into the franchise. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2008</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false"><em>World at War</em> is viewed as the starting part of the <em>Black Ops</em> franchise, even though it doesn’t feature the series’ iconic title. Set during World War II, it was a stark change from the previous year’s game, <em>Call of Duty 4</em>: <em>Modern Warfare</em>. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">As it’s the oldest <em>CoD</em> game on this list, it’s easy to write it off, but to do so would be a mistake. The campaign is one of my personal favorites—It’s dark and gritty, and switching between the Americans and the Soviets really gives you a feeling that you’re not in control of what’s happening, and the true intensity of war. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">Of course, you can’t talk about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-call-of-duty-world-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WAW</a></em> without gushing about Zombies, the starting point of the legendary mode, and some of my favorite memories in <em>Call of Duty</em>. I can still picture myself sitting in my old bedroom playing Nacht der Untoten with my buddies, even though I was terrible at it. </p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, multiplayer is where I feel like <em>World at War</em> slips down this list, as I didn’t enjoy many of the maps, the weapon meta was dominated by the PPSh-41, and the inclusion of tanks didn’t feel like <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer to me. In truth, I ended up returning to <em>CoD4</em> before the year ended, and I never looked back. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. <em>Black Ops 3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Just too much going on in multiplayer for me. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2015</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, macOS, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies, Bonus (Dead Ops Arcade, Nightmares, Freerun)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">Look, before I get into <em>Black Ops 3</em>, I have to be honest. <em>Advanced Warfare</em> is, in my opinion, the best jetpack <em>Call of Duty</em> game by a mile, and I don’t care what anyone says. So with that in mind, there was simply no way I could rank it any higher than this, even though I know <em>BO3</em> has its loyalists who think it’s the best <em>CoD</em> ever. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="735" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 3</a></em> multiplayer is fun, but I think the jetpacks are almost too powerful. Being able to wall-run and dash to the sides made it play too quick for my liking, and at times it felt like you were playing <em>Halo</em> rather than <em>CoD</em>. It does have some really good maps like Stronghold or Evac, but it’s also got some stinkers like Exodus and Havoc which were just not enjoyable to play. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">For me, <em>BO3</em> also has the weakest campaign in the series and ended up being a confusing experience that didn’t really explain why you were doing anything. The campaign gameplay is fun and does have some good moments, but it’s not enough to make up for the flawed story. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. <em>Black Ops Cold War</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>My favorite of the recent <em>CoD</em> releases. Image via Treyarch. </figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2020</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><em>Black Ops Cold War</em> is my favorite of the “modern” <em>Call of Duty</em> titles and was lightyears better than 2019’s <em>Modern Warfare</em> reboot. There’s a lot to like about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BOCW</a></em>, with a solid campaign that’s bolstered by the fact that decisions you make during the story can change the ending you see. I ended up completing it a couple of times to see what happened, which is something I rarely do with <em>CoD</em> campaigns. </p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">The Zombies Dark Aether storyline was also really strong, and the gameplay was, in my opinion, the best since <em>Black Ops 2</em>. The maps were good, the gameplay didn’t get too convoluted, and it was generally an enjoyable experience. Multiplayer on this game was also great, with gunplay feeling much more rewarding than <em>MW</em> and classic maps returning to the game. I spent hours playing <em>BOCW</em>‘s Ranked Mode, and if it was still live, I’d be tempted to go back. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">My only real gripe with <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> is how strong the skill-based matchmaking felt in multiplayer, which made playing matches feel more like work than fun at times. Still, I have fond memories of this game, and it almost feels harsh to rank it third. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <em>Black Ops</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>The jump from <em>World at War</em> to <em>Black Ops</em> is huge. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2010</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, macOS, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo DS</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">The first <em>CoD</em> game to boast the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops</a></em> title, Treyarch’s 2010 is an almost flawless <em>Call of Duty</em> game. The campaign was the best in the entire franchise at the time, with an ending (which we won’t spoil in case you haven’t played it) that will blow your mind. </p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Multiplayer gameplay was also excellent, with weapons that were enjoyable and rewarding to use, while the maps were also widely excellent. <em>Black Ops</em> is the game that introduced Nuketown, one of <em>CoD</em>‘s most iconic maps that is recreated to this day, showing how influential this game really was. </p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">No surprise, but <em>Black Ops’ </em>Zombies mode is also brilliant, with unique maps that each posed different challenges, a solid storyline that weaved through every map, and great gameplay that added new guns like the Thunder and Wave Guns.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">1. <em>Black Ops 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>The undisputed King of <em>CoD</em>. Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Release year: </strong>2012</li> <li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii U</li> <li><strong>Modes: </strong>Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="147" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> is the pinnacle of the franchise. It’s not just the best <em>Black Ops </em>game, it’s the best <em>Call of Duty</em>, period. </p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BO2</a></em> was the first campaign in the series to use branching storylines, with decisions you make affecting the ending you get. Better than that, the choices have real stakes and really invest you in the story. Treyarch went above and beyond in this campaign and hasn’t been able to match it since. </p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Zombies in <em>Black Ops 2</em> is good, not great, but still, a really fun experience that is boosted by its incredible gunplay and all-around gameplay. Mob, Origins, and Die Rise are all solid maps that each have their unique style too, helping to keep the mode fresh. </p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><em>Black Ops 2</em> multiplayer, however, is where this game blows everything else out of the water. This game has arguably the best maps in the franchise, with remakes still popping up in <em>CoD </em>games to this day. On top of that, the guns feel so rewarding to use, the Pick 10 class system is still yearned for by players, and League Play is the standard to which all <em>CoD</em> Ranked Play modes are still held, and none have managed to better it yet. </p>
 <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">A truly perfect <em>Call of Duty</em> game, and one that has yet to be matched in the 12 years since its release. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I have played Sins of a Solar Empire 2, and I am poorer for it. This sequel is extremely similar to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/15/sins-of-a-solar-empire-review">original real-time 4X strategy game</a> from 2008 (including a lot, but not all of the content from its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/13/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion-review">2012 Rebellion expansion</a>) with nicer graphics and needed engine improvements. That alone is more than welcome for a game that’s had such staying power, and revamps to its well-differentiated and complex factions give them even more depth to explore. However, the version that stealth-launched out of early access on the Epic Games Store feels rougher and less complete than a lot of games when they launch <em>into</em> early access. Expanding my empire, conquering planets, and watching my fleets do battle with rivals and bomb their planets to ash did grow on me a bit once a friend and I worked together and eventually taught ourselves its ins and outs, but getting to that point was so much less fun than it should’ve been that any joy was sucked out of it like atmosphere through a hull breach.</p><p>For context, I played Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion a fair amount a decade ago, and have been playing 4X and real-time strategy games habitually long before and since. And yet, after buying Sins of a Solar Empire 2 and jumping in, I felt completely lost. There are no tutorials for this enormously complex game (outside of a website with a quick-start guide that’s barely more than a glossary), and the in-game instructions you do get for things as relatively simple as climbing the research tree to unlock essential technologies often send you on wild goose chases through the confusing interface. For every ounce of interstellar entertainment I managed to laboriously mine like metal from an asteroid, there was always some major headache to accompany it. Between that sort of thing, bugs, grayed-out options in the map creation interface, and a lack of a server browser to play with people you don’t know, it clearly isn’t a finished product. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Sins of a Solar Empire 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>There is no way to talk about how Sins of a Solar Empire 2 ended up like this without addressing its strange exit from early access at some uncertain point earlier this year – a warning label it really shouldn’t have dropped in its current state. After arriving on the Epic Games Store back in early 2022 as a “technical preview,” it recently removed all caveats from its store page without so much as an official press release. Instead, the publisher, Stardock, has announced a Steam launch date for this August, which promises a major patch that will include significant new features, such as the third race called the Advent and its two factions that are already listed as playable on the store page but are currently nowhere to be found. </p><p>In comments around that announcement, Stardock CEO Brad Wardell stated that you “only get one shot at a Steam release,” (where the vast majority of PC games are sold). So the plan is to wait until then to get the word out properly. It’s not a crazy idea: any strategy game enjoyer will tell you that you should save your limited resources for the moment they’ll have the maximum effect, and the same is true of game marketing dollars. But while that may sound reasonable from a business perspective, the reality is quite misleading for anyone looking to play Sins of a Solar Empire 2 who stumbles across the Epic Games Store page right now. This isn’t some hypothetical misunderstanding, either: my friend and I actually did spend a while looking for the Advent as we played. Did we have to unlock them? Enable an option in some menu? Play a couple games with the other races first? Nope. They’re just not there yet. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As of today, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is about as barebones as can be.</p></div><p>I’d like to tell you the rest of it is better, but as of today Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is about as barebones as can be considering how many systems are packed in on top of combat, including diplomacy, trade, culture spread, and pirate bounties among others. It’s disappointing that there’s no story campaign – there isn’t one in the original Sins of the Solar Empire, either, and it proved it didn’t require one any more than Civilization or Stellaris do, but it’s long been a fan-requested feature and it might’ve gone a long way toward gradually introducing us to how everything works rather than throwing you into the deep end. Instead, it took me and a friend several hours of fumbling through a couple of games against the AI to nail down how one of the two human factions even worked, and again, we’re both RTS and 4X veterans. </p><p>Once, when I was trying to build something I had insufficient research points for as the alien Vasari race, I was told to build more orbital labs. The problem is that you don’t get research points for building orbital labs – they just speed up your research <em>rate</em>. You get the actual research points by buying upgrades on each planet’s development tracker menu, but you’d never know that unless you happened to mouse over the tooltip on the right button instead of doing what you’re told to do. </p><p>Sometimes buttons don’t seem to do anything at all… until they do. Here’s an example: the construction ships you get from colonizing planets have a button literally labeled “Build Structure,” but clicking it has no discernable effect because nothing you click on afterward, be it a planet, ship, asteroid, or anything else will give you the option to build something… unless you click on an orbital structure that’s already queued to be built, which then tells the ship to prioritize that building over any others in the queue. If you actually want to build a new building, you’ll select it from a separate menu; the ship will build it without you ever having to control it directly. </p><p>It’s a problem that the interface is confusing because you'll spend a lot of Sins of a Solar Empire 2 in menus. When you’re not grouping your ships into fleets and ordering them to jump from one planet’s gravity well to the next or focus their fire on an enemy capital ship, you’re going into a menu, clicking a button, and waiting for the thing you’re researching or the ship you’re building to complete, and then you’ll click another button in another menu and wait some more. That’s fine because that's just the kind of game Sins is – it has as much or more in common with Crusader Kings 3 as it does with StarCraft 2, so there’s very little micromanagement of individual units beyond retreating them as they’re damaged or triggering capital ship abilities manually. Managing an efficient build order offers satisfying challenges, but you want those challenges to be about interesting choices rather than figuring out how to make them in the first place.</p><p>Through hours of experimentation, I finally discovered that the developers at Ironclad have actually added some nice quality-of-life features to the interface. If you want to build or research something but don't have the necessary prerequisites, the Intelligent Construction System will queue all of the things you need up to be researched in order and let you check their progress in real-time. The new Empire Management screen lets you, well… manage everything in your sinful solar empire – planets, fleets, starbases, the whole space enchilada – from one page. That beats the heck out of clicking around the star system for each of them, shortcuts or not. </p><p>Then there's the new Fleet Management System, which allows you to request reinforcements for any of your specific fleets directly from that fleet's menu – no heading back to a planet to queue them up and setting the rally point required. New ships are then built at the closest factory and rallied to that fleet automatically (though you can opt for traditional rally points if that's more your speed). These are all good, smart additions that make Sins of a Solar Empire 2 easier and more engaging to play, once you figure them out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the fun combat stuff is saved for the late game.</p></div><p>When it comes to space combat, the basic idea hasn’t changed: you mostly build big fleets and throw them at your opponent, then watch them duke it out in entertainingly flashy battles that – as you’d hope – put the original Sins’ to shame in terms of detail and ship behavior. Instead of ships largely lining up and plinking away at the other side until someone explodes like a Civil War reenactment in space, we now have smaller classes that dart around like large fighters, and larger ships are loaded with gun turrets that swivel to track targets, bringing much more of a sense of action. Long-range missiles can be intercepted by point defenses or blocked by other ships before they hit something expensive, which is a nice nibble of tactical depth for those looking to micro something. And at the top of the Warfare tech tree sits the Titan, a single enormous, faction-specific behemoth that can take on entire fleets by itself. Watching all of these ships shooting all these different weapons, exploding, and making emergency phase jumps out of a system before their hull points tick down to zero looks pretty cool when you’re zoomed in, but early skirmishes with basic units are generally pretty dull.</p><p>Like its predecessor, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 saves most of the fun stuff for the late game when you unlock tech that can do a lot of damage in a hurry. The pinnacle of that is the human’s Novalith cannon, which can shoot massive, literally world-ending shells across the solar system and take out enemy planets in one hit, as opposed to bombarding them into submission with a fleet after bashing through whatever turrets or starbases the enemy has built up to defend it. That’s awesome normally, but it’s even more so (and way funnier) when you have two Novaliths target the enemy’s home planet – you know, just to be sure – and eliminate them from the match without ever moving a fleet into orbit. Then you’ve got the Vasari’s Orkulus starbase, which is essentially just a bigger, angrier version of the Cylon Basestar from Battlestar Galactica. Armed to the absolute teeth and containing several support fighters, it’s all but unstoppable by conventional weapons and, once you upgrade it, it can jump to other planets like a spaceship. Nasty.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking of the two current races, they’re fairly different from one another, which means there’s a lot of learning to do but also a ton of opportunity to experiment with tactics and strategies geared toward their strengths. The human Trader Emergency Coalition (TEC), for instance, needs credits to manage their economy and build things. The super-advanced alien Vasari don’t, though money gives them access to the galactic markets where they can buy resources. There are unique ships and structures for each race, including several that are unique to one of their two sub-factions. The TEC, for instance, currently has the only ship that repairs others on the fly, while the Vasari can build Phase Gates that allow them to immediately jump between planets that aren’t connected by phase lanes. </p><p>That’s taken even further by some of the biggest additions to Sins of a Solar Empire 2, such as the Empire System bonuses. The TEC’s Trade Port structures were in the original game and provided a steady stream of credits, but now they allow you to allocate points to boost your production of metal, crystal, or credits on the fly. The Vasari, meanwhile, can build all-new Phase Resonators that let you allocate points to upgrade ships, their research rate, and so on. I love these additions; they add some spice to each race’s already distinct flavor while offering interesting strategic choices that allow you to build your economy or military in cool, unique ways.</p><p>Drilling down further into the subfactions, there are a lot of options to suit different playstyles. The Loyalist TEC, for instance, are more defensive, gaining access to planetary garrisons of ships that are produced automatically and don’t take up population cap, but have limited range. They can also build two starbases around a planet instead of one, which can make conquering their systems an especially difficult nut to crack. The TEC Rebels, however, are much more about offense: They get the aforementioned planet-destroying Novalith cannon, can ally with pirate factions and build a pirate base in a system they control, get economic bonuses for going on the attack, and can use propaganda abilities to make their ships more effective in combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your chosen faction makes a big difference in how you play.</p></div><p>The Vasari are similarly divided between defensive and offensive factions. The Exodus are here for a good time, not a long time, so they’re happy to force humans into labor camps, strip mine the cores of planets they don’t need, and gain resources by destroying things. The Alliance, meanwhile, is all about fostering cooperation with other races, trade, and good table manners. They want to put down roots and stick around for the long term.</p><p>These distinctions sound subtle, but they make a big difference in how you play (and serve as the majority of the lore you’ll find). I was more fond of the Rebels for the TEC because I tend to prefer an aggressive playstyle, and in my experience, purely defending in Sins of a Solar Empire 2 isn’t going to win you the war. Like any good – sorry, <em>successful</em> – empire, you have to expand or you’ll eventually get overwhelmed. But when I needed to hold out long enough so my teammate could provide support against the two AI opponents I was facing down, those Loyalist garrisons sure did come in handy. With the Vasari, though, I much preferred making alliances with the Minor Factions (small AI players who don’t expand) and supporting my teammate, though I had a couple of nasty fleets capturing planets by the end. I like that the Factions provide so much variety, and when Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works, it feels good (mechanically, not morally) to build your empire up, expand, and conquer your neighbors.</p><p>And, in a nice touch, there are a lot of options for map generation, ranging from recommended player counts (between two and 10) on procedurally generated star systems to specific scenarios with unique challenges. Most of that is carried over from the original, but Sins of a Solar Empire 2 introduces planets and other astral bodies that rotate around stars, which can open up new phase lanes between them when they get close enough. That sounds a bit cooler than it is in practice because it can take hours for rotations to sync up in a way that truly matters (and on smaller maps, it might never happen at all), but when the stars literally align it can let you hit an enemy with a surprise attack on a world they thought was protected by heavily defended neighbors. You have a Future Orbits button that shows you how phase lanes will change for up to an hour into the future, so it’s not left up to chance or guesswork. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Will's Favorite RTS/4X Games</h3><p>Playing Sins of a Solar Empire 2 made me reflect on some of my favorite RTS and 4X games. Here they are.</p></div><p>But, man, so many things just feel incomplete or underbaked. Take the Minor Factions, for instance. You gain favor with them – and special bonuses – by spending Influence Points; when I was playing the Vasari Alliance, Influence Points were easy to get, so I earned lots of bonuses, but once I’d more or less unlocked everything I could only use the points to bid on auctions for resources. Being buddy-buddy with a Minor Faction doesn’t really do anything for you aside from getting you some abilities and making it so they’re (sometimes?) not actively hostile. Like most things in Sins of a Solar Empire 2, it’s hard to tell because there’s not much in-game to clue you in until you’ve pieced together a lot of disparate tooltips and experimented enough to find the right answer.</p><p>Then there are the bugs. I’ve already mentioned misleading audio cues telling me to build the wrong thing, but I’ve also had incorrect notifications telling me an enemy had conquered a planet I’d just colonized and so I spent a minute trying to figure out what happened before realizing, “Oh, it was me who conquered the planet, actually.” Once, I started a team game with a friend where we were clearly set to be allied, only to be told we weren’t once we got into the match, forcing us to fix it in-game. </p><p>There are also entire menu options grayed out that control things like “Orbiting Planet Speed,” or “Research Rates,” or “Ship Build Rates” when you try to adjust pre-game settings – you know, things you might like some say in when you’re setting up a match – that just aren’t available. There’s a tooltip telling you that these options are disabled “as we collect balance feedback,” which is fair, but these limitations just drive home how unfinished everything is. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it works, it really works - it just needs to get us there with less frustration.</p></div><p>All of that said, when Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works, it really works. There's a lot of nuance when it comes to choosing your upgrade paths, deciding which structures to build on your planets, how to spend each planet’s limited orbital slots, and constructing your fleets. Do you go for an economic opening or a military one? Which capital ship do you start with, and why? What upgrades do you give it? What kind of research do you prioritize? Do you trade with other players, or buy the resources you need on the market? How much, if at all, do you engage with the Minor Factions on the map? If a battle looks like it will come down to the wire, do you pull your fleet out and live to fight another day, or go all in and bet on the victory?</p><p>The consequences of those choices, and the choices your opponents make in response to them, determine how games play out. The right decision at the right time – even one as seemingly small as prioritizing one research upgrade over another or choosing a specific capital ship to lead your first fleet – can snowball and make all the difference in an interplanetary power struggle that can last for a dozen hours or more. In its best moments, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 understands that, and that makes for compelling, memorable matches. It just needs to get us there much faster and with less frustration along the way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The latest episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> Season 14 dropped onto streaming services on May 17. While the episode is undeniably mostly filler, one thing happened that has sparked discussion among eager Whovians—the Doctor’s next companion made a rather large appearance.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">In the third episode of the latest season, ‘Boom’, written by Steven Moffat, the Doctor and Ruby find themselves on a wartorn planet where the Doctor runs headfirst into danger, directly onto a landmine. Cue an entire episode where he can’t move while the action comes to him. Like I said, it’s mainly filler.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Of course there are some key moments worth paying attention to, such as the fifth known re-appearance of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-showrunner-russel-t-davies-confirms-the-importance-of-susan-twists-reappearances/">Susan Twist</a>, who plays the AI Ambulance in Boom, and the mysterious snow which seems to fall around Ruby at strange moments.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">However, the biggest thing to come out of Boom is the fact that, ahead of her becoming the Doctor’s next Companion in season 15, Veradu Sethu made an appearance as what could be considered a main character in the episode.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">I won’t go into too much detail about her role in the episode, but she plays an ordained soldier named Mundy Flynn (which was the source of a strangely timed joke about how she should marry Ruby and become “Mundy Sunday”), taking part in the war that’s currently ravaging the planet. Of course, she faces some heartbreak and tough decisions in the episode, but the question on the minds of Whovians everywhere is why is she here, and will she still be playing Mundy when she returns in season 15?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Let’s face it: this is <em>Doctor Who</em>, where even the Doctor himself admits that everything is possible, so Verada could come back as literally anyone else. We even have some precedent for that, given Jenna Coleman’s multiple roles before debuting as Clara proper. </p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">However, the Doctor did openly say that he would be popping back to the planet to visit again at some point. Regardless, it was interesting to see the next companion before we have to get used to them being around for the long haul next season.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="false">The news that Verada would play the next companion, alongside current companion Ruby, came in April 2024. The actress has previously appeared in Jurassic World Dominion and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68802766">has said</a> that it’s an ‘honour’ to be included in the cast of <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="255" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Mountain Dew x Final Fantasy XIV</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-ffxiv-x-mountain-dew-rewards-merch-and-how-to-redeem-points/">promotion</a> has taken the gaming world by storm, causing the birth of <a href="https://x.com/ColinRyan/status/1791190990868369802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memes</a> and discussion across the internet. However, one thing seems to be drawing more attention than anything else at the moment — Big Sippin.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Big Sippin is <em>Mountain Dew</em>’s in-game character mascot for the promotion. A level 81 (at the time of writing) Bard, dressed entirely in green and setting out on his adventures across Eorzea. Players have begun to <a href="https://x.com/MTNDEWGaming/status/1791202741248811209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obsessively stalk his FC house</a> (the FC is called House of Sippin, for those interested, and the house is located on Hyperion – Goblet, Ward 21, Plot 9 – if you want to join in the stalking), and <em>Mountain Dew</em> is sharing Big Sippin’s progress over on their Twitter page.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey gamers, Big Sippin is live in <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FF_XIV_EN</a> right now!</p><p>He’ll be at the Mtn Dew House for a bit, then heading out to start his FFXIV adventure. First up, Binding Coil of Bahamut! Log in and come along for the ride!</p><p>Maybe we’ll be dropping some Mtn Dew Gaming Reward codes…… <a href="https://t.co/KoNBfYRF0M">pic.twitter.com/KoNBfYRF0M</a></p></div>— Mountain Dew Gaming (@MTNDEWGaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/MTNDEWGaming/status/1791515347712921751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">However, one thing has drawn my attention (and the attention of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1cue35l/comment/l4i6o9u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few other players</a>) – Big Sippin, despite his lack of actually having played the game, appears to be a Legacy Player.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">For those who don’t know, to be considered a Legacy Player, the player must have played Final Fantasy XIV for at least 90 days prior to the Eighth Umbral Calamity and the release of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> back in 2013. This has raised some questions, and my love for researching strange events led me down a bit of a weird wormhole looking for answers.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="152" data-injectable="false">The reason that people are starting to think that Big Sippin might be a Legacy Player is down to two things which can be found on his <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/52996912/#profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lodestone profile</a>:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false"> <li>They have the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Cait_Sith_Doll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cait Sith Doll</a> minion, which was only ever available as a pre-order bonus for A Realm Reborn</li> <li>They have a <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Legacy_Chocobo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy Chocobo</a> mount, which is only owned by players who were around pre-A Realm Reborn</li> </ul> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">Now, I’m going to be honest and say that I’m 99% sure that Big Sippin is not a true Legacy Player. For starters, he only has three DoW/DoM Jobs unlocked (Bard at level 81, Sage at level 70, and Conjurer at level 22), and I’m wholly convinced that Bard has been level skipped in order to be used for <em>Mountain Dew</em>‘s promotional purposes. </p>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">The Soul Stone for Bard is green, so it fits the theme. Sage unlocks at level 70, so there’s no progression there and while it does look like Big Sippin has at least played a little as Conjurer, he hasn’t progressed far enough to gain his <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-equip-soul-crystal-job-stone-in-ffxiv/">Soul Stone</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="false">It’s more likely that this is a loaner account from Square Enix that was used for testing purposes or similar before A Realm Reborn was released. Or, if you want me to don my tin foil hat, this could just be a new account with a couple of red herring items added to spark conversation amongst players who look into it. If that’s the case, then I guess it worked because here we are.</p>
