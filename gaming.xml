            <p>A long-running zombie MMORPG you can play in your internet browser is shutting down next week, after almost 20 years of plank-smashing and supermarket looting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/urban-dead">Urban Dead</a> is closing down because a new UK law threatens hefty fines for online services (including games) that don't follow age restriction rules and other guidelines. It looks like making the game compliant with that law would be too much work for the solo web developer who's been keeping the apocalyptic servers going for this long. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Sad to have to announce that Urban Dead will be closing down on Friday 14 March 2025, due to an upcoming change in UK website legislation," said developer Kevan Davis in a <a href="https://www.urbandead.com/shutdown.html">post on the game's website</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/cult-text-based-zombie-mmo-urban-dead-is-shutting-down-after-a-full-19-years-8-months-and-11-days-because-of-new-uk-legislation/">Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p>"The Online Safety Act comes into force later this month, applying to all social and gaming websites where users interact, and especially those without strong age restrictions. With the possibility of heavy corporate-sized fines even for solo web projects like this one, I've reluctantly concluded that it doesn't look feasible for Urban Dead to be able to continue operating."</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act was passed into law in 2023 and comes into effect this year. The UK government says the act will make social media and search companies "more responsible for their users’ safety on their platforms."</p>
<p>"The strongest protections in the Act have been designed for children," an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">explainer says</a>. "Platforms will be required to prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content."</p>
<p>But the law has been criticised as a censor's charter by human rights groups <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/online-safety-bill-a-threat-to-human-rights-warn-campaigners/">such as Open Rights</a>, and big companies like Apple have complained that it has <a href="https://www.24zero.net/apple-calls-uks-online-safety-bill-a-serious-threat-to-end-to-end-encryption/">repercussions for end-to-end encryption</a>. This is a bit messy, since Apple is already in a spat with the UK government over <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rkpv50x01o">a secret order</a> they were handed by the government to hand over the keys to their encryption - but, look, none of this has anything to do with zombies. Urban Dead just seems to be collateral damage in a bigger legal brawl between the UK government and corporate interests.</p>
<p>"So a full 19 years, 8 months and 11 days after its quarantine began, Urban Dead will be shut down. No grand finale. No final catastrophe. No helicopter evac. Make your peace or your final stand in whichever part of Malton you called home, and the game will be switched off at noon UTC on 14 March."</p>
<p>Malton is the name of the big city you explore in the game. It's basically loads of blocks full of gun shops, fire stations, hospitals, malls, pubs, and other potential sources of useful items to scavenge. You can board up the windows of any building to protect against the undead. It's the only MMO I know that lets players play as zombies. I briefly wrote about waking up as a zombie and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-urban-dead">enjoying the game's refresh battles</a> back in 2017. I haven't played for many many years, but my fond memories of the game include holding out in a boarded up mall with lots of other players (and a single "pet" zombie player who muffled and groaned in <a href="https://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Guides:The_Zombie_Lexicon">a whole language that you could actually translate</a> if you took the time to examine the moans). </p>
<p>The developer doesn't write off a re-boot down the road. "If Urban Dead is ever revivified or spun off in any way in the future," says Davis on the Urban Dead news page, "it'll be announced on this website."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At a recent Assassin's Creed Shadows showcase event in Japan, Ubisoft Quebec Creative Director Jonathan Dumont discussed the estimated length of the upcoming open world game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1xnfk2J98Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Genki Gamer</a>, he said that the studio expects the main story to last at least thirty to forty hours, while the whole game could last more than eighty hours when accounting for all the side content.</p>
<p>That's certainly a hefty amount, although a bit less than the gargantuan Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which required 61 hours just for the main story and could last up to nearly 150 hours for a full completionist run, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/77729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the website HowLongToBeat</a>. Admittedly, Valhalla's quests and missions weren't always memorable, and gamers nowadays have loudly expressed their disdain for fetch quests and the like. Hopefully, the new installment can deliver higher quality content on average.</p>
<p>For Ubisoft, it would be an understatement to say that there's a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows. The French publisher had to deal with multiple underwhelming commercial launches, including Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, XDefiant, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. The shorter spin-off game Assassin's Creed Mirage did well enough, but now Ubisoft needs a big win. It's why they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows twice</a> in a desperate attempt to improve the game and make sure it hits the intended mark.</p>
<p>Bringing players to the long-requested setting of 16th-century Japan, toward the end of the Sengoku era, the game features dual protagonists Fujibayashi Naoe and Yasuke, a shinobi and a samurai, respectively. Ubisoft Quebec has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-lets-you-stick-with-one-protagonist-for-most-of-the-game-exploration-loop-is-sherlock-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that players could stick with their preferred protagonist for most of the game if they so choose, though there will be some things that one is much better at than the other, and at some point, the game might force you to switch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-off-the-improved-anvil-engine-shares-new-tech-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new version of the Anvil engine</a> delivers interesting improvements to the stealth gameplay, too. For the first time in the franchise, hiding in the shadows will actually make the player character invisible to their enemies. This means that during nighttime, every shaded spot will become a dynamic hiding spot in which the players can advance themselves further, both indoors and outdoors. Players can even destroy lit lanterns with Shurikens, creating new shadowed spots. Moreover, the dynamic weather and seasons can affect stealth as well. When it's raining, the sound covers the player's footsteps. Rain also makes changes to enemy patrols, as some NPCs will seek shelter from the rain. Seasons have an even greater effect, as some bushes/vegetation won't be there in the winter months.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to debut on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>I’ve only ever known the Suikoden&nbsp;series as the JRPG where you can recruit like a hundred different characters. I always loved the idea of that whenever I heard it, but the closest I came to actually playing them was with being tempted by the recently released spiritual successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/eiyuden-chronicles-hundred-heroes-review/">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a>. With Konami setting out to revive their entire gaming catalogue, though, it was only a matter of time before Suikoden was brought back into the spotlight. I’m thankful it was, and that this two-for-one HD remaster gave me the kick I needed to finally dive into a pair of unsurprising but thoroughly enjoyable old-school JRPGs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTLkLvgGvXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The amount of effort put into restoring and remastering these games for modern screens is immediately evident. These aren’t quite HD-2D works of art on the level of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest 3 Remake</a>,&nbsp;but they get pretty dang close. Plenty of environmental sprites has either been entirely redrawn or enhanced in 3D, with some realistic lighting or brightly glowing fires placed here and there in certain environments.</p>


<p>Despite characters being the focal point of this series, they don’t feel like they’ve gotten as much love in the process of remastering. Character sprites look nearly identical when compared to the original releases, retaining a pretty lanky &amp; blocky pixel aesthetic that ends up clashing just a bit with the much more modernised environments. Character portraits, meanwhile, are hit-or-miss. Those in Suikoden 1 have all been completely redrawn, and while some look pretty sharp many of them lack the same sharp style as the original portraits. Suikoden 2 portraits, meanwhile, are simply scaled up HD versions of the original portraits – but they’ve had a bit of their edge sanded off in the process, and a few even have bits of smudge and blur that come off looking pretty uncanny.</p>
<div id="attachment_457581"><p id="caption-attachment-457581">Suikoden 1 visual upgrade</p>
</div>
<p>The stories of these two games slot right into the classic fantasy formula. first game weaves a tale of an evil empire and a young hero poised to topple them with the help of his friends. The sequel, set a few years later, is a bit more open-ended as it follows childhood friends who get swept up in a series of fateful encounters and separations in the midst of a massive civil war. Both games, ultimately, steer you towards the same goal: recruit 108 allies to build an army big enough to conquer the big bad.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you’ll only be hanging out with up to six of your allies. Standard battles in the game are pretty traditional turn-based bouts where your crew of six occupy a set of rows based on their attack range, standing opposite enemies that have done the same. It’s pretty basic stuff, but these battles are broken up in a few refreshing ways. For these remasters new quality-of-life features let you toggle auto-battle or sped-up battles to help trudge through the slower sections of the game, but there’s also different battle types that you’ll be thrust into at times.</p>

		</div>

<p>Both games feature Duel battles where just two characters duke it out in a rock-paper-scissors combat format. It’s a really cool way to add some extra stakes to the more climactic encounters in the story. Then, there are War battles. In the first game, they’ kind of like scaled-up singular encounters from Advanced Wars. In the second game, though, War battles are massive turn-based tactical RPG bouts that really test your patience.</p>
<div id="attachment_457579"><p id="caption-attachment-457579">Suikoden 2 visual upgrade</p></div>
<p>In an otherwise basic set of JRPGs, I was constantly kept entertained and on my toes thanks to the features that make Suikoden&nbsp;such an iconic and unique series. Constantly encountering and recruiting hundreds of new allies was a thrill, and any time the slightly-basic story or combat started to overstay their welcome, an epic Duel battle or a massive War battle shook things up and got me right back into the thick of it.&nbsp;Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster&nbsp;doesn’t make these old-school titles feel like brand new games by any stretch, but it’s still a surprisingly polished and easily accessible way to dive into JRPG history.</p>

            <p>
Capcom has unveiled a bustling in-game event schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, with the first oppurtunity to gain new gear available now.
</p>
<p>
Six events will go live over the next three weeks, each lasting for a week or two, with rewards ranging from new headgear to... more cheese? I guess <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">Monster Hunter Wilds is really leaning into its cheese naan meme</a>.
</p>
<p>
The schedule begins now with Ku-Ku Gone Cuckoo, an event based in the Scarlet Forest which requires you gather special materials to obtain the Mimiphyta α headgear. This runs until 18th March.

<p>
The Stalking Supper event is also now active, which rewards you for gathering more Kunafa Cheese in Windward Plains to be used on your barbecue grill. This runs until 11th March.
</p>
<p>
Upcoming quests include Tongue-Tied, running from 11th-18th March, which involves gathering Armor Spheres, and then a trio of new events beginning on 18th March.
</p>
<p>
These include Ballet in the Rain, which involves gathering Glowing Orb - Swords, Sand-Scarred Soul, for gathering Glowing Orb - Armors, and Like A Fire Hidden By Sand, where Capcom says you can obtain "the Expedition Headgear α, a piece of equipment based on the emblem of the expedition!"
</p>
<p>
Capcom has a <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/event-quest/en-us/schedule?utc=0">full event schedule on the Monster Hunter Wilds website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom announced that Monster Hunter Wilds was its fastest-selling game ever</a>, with 8m copies shipped so far. The game also got its first big patch, though Capcom warned of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-warn-of-network-error-when-firing-sos-flares">continuing Monster Hunter Wilds network error  surrounding the use of SOS flares</a>.

			<p>A few hours ago, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1896969076884562078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has surpassed six million players, adding that such a scope is 'hard to comprehend' but the studio is 'incredibly thankful' to the community.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean six million users have purchased the game. That's because STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been available on Game Pass from day one, making it difficult to discriminate between real buyers and subscription users who found the game bundled in their library.</p>
<p>Still, it sounds like GSC Game World is happy enough so far. Moreover, while there has been no mention of a PlayStation 5 version, the console exclusivity <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is believed to be timed</a>. Eventually, STALKER 2 should also launch on Sony's console, opening up to a whole new audience.</p>
<p>The developer still has a long road ahead when it comes to post-launch support, anyway. The game should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to include hardware-enhanced ray tracing, official mod tools with cross-platform mod integration, and even a multiplayer mode, about which we know practically nothing so far. On top of those, there are also two upcoming expansions that were sold as part of the Season Pass, included with the Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The base game is well worth playing, if a bit too rough, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

            <p>A healthy pinch of my motivation for writing about waiter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> plate em' up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-way-of-the-tray">The Way Of The Tray</a> is so I can read your hospitality job horror stories in the comments, but I do love the energy here. It's a breathless, colourful (actual) plate-spinner that has you serve mythical dishes in the daily grind for tips from Yokai customers. You'll then invest those tips back into waiter skills and restaurant upgrades, or at least whatever petty cash is left over from paying rent.</p>

<p>I personally would not rely on the structural integrity of a layer of onigiri to support multiple clay bowls and glass bottles, but I am not a professional, nor do I have to please a clientele of demons, large spiders, and Kappas. I also personally wouldn't have written the phrase "immerse yourself in the mysterious atmosphere of Japan" in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373830/The_Way_of_the_Tray_Japanese_Restaurant_Simulator/">Steam features</a>, since all you have to do there is add an '-ese folklore' to not sound like a 17th century powder-wigged buffoon trotting out his maid in Geisha makeup for tonight's dinner party entertainment. Here are some less irksomely worded features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master the art of keeping your tray balanced: every mistake can cost you a tip. Learn to manage your time so you can serve all your guests on time and prevent them from leaving.</li>
<li>Serve unusual orders to yokai and learn all the secrets of local cuisine.</li>
<li>Develop your waiter skills to earn more tips and invest them in upgrades, and don’t forget to pay the rent.</li>
</ul>
<p>My own experience in food service includes frying up English breakfasts in a chippy cafe, temping for a catering company for weddings, and working in a Wetherspoons-grade pub kitchen (I believe the professional term is "microwave ape"). None of these were especially negative, mind. The chippy was in a popular holiday town, which led me to observe that some customers will treat any perceived imperfection as a direct assault on their perfect getaway, but I suppose the nature of limited leisure time makes solipsists of us all. As does paying six quid for a bacon roll. If I'd known you were going to be a Kappa I would have whacked extra cucumber in there, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/75Ec8tj1T1Y0mqJTLVE4fD/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-hideout">new blogvert</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' hideout customisation appeared yesterday, just when you thought it was safe to play another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> following the merciless time vacuum that was<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth"> Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>'s Dondoko Island.</p>
<p>The hideout is an acre of "fully customisable" land for Naoe and Yasuke to visit for a breather.  Once there, you can pop down buildings, shrubbery, animals, and decorations. The blog also specifies the placement of "mossy rocks". No other types though. Moss or piss off.</p>

<p>Here's some grid snapping action.</p>

<p>"Each building &amp; upgrade will also have a direct impact on gameplay," the blog says. The dojo trains combat allies. The forge upgrades weapons. A tea room lets you "increase ration efficiency", and so on. I assume that's something to do with health, although I'm now picturing a radical late nineties console advert in which a spiky-haired youth shouts downstairs at his parents that he can't go to grandma's house because he's "increasing ration efficiency, Mom!". Nothing says excitement like upgrade names that evoke board room minutes.</p>

<p>As you can see above, the grid snapping action also applies to animal companions, who you can pop down and visit to pet at your leisure. "We had all these endearing critters all over the world already," writes Dany of the senior design team, "and everyone's instant reaction is to drop everything they're doing and stare at them for a minute. It made sense for us to make them available inside of the Hideout."</p>
<p>This isn't entirely accurate to my experience with Assassin's Creed, since I actually spent a good chunk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Odyssey</a> on a personal quest to find every bear in Greece and kick them in the face. Call me out for being an awful cynic here, but this also feels like a case of "give the player what they think they want" at the expense of those moments Dany describes. I'm not sure how often I'd stop and to stare at wildlife in the open world if I've already got a hideout carpeted in deer poo.</p>
<p>To further populate, upgrade, and decorate your hideout, the open world is scattered with resources for you to collect - or possibly pay for since it's Assassin's Creed, a pioneer in the groundbreaking "give us a tenner for this bag of wood" monetisation field.</p>
<p>This is purely speculation on my part, however. Ubisoft have already announced they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">dropping the season pass model</a>, although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">Steam listing</a> does offer a pricier edition that includes some DLC, so this feels more like a token rebranding than the (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">currently flailing</a>) company turning over a new mossy rock.</p>
<p>I'm aware that I'm emanating pessimism like a <a href="https://freshare.net/persimmon-seeds-predict-warm-winter-above-average-snow-fall-in-the-ozarks-freshare-net/">snow hater dissecting a spoon-shaped persimmon seed</a>, so I should say that I think this all sounds like a pleasant and serene way to spend time between the hustle and/or bustle of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sengoku">Sengoku</a> period. A few customisation tools go a long way in helping you feel ownership over a space, and I'm a sucker for anything that lets me enjoy the vibe of pruning a bonsai without the anguish of having that bonsai die approximately fourteen seconds after I bring it home. Also, I like the sound of the ally conversations at the hideout:</p>
<p>"Having our allies in one place creates opportunities for character development," the blog says. "We gathered the writers (from 4 different studios all over the world) in a meeting and had them create interactions inspired by questions like, 'What would happen if these two characters suddenly became roommates?' I really love all the cool little moments they came up with. It makes the Hideout feel like the beating heart of the league".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation has been hit with more layoffs from its Visual Arts studio, following the recent cancellations of multiple live-service games.</p>
<p>The layoffs come amid a restructuring of Sony's US studios, as an unknown number of staff from the San Diego-based Visual Arts studio will be let go this week.</p>
<p>Visual Arts supported first-party development (including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us remasters), and while these new cuts include staff who contributed to the recently cancelled live-service game from Bend Studio among others, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734">Kotaku</a> has reported the layoffs are more widespread.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for further details on these layoffs.</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">several cancelled projects from Sony</a>, including a live-service game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and another from Bluepoint reportedly based within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony cancelled live-service shooter Concord</a> back in September, admitting "our initial launch didn't land".

<p>On the flipside, Sony still has its Horizon live-service game in development, which has now added former Bungie senior design lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjamesproctor/">Chris Proctor</a> to its team as a design director.

			<p>Back in the late 90s, after releasing some amazing games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, Squaresoft was the undisputed king of Japanese role-playing games. The publisher's dominance in the genre, however, did not stop other Japanese publishers known for releasing some absolute bangers in other genres from launching their own takes on the genre, like Konami, which released the first entry in the Suikoden series back in late 1995 in Japan. While the game directed by Yoshitaka Murayama wasn't particularly different from most traditional JRPGs, it set itself apart from the competition by tackling some pretty mature themes for the time, but the rise of polygonal 3D graphics, and a Western release date too close to that of Final Fantasy VII severely impacted the game's audience. No one at the time, however, could have predicted that the game would turn into a full-blown series, counting five main entries and a few spin-offs that would attract a loyal and enduring following, even after the series was clearly done.</p>
<p>While the series' creator Yoshitaka Murayama, who sadly passed away <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-series-creator-eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-scenario-writer-yoshitaka-murayama-has-passed-away/">last year</a>, moved on to create <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review-the-last-bow/">another franchise</a> that serves as a spiritual successor to the Konami series, Konami has finally decided to bring back the series after a very long hiatus and offer modern audiences a chance to play both the original Suikoden and Suikoden II on modern platforms with Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster collection that does its job quite well, but whose real value lies in the quality of the original games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250221183259_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For those who have already played the two games, let's get one thing out of the way: Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is a competent remaster that, maybe, could have done something more. Both games have received a considerable visual uplit, as every location has been faithfully recreated over the original games with higher resolution art and sprites, which have been left untouched over the original aside from receiving an obvious resolution bump, and new animated elements that help bring the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowstone to life like never before. Character portraits have been completely redone in Suikoden I to bring them to a similar level of quality as those featured in Suikoden II, which have received some light touch-ups but no major overhaul. The soundtrack of both games was left untouched, which is not a bad thing at all, considering how amazing they both are to this day, and the only proper improvement in the audio department is ambient noises, which add a little bit of color to the entire game and help immersion, especially in the many dramatic sequences where music is absent.</p>
<p>In addition to the visual uplift and the small audio improvements, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars features a few other enhancements, including a redone UI for both games, which is quite welcome, three difficulty options, and some other quality-of-life changes, including the ability to speed up battles, and a toggleable auto-battle option that allows players to either play multiple turns using the auto option or cancel it to input commands manually the following turn. While the difficulty options are welcome, and Hard difficulty can be a little challenging, especially at the beginning of the two games, where the player has limited resources and lacks access to the most powerful Stars of Destiny, the other two combat improvements leave something to be desired. Speeding up battles essentially speeds the entire game up, meaning that you will also have to listen to sped-up versions of the combat themes, which is so bad that I avoided using the option as much as I could, something that did not impact the experience too much since both Suikoden I and Suikoden II feature a snappy combat system that doesn't waste too much time playing out characters' actions. The new Auto Battle feature, on the other hand, is way more useful, but unfortunately, activating it forces a small black bar on the lower part of the screen that indicates Auto Battle is on, which is a little distracting and immersion-breaking. One final extremely welcome quality of life improvement exclusive to Suikoden II is the Turn Off EVen TImer option, which removes the time limit for certain events, such as Clive's sidequest.</p>
<p>The biggest improvement besides the improved visuals featured in Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars are the localization improvements. While the English localization was overall fine in the original game, though not stellar in any capacity, it was truly awful in Suikoden II, featuring some repeated dialogues, poor wording, and sentence structure that sometimes made it difficult to even understand what characters were saying. Both games have received a new English localization that flows much better in the first game, and that finally makes sense in the second game, making the story shine even more than it did back in the day, even with the horrible localization and all. Unfortunately, there are times when modern slang slips in that feels completely out of place, such as when Viktor calls Gremio a "drama queen" early in Suikoden I, but thankfully they aren't that frequent.</p>
<p>While the above is a solid selection of improvements, as I got reacquainted with the Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, I couldn't help but feel that something more could have been done, aside from fixing the music speeding up in battle when increasing combat speed. For starters, an option to speed up field traversal would have been welcome, as would a random encounter toggle. While the two games don't have a high random encounter rate, the way they handle fighting weak enemies, who can be Let Go at the start of any turn without any penalty, it just would have made sense to give players the option to turn encounters off completely to speed up the already excellent pace of both games. With so many playable characters available, any option to improve character management would also have been welcome, especially in Suikoden I.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303011312_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even though something more could have been done to improve the two games, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is still a collection that every JRPG should be getting for a very simple reason: the high quality of both games. While the original Suikoden may feel a little too traditional, even with some of its unique quirks, Suikoden II is, simply put, one of the best Japanese role-playing games ever released, taking everything the original game did and bringing it up to eleven. In my opinion, it stands head-to-head with more popular JRPGs of the late 90s, like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, and Xenogears, and even surpasses them in some areas. It is a game that every fan of the genre should experience at least once.</p>
<p>At a glance, Suikoden I and its sequel don't look that different. Both are traditional top-down 2D JRPGs where players explore the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowston as the story dictates, alternating between towns and villages and dungeons as required. While both experiences are fairly linear, their traditional world maps sometimes allow players to branch out in search of new companions to recruit, the 108 of Destiny, who can join the main, mandatory story characters in battles, or provide significant help during Army Battles, which are played as some sort of rock-paper-scissor game in the first Suikoden and as a tactical turn-based RPG in the second, or new services at the Headquarters. The straightforward turn-based combat system is made more remarkable by the large parties of up to six members, the ability to use combinations attacks with certain characters called Unite Attacks, and its general fast speed. At some point during both games, certain characters will also be involved in duels, one-on-one fights that employ a rock-paper-scissor system and feature a sort of cinematic feel that looks great even with the dated and simple 3D backgrounds. Enriching both games are dungeons with a solid design featuring some puzzles, a decent wealth of mini-games that provide some variety, though the RNG dice game Chinchirorin remains as annoying as ever.</p>
<p>What truly makes Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars stand out even today with their relatively straightforward gameplay are their stories, which were, in many ways, groundbreaking for the time. Even with its relative simplicity, Suikoden I laid the thematic groundwork that would get further developed in its sequel, not shying away, as already mentioned, from dealing with some pretty dark and mature themes like the reality of war, often shown without any sort of filter, prejudice, and racism, duty, honor and sacrifice transcending every bond.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250302235643_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Suikoden II goes even deeper with these themes, featuring some chilling sequences that get etched into the player's memory and heart, all the while, much like its predecessor, balancing them out with considerably less dark sequences. What makes Suikoden II the best entry in the series and one of the best JRPGs of all time, elevating it past its already solid predecessor is its cast. The incredible main trio of protagonists - the main character, Nanami and Jowy -, the way their personal stories intertwine not only with the war between the City-States of Jowston and the Highland Kingdom but also with the overarching series' story of the 27 True Runes and the personal conflicts of other story-significant characters are a massive highlight of the experience, and how they get resolved, no matter the ending reached, are capable of moving pretty much anyone who has the chance of experiencing them first hand. All of this is massively improved by the incredible and diverse soundtrack, whose standout piece, the beautifully melancholic Reminiscence, is only the tip of the audio iceberg.</p>
<p>But if there is one character that is the true standout of the Suikoden II cast is one of the main villains, the infamous Mad Prince of the Highland Kingdom, Luca Blight. This psychopath, who can only be described as a demon in human skin, is rightly considered one of the best villains ever seen in JRPG, and for good reason, surpassing other known JRPG madmen like Kefka and Sephiroth by engaging in the most heinous of war crimes only because he had the authority and the power to do so, all while delivering some unforgettable speeches that truly send shivers down the spine. Going against the tendency of the time, which still holds true today, to make JRPG villains grey, the absolute evil that Luca Blight shows whenever he appears on screen, and even offscreen at times, is a refreshing breath of air nowadays, a testament of the genius and courage of Yoshitaka Murayama and the entire writing team.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars definitely succeeds at updating the two classic JRPGs while staying faithful to the original games' art direction, although a few more options and quality-of-life features wouldn't have hurt. Even if the remaster somehow failed to deliver a quality updgrade, however, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars would have been a worthy purchase for any JRPG. The two classic games have stood the test of time incredibly well and still provide extremely compelling gameplay enriched by charming casts and thought-provoking stories that are still worthy of experiencing in 2025 as they were back in the late 90s.</p>

				<p>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars is an excellent update to the first two entries in the series, enhancing their timeless appeal with improved visuals that breathe new life into the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowstone, along with an improved English localization. While a few additional quality-of-life features would have been welcome, the excellent, thought-provoking stories and charming cast make this collection a must-have for both newcomers and longtime fans. It took decades for Suikoden to make a proper return, but Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars was well worth the long wait.</p>

<p>“For the original games, the size of the dialogue box was quite small and there wasn’t a lot that we could fit in there," producer Yasuo Daikai <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-interview-suikoden-hd-remaster">told IGN back in 2022</a>. "Japanese is a language that can say a lot in a very short amount of space, but for English and other languages, you need a lot of space to say the same thing usually. So in this game we have expanded the size of those dialogue boxes, and that has let us retool and work on the localization to get us more in tune with the Japanese script,"</p>

<p>I wasn't able to check all or even most of the dialogue, instead pausing occasionally to compare the remasters to footage of the Playstation originals. But most lines I did compare are different. It's a fine translation, but one that sometimes sacrifices idiosyncratic character for what feels like cautious legibility. Considering how difficult these games are to own legally, my ideal package would have been one that preserved the original scripts in some form.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the stilted becomes the colloquial in ways that feel sensible and deft. Viktor's "Prepare yourselves for a surprise" from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> 1 is now "you might wanna sit down for this". Sometimes, the poetic becomes more commonplace. "Not that I see our reunion in the stars," Leknaat tells the hero in the original. "Not based on an astrology reading," she says now. Odessa's "Our tiny newborn hope must be kept alive" is now "that small flame of hope must be kept alive."</p>
<p>Other changes are more subjective, depending on how much you like Suikoden's goofiness, but seem clear examples of extra space being used. Instead of the hero having the option to tell Emperor Barbarossa "I don't wanna", he can now say "not if I can help it".</p>
<p>I've only played a little of Suikoden 2 at time of writing, but every line I compared in the introduction is slightly different. Again, these strike me as a translator using the extra space that Daikai mentioned to craft more precise lines. Jowy's "Me too. I thought about going back to Kyaro and I couldn't wait to get out of that uniform" is now "Me too, actually. No way I could stay in that uniform any longer knowing we're headed home to Kyaro." Luca Blight's "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that old man. I'm getting rusty" is now "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that stupid old man. I'm falling out of practise."</p>

<p>Since review embargo is up, I can tell you I'm having a lovely time revisiting two games that are precious to me beyond words (which is awkward because I have to write about them). There are also plenty of features in support of preservation: music, cutscene, and cinematic galleries with concept art backgrounds. There's no lack of love or care here. Suikoden I character designer Junko Kawano's new portraits are a real treat, especially. But - speaking purely in terms of preservation - there's something irreplaceable about a fourteen year old answering an emperor's request with "I don't wanna", and I'd have loved to see an original translation menu toggle.</p>
<p>(Yes - the dragons still sound like elephants.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-will-last-80-hours-with-side-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-will-last-%E2%80%98above-80-hours%E2%80%99-with-side-content.1125624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-will-last-80-hours-with-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed by the creative director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows that the game will last more than 80 hours if you’re pursuing all the side content available. The base campaign will last around 30 to 40 hours, depending on your playstyle, but that extra meat on the bones more than <strong>doubles </strong>what’s available.</p>



<p>This is a similar tactic employed in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which is the longest Assassin’s Creed game, thanks to the sheer amount of side activities and expansions. Those hoping for a slimmer experience akin to that found in 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage are out of luck – but we kind of knew that.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-expansive">Expansive</h2>



<p>In an interview with Genki, Jonathan Dumont explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is nothing short of expansive.</p>



<p>If the campaign being 30 – 40 hours long wasn’t enough, the side content will bring up your total playtime to around 80 hours, depending on your style. If <strong>that </strong>wasn’t enough, the team at Ubisoft is also looking at adding New Game+ and ‘other modes’ based on post-launch feedback.</p>



<p>The full breakdown <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1896738405993865410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Genki</a> on social media included several tidbits of information about the upcoming game, which launches later this month. The ‘vast, dynamic, breathing open world’ will be populated by recruitable characters, minigames, and dynamic world elements like a weather system and day-night cycle.</p>



<p>By all accounts, Assassin’s Creed Shadows seems like a solid title, but it’ll need to be something special to pull Ubisoft out of the rut it finds itself in. The game has proven to be a controversial one in the months leading up to its release, but Jonathan Dumont pointed out that the developers are more interested in ‘delivering an outstanding game.’</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-barber-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2%E2%80%99s-barber-mode-update-detailed-in-livestream.1125612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-barber-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Warhorse Studios recently hosted a livestream that touched on the future of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The game, which might be my GOTY, was released in February to an overwhelmingly positive reception, turning heads worldwide. Midway through March, the ‘Barber Mode’ will be added to the game in the first of a long list of major updates.</p>



<p>During the stream, the team at Warhorse Studios revealed some of the hairstyles and facial hair sets coming to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with the Barber Update, which doesn’t have a confirmed release date at present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changing-henry">Changing Henry</h2>



<p>Henry of Skalitz, the game’s protagonist, has aged since the first title, but he’s still a <strong>bit </strong>of a babyface. When the Barber Mode update arrives, that’ll change, as players will have the option to adorn the medieval adventurer in a beard and mullet if they so desire.</p>



<p>The full suite of beards, moustaches, goatees, and hairstyles was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1izqgrp/kcd2_beardstyles_from_the_new_barber_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">captured by eagle-eyed users on Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>The team at Warhorse Studios also took time to dive into the ‘Hardcore Mode’ update that’s also on the horizon. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 represents a realistic and challenging experience, but the Hardcore Mode will take things to the next level.</p>



<p>With this punishing setting enabled, players will lose most of their UI, enemies will be tougher, fast travel will be locked, and your position will never be shown on the map. It might be one of the most immersive ways to play the game, but it’s guaranteed to be stressful for even the most talented gamer.</p>



<p>The Barber Mode will be the first in a long line of releases coming to expand the world of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Last month, the team at Warhorse Studios revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major DLCs</a> coming throughout the year.</p>



<p>Are you eager to change Henry’s look in KCD2 with the Barber Mode update? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed that Tencent had made further investment in FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa. The move, which has been labelled ‘part of a capital business alliance between the submitter and the issuer’, brings Tencent’s stake in Kadokawa to 7.97%. For a point of reference, Sony’s stake is just 10%.</p>



<p>The additional stake represented a 1.1% increase in Tencent’s investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-key-strategies">Key Strategies</h2>



<p>Tencent is one of the biggest players in the gaming space, which is hardly a secret. The super-sized gaming titan has fingers in many pies and investments across the board, giving the company a foothold in almost every corner of the gaming world.</p>



<p>The latest investment into Kadokawa means very little in the grand scheme of things, and it’s a humble sum compared to some of Tencent’s more recent investments. The news was confirmed recently by <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC038QE0T00C25A3000000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei</a>, a Japanese outlet.</p>



<p>For example, in 2022, Tencent’s stake in Ubisoft increased from 4.5% to 9.99%, an increase of more than 50%.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Tencent owns 99% of Riot Games, 84% of Supercell, 40% of Epic Games, and around 10% of KRAFTON.</p>



<p>In December, Kadokawa was in the news after rumours surfaced suggesting that Sony was fielding an intention to acquire the company. This turned out to be an investment rather than a full buyout, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-alliance-kadokawa/">Sony formed a ‘strategic alliance’</a> with the company, securing 10% of the firm’s shares.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-season-20-coming-march-18/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout 76’s <strong>20th season </strong>arrives on March 18, and it has been dubbed ‘Glow of the Ghoul’. This is in recognition of the most critical element of this new season – players can finally become a ‘ghoul’ character in the game. This long-awaited change was revealed several months ago, and when Glow of the Ghoul finally arrives on March 18, it’ll be available in-game.</p>



<p>Fallout 76 Season 20 will run from March through to June, and plenty of events and limited-time offers are popping up over the next few months, including an all-new event called ‘The Big Bloom’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-glow-of-the-ghoul">Fallout 76 – Glow of the Ghoul</h2>



<p>Glow of the Ghoul ushers in one of the most dramatic changes to the post-apocalyptic MMORPG in recent years. Players will be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-ghoul-character-meta-change/">turn into a ghoul</a>, soaking up radiation and altering their image, biochemistry, and abilities – but don’t worry, the change can be reverted if you don’t enjoy the new build.</p>



<p>On March 20, Bethesda Game Studios is kicking off a ghoul-based photo mode contest to see which characters look the best with this new build base.</p>



<p>Here’s the full calendar for Fallout 76 Season 20:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Big Bloom starts on April 29 and runs to May 13. This new limited-time event is one of the first seasonal events to be added to the game in a very long time, as the calendar typically portrays a rinse-and-repeat model of prior events. That’s true here, but The Big Bloom is a nice addition to the rotation.</p>



<p>Of course, a new season also means a stack of new items in the Atomic Shop, so it’ll be worth keeping an eye open with the resets to see what pops up. This season is all about toxicity, radiation, and disease – which is probably more exciting than it sounds.</p>



<p>Here’s a short trailer promoting Fallout 76 Season 20:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 20: Glow of the Ghoul" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvfVn-bvQkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Bethesda Game Studios is doing a great job of keeping the fires stoked in Fallout 76, but some players have criticised the Season 20 update on social media. Aside from the new ghoul transformation – which not everyone will take advantage of – Fallout 76 Season 20 offers very little in the way of changes.</p>



<p>Typically, Fallout 76 has one or two major updates a year, and while this fairly dramatic change is a series first and quite a milestone for Fallout fans, it’s not <strong>exactly </strong>what fans were hoping to see for the game’s <strong>twentieth season</strong>.</p>



<p>Will you be turning into a ghoul when Fallout 76 Season 20 launches on March 18? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/deliver-at-all-costs-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/steam-next-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Next Fest</a> is probably the only time I play demos these days, partly because there are simply too many games on Steam and I couldn't get around to most of them even if I wanted to, but also because I'm not someone who normally likes to partake in a game before it's done.</p><p>I don't like to dabble! I don't want to eat two slices of pizza in the car then the rest on the couch; I like to get home, put my feet up, put a movie on, get in the mood <em>then </em>eat all the pizza.&nbsp;</p><p>With demos though, as with everything else in life, there are exceptions, and mine normally come in two forms: sandboxy games where the demo is just letting me kick some tyres for a minute (<a href="https://aftermath.site/islands-and-trains-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Islands And Trains</em></a>), and demos like <em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, where I don't care that I'm having the intro and some missions spoiled early because I'm simply not paying attention to them.</p><p><em>Deliver At All Costs </em>is an isometric game where you drive a car around running errands and making deliveries. As an isometric-enjoyer I'm a huge fan of the perspective as it is, but this game's party trick isn't its viewpoint, it’s the carnage. For whatever reason--and I don't know if the game's narrative will support this, or if anyone will care--but <em>Deliver At All Cost's </em>world is almost <em>fully </em>destructible.</p><p>Look at this!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Deliver At All Costs - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUAafYY32A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Looks fun, right? It <em>is </em>fun. You can download this demo, install it and within minutes be fishtailing a 50s pickup through someone's house before crushing a fence and flattening a whole row of trees. Not for any reason, just because you can.</p><p>I could and should be telling you everything else about the game now, what the rest of the demo was like, its story and structure, but to be honest I have no idea. Every time I've booted this up I've made one right turn out of a garage and just started driving into everything I see.</p><p>Which is fine, it's a demo. The nuance and meat of this game is the pizza, which I'm sure I'll make time for later down the line when this is done. Lights out, whole thing at once, yada yada. For now, as a demo, I just want to wreck shit, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and for as long as the demo is still available</a>, you should too.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible"><h3>Gundam GQuuuuuuX Is The Sum Of Its Parts In The Best Way Possible</h3></a><p>The new Mobile Suit Gundam is FLCL, Pokémon, and a hint of Evangelion</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">March has started off with a bang if you're still roaming the streets of Los Santos in GTA Online. Along with the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/">Enhanced Edition that arrived for PC players</a>, Rockstar Games also launched a new set of missions and released a plethora of additional content. The new missions fall under the name "Oscar Guzman Flies Again," and there are six of them in total. They take place at the infamous McKenzie Field Hangar and see you steal arms deliveries from Oscar's competition.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to get started with these missions and make some serious cash from the McKenzie Hangar, check out the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to start the Oscar Guzman Flies Again Missions in GTA Online</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453986" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453986"></a><figcaption>Oscar Guzman calling to tell us about his new idea</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, PC players need to ensure they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/" data-ref-id="1100-6529782">migrate their GTA Online character</a> correctly before attempting to pick up right where they left off after downloading the Enhanced Edition. This is easily done by selecting the GTA Online in the main menu and then following the prompts to migrate your character(s). This process is permanent, but there's no real reason you don't want to migrate your progress in either Online or Story Mode.</p><p dir="ltr">New players picking up GTA Online for the first time can simply download the Enhanced Edition and create a new character. However, if you're a new player, you'll have to go through a long slog of required tasks and missions before you're able to partake in the Oscar Guzman missions.</p><p dir="ltr">When you're in Los Santos, you can either go to MazeBank Foreclosures on your phone or wait for a call from Oscar Guzman. It's preferable to wait for Oscar to call you so he can properly explain what he wants you to do, but if you visit MazeBank Foreclosures, click on the red "McKenzie Field Hangar" box.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453984"></a><figcaption>Choosing to buy the McKenzie Field Hangar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From here, go to the northern side of Los Santos, find the property's blue icon, and elect to purchase the property for $1.475 million. If you wait for Oscar to call, he'll tell you to do the same thing, so you're buying the property regardless.</p><p dir="ltr">After McKenzie Field Hangar is purchased, you'll receive another call from Oscar who asks you to go visit the property. This is quite a drive from downtown Los Santos, but you can simply reload your server to instantly go to the location.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you arrive at the hangar, hop out inside and Oscar will greet you. He'll explain that he's happy you bought the property and goes over his plans for what you're going to do. After a brief conversation, you're led inside to the office where you can register as a CEO on the laptop on the desk. With that done, you can accept the first job in the Oscar Guzman Flies Again missions, which is called "Up and Running."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453985" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453985"></a><figcaption>Speaking with Oscar Guzman at the hangar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You've now officially begun your first of six missions for Oscar Guzman in GTA Online. Up and Running doesn't take too long, but it can be difficult as a solo player, so if you have some friends or want to open up your party, that's recommended. However, all of the missions for Oscar Guzman can be completed solo.</p>

            <p>
Dotemu and Guard Crush Games, the studios behind 2020's widely acclaimed beat 'em up sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, are teaming up again for something a little bit different: Absolum, a fantasy themed side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like elements that's launching this year.
</p>
<p>
Absolum aims to combine "thrilling arcade beat 'em up action" with "intricate, refined combat" to create what Dotemu is describing as a "rogue 'em up". There's talk of quests, branching pathways, NPCs, unlockable items, permanent warrior upgrades, and combinable character skills - all in a fantasy adventure channeling the spirit of classic brawlers including Golden Axe.
</p>
<p>
Absolum's action plays out across Talamh, a world of wonder and cosmic horrors gripped by warfare following a cataclysmic magical event. That's where the game's four-strong band of rebels comes in, all setting out on an epic quest to oppose the Sun King Azra and liberate Talamh after they're imbued with powerful magic.

<p>
All four rebels are playable (either solo or co-operatively) and feature their own unique skill set and personality, with two having been revealed so far. There's Galandra, for instance - an agile, sword-clad fighter designed to excel in close-quarters combat - while Karl is a tanklike dwarf armed with devastating punches and a rifle that can bring down opponents from afar.
</p>
<p>
"Absolum blends arcade-like melee combat with spells, counters, upgradable abilities and uniquely powerful playable fighters," explains Dotemu, "hosting a grand, high-stakes quest across an array of hand-crafted stages." Those stages - and Absolum's striking visual style - have been brought to life by the artists and animators at animation studio Supamonks.
</p>
<p>
Absolum doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">via Steam</a>) sometime later this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Rockstar has released the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V PC update</a>, which the developer dubbed GTA V Enhanced. This free update is effectively a new version of the game, as you can check in your Steam or Epic Games Store library, where the previous version is now labeled as GTA V Legacy. The distinction makes sense, as the new version has much higher system requirements compared to the original version.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 10 (latest service pack)<br>
Processor: Intel Core i7-4770 | AMD FX-9590<br>
Memory: 8 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 (4GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6400 (4GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: DirectX 10 Compatible<br>
Additional Notes: SSD Required |*Compatible PC and/or device required. 3D Audio via Windows Spatial Sound compatible audio systems</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 11<br>
Processor: Intel Core i5-9600K | AMD Ryzen 5 3600<br>
Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (8GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6600XT (8GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: Windows Spatial Sound-compatible audio system; solution containing Dolby Atmos support required for a Dolby Atmos experience<br>
Additional Notes: SSD with DirectStorage compatibility</p>
<p>It's also important to make sure your configuration is up for it since progress can be copied from the Legacy version once, and while you will be able to continue playing from where you left off in GTA V Legacy, progress cannot be copied back. This goes for both Story Mode and GTA Online progress, including Characters, GTA$, Progression, Stats, Vehicles, Properties, Weapons, Clothing, and Player-Created Jobs.</p>
<p>Let's review the bulk of the new features available in GTA V Enhanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing support, including reflections and shadows (previously released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) and the PC-exclusive global illumination and ambient occlusion</li>
<li>Upscaling support for AMD FSR 1 and 3 and NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>Faster load times powered by DirectStorage support</li>
<li>Enhanced 3D audio with support for Dolby Atmos (for those with compatible sound systems) and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers feature, which is enabled to let the player feel directional damage, weather effects, rough road surfaces, explosions, and more</li>
<li>General optimization</li>
</ul>

</figure>


<p>First things first. Rockstar still didn't add support for High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) displays, which is underwhelming in 2025. The NVIDIA App does not recognize the new version yet, and therefore, tweaking the ApplicationStorage.json file to implement the new DLSS 4 transformer models is not possible. At least Rockstar added built-in support for DLAA, which can be selected directly in-game.</p>
<p>Each ray tracing setting (shadows, reflections, global illumination, and ambient occlusion) can be individually enabled and set up to Ultra. There's also an extra setting called Scene BVH Quality, which maxes out at Very High. Those are the only new settings in the graphics menu. For the testing on my rig (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition), I pushed every setting to the max, including High-Resolution Shadows and Extended Shadows Distance.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA V Enhanced 4K DLAA RT Maxed Gameplay - RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cMF8tgUvrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After jumping into the game, the visual upgrade over the vanilla version of Grand Theft Auto V was immediately clear. By far the two most impactful enhancements are ray traced global illumination and reflections, which literally elevate the graphics of most scenes to an entirely new level of fidelity. Of course, when you look closely, you can still see that the models and textures are from a relatively old game. For that, you'll need to use mods, though that might only fly for the single-player mode now that Rockstar has <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the kernel-level anti-cheat BattlEye to combat cheating in GTA Online.</p>
<p>Still, there's no doubt that GTA V Enhanced is the best the game has ever looked. On the aforementioned rig, the game also runs smoothly, even without Frame Generation (which should be added in a future update, said Rockstar), reaching 123 average frames per second in a free-roaming session of around 20 minutes. Support for NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation could potentially triple this result. I would be particularly interested in bumping these 1% low and 0.1% Low to get a more consistent experience, though.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-04-224951-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>GTA V Enhanced is definitely a way to entice players to get back into the game just as GTA VI looms on the horizon, but one could also take it as a positive sign for the next game's PC version, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch sooner than expected in early 2026. Support for modern features like ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS/AMD FSR (and soon Frame Generation), Dolby Atmos, and the DualSense controller is a step in the right direction for a developer that has too often relegated PC users to second-class citizens, as evidenced by the huge delay of this 'Next-Gen' update compared to consoles.</p>
<p>However, there's still work to do. For example, whether you own the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store, you still need to pass through the dreaded Rockstar Games Launcher and this affects the DLSS version, too, since the Launcher replaces the DLSS file with the default version if you've updated it to a newer one. Thankfully, there's already a mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/gta5/mods/1199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on the Nexus</a> that monitors the GTA V Enhanced process and replaces the DLSS file automatically when the game is started, restoring it to the original upon quitting the game. This is exactly the kind of stuff that annoys PC gamers; Rockstar should take note for GTA VI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-twitch-ban-rick-scott-medicare-medicaid<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, the biggest leftist political streamer and one of the few progressive voices to rival the right’s small army of endlessly-aggrieved attack dogs, was suspended from Twitch. The cause? During a broadcast last week, Piker suggested that if House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans were as serious about Medicare and Medicaid fraud as they claim, they would “kill Rick Scott,” a current senator and former CEO who oversaw what <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2003/June/03_civ_386.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Department of Justice called</a> “the largest health care fraud case in US history,” instead of elevating him to the upper echelons of the party. This is notable not because of Piker’s suspension, but because of how people – especially other content creators – ended up framing the larger issue.</p><p>Not long after Piker made his incendiary statement last week, the outrage machine kicked into overdrive, with the likes of <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/libs-tiktok/bomb-threats-follow-libs-tiktoks-campaign-against-planet-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actual-violence-encourager Libs of TikTok</a> and rebranded <em>WoW </em>streamer Asmongold – who unsurprisingly <a href="https://x.com/gremloe/status/1890592255947190624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did <em>not </em>turn over a new leaf</a> following his own suspension for <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2024 racist rant against Palestinians</a> – <a href="https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1895556175284036051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clutching</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oqp5_ZYLXs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their pearls</a> at what they suggested was a violent threat against Scott. Numerous others across Twitter and YouTube – some connected to <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a longer-term effort to deplatform Piker and other pro-Palestine streamers</a>, others not –&nbsp; took up their cause, and Twitch suspended Piker a few days later.</p><p>After just one day, Piker’s suspension has concluded, and other usual suspects like Tim Pool are <a href="https://x.com/Timcast/status/1896982287692259588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acting like</a> Twitch is turning a blind eye to murder. Never mind that even Piker did not suggest viewers should harm Scott. He remarked that Johnson and other high-ranking Republicans <em>would </em>do it if they stood by their stated principles, an idea so far outside the realm of possibility as to be on its face absurd.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="i got cancelled." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmzLMjCbLXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"My statement was hyperbolic,” Piker said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmzLMjCbLXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a YouTube video</a> addressing the suspension today. “But the intention of it was not a call to violence directly against a sitting senator, but instead was to show the hypocrisy of the Republican party in terms of how little they truly care about Medicare and Medicaid fraud – because that happens at the point of the provider and not necessarily at the point of the recipients. They want to cut Medicare and Medicaid for the recipients <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/medicaid-cover-congress-proposed-budget-cuts-felt-rcna193897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the tune of $800 billion</a>, and in order to justify that they will do everything in their power to lie and claim that it's actually your grandparents that are stealing from Medicare, and not people like Rick Scott."</p><p>Piker, who back in 2019 found himself in hot water over <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-suspends-popular-leftist-streamer-after-controve-1837518859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a similarly de-contextualized remark</a> that America “deserved 9/11,” resolved to use “more deliberate and more careful language” in the future. Probably a smart move, though as Piker observed in his video, nobody is going to be perfect 100 percent of the time when they’re live day in and day out, going back and forth with a contentious chat. All the while, creators espousing right-wing viewpoints – which often explicitly or implicitly advocate for violence against immigrants and trans people – are <a href="https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held to vastly different standards</a>.</p><p>Also, more importantly, the streamer drama portion of this story barely matters! The problem Piker pointed to during the stream that got him suspended – a former CEO of a healthcare company that copped a record $1.7 billion in fines going on to dodge material consequences, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article288431251.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk away with $10 million in severance and $300 million in stock options</a>, and become a US senator – is an issue of so much more consequence than Piker's word choice that these things are not remotely comparable. It is deranged that millions of people are getting their news from creators who act like a damn Twitch streamer using harsh language to state documented facts is where this story starts and ends, rather than in the halls of actual power.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re all being robbed. It’s as clear as day. There was <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an (alleged) murder about it</a>, and many people <a href="https://aftermath.site/awesome-games-done-quick-speedrun-luigi-skyrim-zelda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sided with the (alleged) murderer</a>. Think about why political pundits and content creators might now be incentivized to muddy the waters, especially where healthcare is concerned. Think about how they might stand to benefit from your distraction, even as normal people’s material circumstances <a href="https://thehill.com/business/5175396-trump-tariffs-economic-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degrade by the day</a>. Think about how platforms make themselves complicit by algorithmically favoring outrage and drama dogpiles over discussion that threatens the status quo. Anybody who frames this conflict in any other way – who suggests different stakes or a different central cast of characters – is either deeply unserious or outright lying to you. Do not listen to them. Odds are, they’re trying to rob you too.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/deliver-at-all-costs-demo"><h3>Deliver At All Costs Is *CRASH* A Great *SMASH* Demo *HOUSE FALLS DOWN*</h3></a><p>Yeah yeah I'll finish the first mission, right after I *DRIVES THROUGH GAS STATION*</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible"><h3>Gundam GQuuuuuuX Is The Sum Of Its Parts In The Best Way Possible</h3></a><p>The new Mobile Suit Gundam is FLCL, Pokémon, and a hint of Evangelion</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Quick, to the training sphere!</h2>
<p>The Big Brother announcement promised the ability to "interact with everything" and "disable and destroy intrusive tele-screens and spy cameras watching the player's every move" across "10 square blocks of Orwell's retro-futuristic world." But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fdgCQOEY4M">footage from the demo</a> falls well short of that promise, instead covering some extremely basic <em>Riven</em>-style puzzle gameplay (flips switches to turn on the power; use a screwdriver to open the grate, etc.) played from a first-person view.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fdgCQOEY4M?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p>
      Sample gameplay from the newly unearthed&nbsp;<em>Big Brother</em> demo.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>It all builds up to a sequence where (according to a walk-through included on the demo disc) you have to put on a "zero-g suit" before planting a bomb inside a "zero gravity training sphere" guarded by robots. Sounds like inhabiting the world of the novel to us!</p>
<p>Aside from the brief mentions of the Thought Police and MiniPac, the short demo does include a few other incidental nods to its licensed source material, including a "WAR IS PEACE" propaganda banner and an animated screen with the titular Big Brother seemingly looking down on you. Still, the entire gameplay scenario is so far removed from anything in the actual <em>1984</em> novel to make you wonder why they bothered with the license in the first place. Of course, MediaX answers that question in the game's announcement, predicting that "while the game stands on its own as an entirely new creation in itself and will attract the typical game audience, the 'Big Brother' game will undoubtedly also attract a large literary audience."</p>
<p>We sadly never got the chance to see how that "large literary audience" would have reacted to a game that seemed poised to pervert both the name and themes of <em>1984</em> so radically. In any case, this demo can now sit alongside the release of 1984's <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Fahrenheit_451_1984"><em>Fahrenheit 451</em></a> and 1992's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gthdLbrJspQ"><em>The Godfather: The Action Game</em></a> on any list of the most questionable game adaptations of respected works of art.</p>

			<p>Acclaim was once an incredibly important company within the games industry, and it soon became legendary after being founded in 1987 for helping to publish titles such as Mortal Kombat, Turok, and NBA Jam. After more than two decades, Acclaim is making a return and has come back with a bold and brave mission in the face of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">tumultuous industry</a>.</p>
<p>The publisher is making a comeback with a focus on supporting indie developers, as well as helping to reignite beloved classic franchises. In this, Acclaim will provide the necessary resources which includes funding, marketing and PR support to independent studios that otherwise wouldn't have been given the opportunity to do so in a highly saturated and chaotic market.</p>
<p>One of the main goals Acclaim will have going forward is to resurrect some classic IP out there that has been enjoyed over the years by a global audience. To be able to make this work, Acclaim has assembled an advisory board with some of the most esteemed industry leaders, such as Russell Binder at Striker Entertainment, Mark Caplan at Ridge Partners, and Jeff Jarrett at Global Force Entertainment.</p>
<p>To ensure the longevity of the company going forward, Acclaim has key partners in Phil Toronto, Partner at VaynerFund, and Eric Vogel, Partner at JET Management, which will help the publishing company foster a healthy investment environment for everyone involved.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," says two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarret. "From my early involvement with the publisher's 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>In addition to these industry legends, Alex Josef is spearheading the relaunch of Acclaim as CEO, an industry veteran who has over two decades of experience in marketing and game publishing across PC, console, and mobile.</p>
<p>"It's an absolute honor and pleasure to be leading the charge in bringing Acclaim back to the forefront of the games industry," said Alex Josef. "We're fortunate that we have an extremely talented team and that we've already signed some incredible indie titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>
<p>The website for Acclaim has its missions at the forefront, as well as a tab for <a href="https://playacclaim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its games</a>, which will be coming soon.</p>
