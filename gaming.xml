            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This weekend, Amazon dropped the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2)</strong> to $429 for early <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> access. Now the retailer has taken things even further by lowering the displayed price to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">plus an additional 10% off at checkout for eligible buyers, bringing the final cost down to potentially $359 (down from $799)</a>. This is an absolute record low price for this power station, and here’s what makes it remarkable: <strong>no competitor offering a 1500W portable power station has ever come close to this pricing</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’re<strong> looking at half off the usual $799 retail price</strong> on a product that solves one of the most frustrating problems for campers, RV owners and anyone preparing for emergencies. Running out of power during outdoor adventures or losing electricity during storms creates genuine hardship, and the Jackery Explorer 1000 provides enough capacity and output to keep essential devices running for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Days of Power, Not Hours</h2>
<p>The 1070 watt-hour capacity provides robust energy storage translating to real-world usage most users are familiar with. You’ll be able to <strong>charge a laptop around 10 times, run a mini-fridge for approximately 15 hours</strong>, support LED lights for a few days or run a CPAP unit for a number of evenings. The LiFePO4 battery chemistry is a step up from lithium-ion batteries employed for lower-end power stations: LiFePO4 batteries last for approximately 4,000 charge cycles until capacity dips at 80%, for reference, standard lithium-ion batteries last for around 500 to 1,000 cycles at the 80% level.</p>
<p>The majority of portable power stations have a peak output of between 300W and 500W which makes for charging small devices like cell phones or a mini portable fan at once. The <strong>1500W of continuous output with a 3000W surge delivers</strong> sufficient power for actual household devices like microwaves, electric kettles, power tools, or a small air conditioner unit. The surge amount addresses the starting burst of power when starting motors which is relevant for devices like refrigerators that consume several multiples of their-rated wattage for a number of seconds at starting time. The unit contains <strong>everyday AC outlets</strong> which accept typical three-prong plugs, and a<strong> 100W USB-C Power Delivery outlet</strong> for quick charging a laptop or tablet without bulky AC adapters.</p>



<p>The fast charging for one hour <strong>allows you to go from zero to full battery in 60 minutes</strong> via a common wall outlet which is extremely fast for a battery of this size. Most rival power stations need 6-8 hours for a full recharge. This quick turnaround is priceless on multi-day camping trips when you may have shore power available for a few hours here or there, or when there are rolling blackouts when you have a quick top-off between outages. The unit also has solar charging capabilities with optional solar panels, allowing you to have power on tap indefinitely off-grid when you harness energy from the sun during the day.</p>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 currently the <strong>highest-rated best-seller on Amazon for generators for outdoors</strong>, with over 4,000 units sold this month alone and a 4.6-star overall rating out of nearly 3,000 reviews. At $359 using the checkout discount on Prime Big Deal Days, you pay less than some 500Wh power centers with half the capacity and a much lower lifespan.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-macbook-air-m4-256gb-16gb-ram-now-costs-half-the-price-of-a-pro-amazon-rushes-to-clear-out-space-2000632140</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Air models dominate Apple’s laptop sales because they handle everyday computing needs for the vast majority of users (without the complexity or cost of Pro models). The catch has always been the price: You need to budget at least $1,000 for the standard configuration and upgrades can quickly push you toward $1,500, the territory where MacBook Pro models begin.</p>
<p>For <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em>, Amazon has essentially eliminated its entire profit margin on the best-selling configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">bringing the 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 chip down to $799 from its usual $999</a>. This represents the lowest price ever for the 2025 model <strong>with 256GB storage and 16GB unified memory</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Designed for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s latest silicon design which is <strong>custom-built for handling Apple Intelligence features</strong> which require intensive processing for on-device AI calculations. That means features like sophisticated editing of photos, real-time translation, voice transcription, and intelligent writing assistant are executed locally on your laptop rather than being sent off to cloud servers.</p>
<p>The performance benefit extends beyond AI features: The M4 handles dozens of web tabs, many productivity applications, video calling and background applications without a hitch or fan functioning. Because it is fanless, the <strong>MacBook Air stays silent for any amount of intensive usage</strong>&nbsp;which is not possible for regular Intel-based laptops which require active heat management when under load.</p>



<p>Apple’s unified memory architecture pools RAM across the CPU, the GPU, and the Neural Engine, so data moves between disparate processing units without the performance penalty that individual pools of memory cause in older computer architectures. The 16GB setup affords sufficient headroom for professional uses like photo editing in Final Cut Pro, video editing or virtual machines. This is important because earlier versions of the MacBook Air had 8GB, which meant that users had to constantly juggle what apps they had open.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display uses IPS LCD tech with a resolution of 2560 pixels by 1664 pixels</strong>. The Liquid Retina display includes the P3 wide color gamut, a brightness of 500 nits and remains legible outdoors under direct sunlight when cheaper laptop screens dim down and become unreadable. True Tone tech automatically changes colour temperature based on ambient illumination for less eye strain when working for long periods at a time.</p>
<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera at last elevates MacBook video call quality. <strong>Center Stage utilizes machine learning when you’re on the go</strong>, automatically framing you by zooming and panning to create the ideal video call composition. This gives you a more professional appearance when participating in online Zoom conferences and eliminates the bothersome need for you to repeatedly shift your position or angle to remain visible on camera.</p>
<p>This laptop sells for $799 on Prime Big Deal Days, which places the 2025 MacBook Air M4 on equal terms truly with mid-range Windows notebooks but with Apple’s superior build quality, battery life, and ecosystem integration.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/megabonk-quick-review.1318063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk is a 3D survivors-like with a very <em>specific </em>sense of humor that has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/why-this-indie-game-is-going-viral">getting a lot of buzz lately</a>. I've played about 15 hours as of writing this, so while this quick look is more meant to share my early impressions across that time rather than being a full, scored review, I’ve already done plenty worth talking about. There is still a fair bit I haven't seen, but I got a little more than half the achievements and unlockables in that time, and I have been enjoying myself a lot. Adding an extra axis of movement does a lot to set it apart, and it's more than competent at all the usual conventions of the genre already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've played these kinds of games before, the basics are pretty much the same. You run around and fight endlessly-spawning waves of enemies that get harder and harder as the time ticks down. It'll start with little goblins, and then you'll get goblins with swords, and eventually build up to some more dangerous stuff like ogres or giant scorpions. Every once in a while a miniboss will pop up and those add some variety and a nice little spike of challenge. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also shrines that let you summon powerful elite packs and even more bosses with the promise of greater rewards, and I always appreciate that kind of thing where I'm not going into a menu and turning the difficulty up, but I can kind of tweak the difficulty as I go based on the decisions I make in the run. I prefer that, honestly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is common for these kinds of games, all of your weapons do their things automatically, whether that's a sword or a rocket launcher. The only controls you're worried about are movement-related. I like the variety and the bombastic attitude of the weapons. There are no two that feel overly similar, and they're all pretty fun to use in different situations. Getting the revolver and the missiles and stacking bonuses to the number of projectiles I can spawn is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course the most obvious and I think the coolest difference here is that Megabonk is built with fully 3D levels and 3D movement. You can jump, and even get power-ups that give you better jumps or double, triple, quadruple jumps which is a ton of fun. There's an item that makes all your weapons do more damage while you're airborne, which can be quite powerful. One of the characters, Monke, can actually climb walls, which gives him some big advantages.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a frantic but tactical loop of going fast while planning out your path carefully.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And this exploration and planning routes across steep cliffs, up and down ramps, is a big part of Megabonk, which makes every run feel interesting and challenging in some ways a lot of survivors-style games aren't. First off, to finish a level, you have to locate the boss gate so you can summon the final boss before the timer runs out and you're eventually overwhelmed by endless waves of ghosts. So there's that added need to get out and comb the map, unless you get lucky and spawn right by the boss gate which sometimes happens, and I like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then the second part is that the map is littered with breakable containers, shrines, and chests, and your power level is going to be directly related to how many of these you can hit within the time limit before you move on to the next level. So there's this frantic but also very tactical loop where you want to go fast while planning out your path carefully to avoid backtracking and tag as many points of interest as possible. Chests also, at least most of them, cost gold to open, and that price goes up every time you open one, so sometimes you have to know when to pass one up because it's not worth waiting around to farm coins when you're not going to be able to afford to open every single chest anyway. The number of considerations I have to weigh in my head to put together a really good run feels satisfying and like I can usually overcome at least a lot of the capricious force of randomness by playing smart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now I do have to talk about the humor, because it's one of the first things I noticed. The entire theme of Megabonk seems to be Millennial and Gen Z internet brain rot. And it's honestly hard to tell if – at the rist of sounding a bit mean or snotty – this supposed to genuinely make me laugh in a surface-level way. Like is this the straightforward sense of humor the developers were aiming for? Or are they doing a Tim and Eric cringe comedy thing, like the <em>real</em> joke is that it's kind of stupid on purpose? How many layers of irony deep are we? In the former case, it doesn't work that well. But if it's the latter, it kind of does.<br>Yeah, in 2025, I'm totally still sending my friends all the latest GigaChads. Remember him? There's an item that spawns "borgars." Dang, did John Hammond show up to pop your champagne after you dug that one up? (The irony is not lost on me that I'm using a reference from a 1993 movie to criticize how old this meme is, but it's a classic, okay?) There's a surprisingly safe for work boss called "Scorpionussy." There's a power-up that "claps cheeks." Practically everything you pick up is some kind of reference to years- or decades-old meme culture. It never got in the way of the gameplay for me, but there were a few times I thought my eyes were going to roll so hard I might sever my optic nerves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk currently only has two levels, a spooky forest and a deadlier desert, at least unless there are some secret ones I'm not aware of. But they do each have three different tiers of increasing difficulty. The first is just a single stage, while each subsequent tier adds one additional stage with a new boss that lets you carry over all your power-ups from the previous one. I do find the lack of changing scenery a bit disappointing. Those two biomes are definitely starting to feel repetitive, and I couldn't find anything like a roadmap that said the devs plan to add more. It's not labeled as Early Access either. But the three tiers definitely provide a good challenge and give me more room to push myself.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Roguelikes and lites</h3><p>Some of my favorite Roguelikes/lites from over the years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meta-progression isn't super deep, but it is meaningful and rewarding. Everything outside of a run costs a separate currency called silver that you can pick up on runs. Getting permission to buy new characters, items, and power-ups requires you to first complete an objective or achievement thematically tied to each one, which is kind of neat. Then you have the more straightforward buffs to level up like getting more rerolls or more weapon slots. I appreciated that you only have to pay for the ability to toggle unlocked items on or off once and then you can use it as much as you want, since I really like to optimize my loot pool going into a run in these types of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are mostly pretty simple in their design but enjoyable to use. I think my favorite is CL4NK who is a robot cowboy gunslinger that starts with the revolver and gets increased critical chance every level. But you've also got a skeleton on a skateboard who does more damage the faster he moves, and the ninja is also a lot of fun because he automatically kills any enemy who misses him with an attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as survivors-likes go, this is a pretty strong one. Especially with the added consideration of the jump button and the whole vertical axis, and the emphasis on route-planning and exploration, I found it had that crucial ability to make me want to start a new run as soon as I finished the last until it was suddenly several hours later. I'm regularly groaning at some of the uninspired image board humor, but I feel like I can sometimes appreciate it in an ironic way, and otherwise just ignore it. I'd say it's worth a look if you have an appetite for another one of these that isn't basically just a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review">Vampire Survivors</a> reskin. I just wish there was a little more level variety.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is quite clearly a Halloween game. The thing about Halloween is that there should always be a little bit silliness amongst the horrific and the scary, and Yacht Club Games' next retro throwback seemed quite well fitted for the season. It was so appropriate that it was even planned to be released on October 31st! All of this to say, yes, Mina the Hollower is delayed, and it doesn't have a new release date either.
</p>
<p>
"The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet," Yacht Club Games explained in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a> announcing the delay. "This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine." They also noted in the post that a new release date isn't being revealed just yet, as they're waiting until the game is submitted to its various platforms.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, it is apparently "so close to being done," and it sounds like it's only smaller things like finalising design, art, and sound, balance tweaks, localisation testing, platform testing, and the act of eating cheese that's holding up the release that was meant to take place this month.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, this is definitely a bit of a shame as I have been hankering for something akin to the GBC Zelda games, and I love a Halloween activity given I am not too far away from my thirties and am very childless so trick or treating is not something I can partake in. On the other hand, as ever there are too many games - both Unbeatable and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> are launching in the first half of November, and boy howdy do I not have the time for either of them.
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed Yatch Club Games find a new release date soon enough! And selfishly, one that's far away from other games I also want to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October was going to be a special month. For the first time since <em>Shovel Knight</em> came out over a decade ago, Yacht Club Games was going to release a new game that had nothing to do with its hit 8-bit platformer. It’s a <em>Link’s Awakening</em>-sized adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/shovel-knight-mina-the-hollower-zelda-castlevania-game-1848463038">called <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>. Unfortunately, it also just got indefinitely delayed.</p> <p>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay <em>Mina the Hollower</em>,” the studio wrote in <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a new blog post on Monday</a>. “The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.”</p>

 <p>Unlike its 2D side-scrolling predecessor,<em> Mina the Hollower</em> is a top-down action game that focuses a bit more on puzzles and combat. Think <em>Castlevania</em> if it fell on the ground with a <em>Zelda</em>-inspired interconnected map. It has all the signs of becoming another clever, charming retro homage if Yacht Club can deliver. Apparently, it still needs more time to cook. There’s no new release date yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily far away from finally coming out.</p>

 <p>“We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line,” Yacht Club wrote today. “The game is&nbsp;<i>so</i> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day.” In the meantime, the developers say they’re working on finalizing design, art, sound, game balance, localization, and QA.</p> <p><em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the third notable game <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">to drop out of the busy October release calendar lineup</a>. Roguelike dungeon game <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>moved to November and <i>Kingmakers </i>is missing its Early Access date this week with no new date announced yet. <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is the one I was looking forward to most, however. I’d love to be spending my end-of-year travel season cozied up to my Switch like it’s 1998 again and the Game Boy Color just came out. We’ll see if it still ends up arriving in time for the holiday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon-2000632012</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-is-going-wild-for-prime-day-the-hero13-black-is-practically-being-given-away-on-amazon.1318015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>GoPro almost never puts its cameras on sale</strong>. Outside of a handful of major shopping events each year, and exclusively through Amazon, you’re paying full price. That’s why <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> and Black Friday are the only real opportunities to snag a deal on their latest gear. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/">the HERO13 Black bundle (including two batteries) is down to $399 from its usual $499, and this is an all-time low for the newest model</a>. If you’ve been waiting to document your ski trips, capture your kids’ soccer games from unique angles, mount a camera on your mountain bike for trail footage or simply record your travels in stunning quality that your phone can’t match, this is your moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4525/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This package comes complete with goodies that truly make a difference: You receive <strong>two Enduro batteries</strong>, which is a big deal because action camera batteries have a short life when you’re recording in chilly weather or capturing high-def video. Enduro batteries are also designed to hold up better when it’s cold outside and have a longer overall life, <strong>giving you up to 2.5 hours of solid 5.3K recording per battery pack</strong>.</p>
<p>Another welcome innovation is t<strong>he waterproof shutter remote</strong> which allows you to initiate recording or stop recording from a distance of up to 196 feet away. This allows you to affix the GoPro HERO 13 Black camera on your helmet, your ride or a tripod and operate it without awkwardly pressing the small buttons on the camera which is extremely handy when your hands are gloved or the camera is mounted somewhere out of easy reach.</p>



<h2>Film-Like Experience That Accommodates Your Trek</h2>
<p>The <strong>HERO13 Black captures at 5.3K resolution</strong> which provides 91% more information than regular 4K and a whopping 665% more resolution than 1080p. That extra resolution provides serious leeway in post-editing. Crop-in on your shots, firm up shaky frames or punch-in on details without sacrificing quality. The GoPro Quik app even allows you to <strong>pull 24.7-megapixel still images straight out of your 5.3K video</strong>&nbsp;so you never have a bad photo because you happened to be recording video rather than pics.</p>
<p>One of the coolest capabilities is <strong>Burst Slo-Mo which takes action at 13 times normal speed</strong>. Just think about being able to capture a skate trick, a breaking wave, or a bike jump with all the little details witnessed in silky smooth slow motion. And you <strong>can capture 4x slow motion at the full 5.3K resolution</strong>&nbsp;which creates extremely detailed slo-mo video that freezes movements and moments your eye might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>The GoPro HERO13 Black includes native support for HB-Series Lenses that are automatically switched when you put them on the camera. The Ultra Wide Lens Mod is perfect for POV shots when you need to see all that’s in front of you, from ski slopes to surf sessions. The Macro Lens Mod places you very close to the subject for close-ups of small objects, details, or animals. Neutral Density filters enable you to naturally blur fast-paced scenes for motion blur and exposure control for sunny scenes, adding a cinematic effect to your clips.</p>
<p>Designed to withstand the toughest environments, the <strong>HERO13 Black is water-resistant up to 33 feet without the need for extra housing</strong>. Water-repellent lens cover minimizes lens flare, giving you clear shots even when wet.</p>
<p>For that price, getting the complete bundle with two batteries is a steal.</p>

                <p>The follow-up to Yacht Club's indie hit Shovel Knight will have to wait a little longer, as the studio has announced that Mina the Hollower will be delayed out of its previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shovel-knight-devs-mina-the-hollower-launches-on-halloween-demo-out-now/1100-6532145/" data-ref-id="1100-6532145">Halloween release date</a>. While Yacht Club said this delay will be a short one, it isn't prepared to nail down an exact date just yet.</p><p>"This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower," the team wrote on its <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>. "The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on October 31, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine."</p><p>Though the delay is short, though, Yacht Club said it doesn't want to announce a new release date until it's submitted to all platforms. In the meantime, it's working on finalizing design, art, and sound, game balancing, localization, and testing. And eating cheese.</p><p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that," the studio said.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is Yacht Club's first original franchise after the breakout success of Shovel Knight in 2014. The studio has been busy in the meantime, though, creating loads of extra DLC campaigns for Shovel Knight, as well as developing and publishing spin-offs like Shovel Knight Showdown and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is inspired by the classic top-down Zelda games, with an art style that pays homage to that color palette as well. It stars a little mouse in a kingdom of animals, and as the name implies, she can burrow underground to solve puzzles and surprise enemies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Shovel Knight Developer Yacht Club Games has delayed its anticipated follow-up, the Zelda-inspired <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/mina-the-hollower-the-next-game-from-the-creators-of-shovel-knight-launches">Mina the Hollower</a>. The upcoming game was scheduled to launch on October 31.</p><p>Initially crowdfunded via Kickstarter, Mina the Hollower centers on the titular mouse, a scientist and explorer who embarks on a mission to rescue a cursed island. The top-down action game sports a retro aesthetic reminiscent of Game Boy Color titles while its combat evokes The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania. As a Hollower, Mina can burrow underground, which plays a substantial role in combat and exploration.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a>, Yacht Club explains that despite working tirelessly to get Mina ready for launch, &nbsp;it says, “we’re just not quite there yet.” The studio then clarifies that the delay won’t be a big one, and the team will spend this time applying additional polish, fine-tuning balancing, finalizing art and sound, and implementing localization.</p><p>“With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!" reads Yacht Club's blog post. Yacht Club did not announce a new launch date for Mina the Hollower, as it wants to wait until the game is submitted to platforms for review.&nbsp;</p><p>Mina the Hollower is currently slated to launch on PC and all major consoles, including a recently announced Switch 2 version.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> lives! Well, of course it does, it would be quite shocking if PlayStation were to cancel it before it even got a chance to become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> 2, but that's neither here nor there. What is here, and soon to be there, is another playtest, of which sign-ups are now available. It is being dubbed a "closed technical test," and plans to run for just a few days, between October 22nd and October 28th, but there are a few differences to be found compared to when we last saw it.
</p>
<p>
For starters, this playtest will take place across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, and it'll be available in both North America and Europe this time. Worth noting is that it is under NDA, so you in particular shouldn't go blabbering about it, let some content creator desperate for views do that instead.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what will be available in the test, there'll be three maps to play through and five runner shells to try out. A big change is that the game will now have proximity chat, and notably, a solo queue - in previous playtests you could only play in teams of three, and even if you could launch into a match solo, you'd be at a real disadvantage. On top of that there's "re-tuned combat pacing… deeper environmental storytelling, and more." 
</p>
<p>
Whether any of that is enough to make it a good game? Hard to say until someone plays it, but even if this is only a brief overview of what's new, it'll need to feel quite radically different to make an impact. I'm not sure if it sounds like it'll manage that just yet.
</p><p>
Heading to the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">blog post</a> about the network test will take you to a form where you can apply to take part in it, which you can do so until October 16th, or from October 13th you'll be able to do so via Steam directly (sign-ups there will run until October 26th).
</p>
<p>
It's interesting that this playtest is under NDA, given how publicly poor the reception was earlier this year. Certainly sounds like Bungie is continuing an attempt at doing some damage control. The last update we had on the game is that it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinitely delayed</a>, which is still the case, obviously not a good sign for the state of the game. Updates in the following months after the test were promised, so we'll have to wait and see where Marathon ends up landing next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a special battle in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactic</em>s</a> that’s been punishing unsuspecting players for generations. Thanks to <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster, fresh recruits can witness the joy and terror of randomly getting jumped by 11 monks in one of the strategy RPG’s lesser-known endgame challenges.</p> <p>Every spot on the map in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> comes with an <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">array of random encounters</a> the game can pull from depending on which side you enter from and how far along you are in the story. Once you hit Chapter 4, the game’s “rare” random encounters become accessible. These special battles are weird, hard, and memorable. None more so than the 11-Monk brawl on Grogh Heights (known in the original PS1 version as Grog Hill). They hit hard and have great range thanks to the Monk’s versatile Martial Arts abilities. God help you if you accidentally drop into the battle while trying to train your squad up on weaker jobs they don’t have many abilities for.</p>

   <p>Fans on the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> subreddit have been posting about these Monks for years. Every so often, someone new to the game takes a photo, uploads it in a thread, and writes something to the effect of “WTF?” Community hero Kronikle has been cataloging every instance and posting each of them under every new thread. This happened <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nyutyr/anyone_seen_a_random_battle_like_this_lol/">again over the weekend</a>.</p>

 <p>“Homie really pulled up with the receipts,” wrote one fan in response. “Dude replies this every time and adds to it. It’s my most favorite thing ever on this subreddit,” wrote another. A third chimed in, “gotta respect the dedication.”</p>

   <p>While the Monks are arguably the game’s most absurd rare battle, there’s close to <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/41329250">a dozen others</a> scattered across the map, each with a chance of occurring when you walk to that specific point from the right direction. A small army of Calculators can spawn at Lenalia Plateau, Yuguo Woods can spawn seven Samurai, and Germinas Peak can spawn a group of Chemists and Orators with powerful guns worth stealing. Certain rare monsters like Tiamats can only spawn in the Bariaus Valley rare battle.</p> <p>Some players seek these fights out in order to farm abilities off the crystals the enemies drop. Others just like the added challenge and variety. Most story battles in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> only draw from a very limited pool of Jobs, making the rare battles extra fun. Fortunately, with the Enhanced mode’s ability to retry and flee battles, you’ll never have to worry about seeing hours of progress get wiped out this way.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-arc-raiders-beta-chat-censor-2000632129</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082"><span>holding an online beta test</span></a><span> until October 8, so fans can play the online modes before the full game launches on November 14. Some players are having matchmaking issues, but I suppose identifying such issues is the whole point of betas, so that’s not too surprising. What is surprising, however, is that players were reporting earlier that </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s in-game text chat was censoring the name of another shooter launching soon. No, it’s not direct competitor </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>. It’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios.</span></p> <p><span>Players were reporting earlier today (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>) that if you sent “Arc Raiders”</span> <span>in the </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> beta’s text chat, the message that would actually pop up would just be a series of asterisks. According to those who tested it, the words “Arc” and “Raiders,” individually, seemed to get through the moderation system just fine. It was only when they were put together in that order that a switch flipped. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>, arguably </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>’s biggest competitor, didn’t seem to be affected, even after taking </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><span>shots at the military shooter in a recent ad</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified that this has since been patched out. I downloaded the beta myself. That was 52GB installed on my scalding hot gamer laptop just to type another game’s name into chat to see what happened.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> isn’t the type of game I would have expected Activision to view as a competitor or threat to </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>. It’s a science fiction extraction shooter in which, sure, you point and shoot at things, so maybe that was enough in someone’s eyes at Activision? I’m now curious what other games could be crossed out in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>’s backend. Embark Studios also made another shooter, </span><i><span>The Finals</span></i><span>, so it’s not like it’s a bright-eyed newcomer to making video games, but it’s still an odd target for Activision to hone in on. They’re not the only ones, as </span><i><span>Battlefield </span></i><span>publisher EA was also </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/"><span>censoring the game’s name in its apps</span></a><span>. What are y’all so scared of? Could it be an error? We’ve reached out to Activision and Embark Studios about the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

The game's multiplayer includes four distinct classes, and it's important to understand the different abilities and gadgets that come paired with each one so you can pick the classes best suited to your playstyle and preferred game modes. In this guide, we break down all the classes in Battlefield 6, including their respective gadgets, signature weapons, traits, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Battlefield_6_class_types">Battlefield 6 class types</a></li><li><a href="#Open_and_closed_weapon_systems">Open and closed weapon systems</a></li><li><a href="#Assault_class">Assault class</a><ul><li><a href="#Assault_gadgets">Assault gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Assault_class">Best weapons for Assault class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Engineer_class">Engineer class</a><ul><li><a href="#Engineer_gadgets">Engineer gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Engineer_class">Best weapons for Engineer class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Support_class">Support class</a><ul><li><a href="#Support_gadgets">Support gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Support_class">Best weapons for Support class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Recon_class">Recon class</a><ul><li><a href="#Recon_gadgets">Recon gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Recon_Class">Best weapons for Recon Class</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Battlefield_6_class_types">Battlefield 6 class types</h2><p dir="ltr">Starting with a simplified breakdown of the classes, they are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Assault:</strong> Frontline attackers who excel in close- to mid-range combat</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Engineer:</strong> Vehicle and destruction experts who can repair friendly vehicles and use a range of explosive equipment</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Support:</strong> A combat medic who assists teammates with healing, ammo resupplies, and quick revives</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recon:</strong> Experts in intelligence, infiltration, and deadly marksmanship</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Each class in Battlefield 6 is paired with a particular squad role. This is supported by a signature gadget, trait, and a skill with a specific weapon type. But don't worry, you <strong>aren't locked into one class type</strong>. You can make custom loadouts for each and swap on the fly mid-match.</p><p dir="ltr">All class types can be impactful on the modes for large maps, but smaller game modes like Squad Deathmatch are infantry only, making classes like the Engineer less useful.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Open_and_closed_weapon_systems">Open and closed weapon systems</h2><p dir="ltr">In the past, Battlefield's four signature roles featured a class-locked weapon system. This meant that Support players were limited to wielding light machine guns, the Recon class had sniper rifles, Engineers had submachine guns, and the Assault players were the only ones who got to use assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">In Battlefield 6, the developer is giving players the option to choose between playlists that feature closed or open weapon systems. The open system means you can pair any weapon class with any role you choose to play. However, there are some slight bonuses you can score for choosing to utilize the game's closed weapon system. Using the signature weapon assigned to a specific class gives you additional perks on the battlefield, such as improved hip-fire control for Engineers who choose a submachine gun. We'll explain these signature weapon benefits for each class below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Assault_class">Assault class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581196" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581196"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Assault class is probably the most straightforward and beginner-friendly role to play. In the Assault role, you're the frontline fighter who is equipped to charge toward objectives or the enemy line. You're armed with a grenade launcher and abilities geared for using breach and clear tactics.</p><p dir="ltr">If you used the Assault class in the beta, you'll find there are a few changes to the role for the launch of Battlefield 6. The signature trait has been adjusted to help speed up capturing objectives, and the Adrenaline Injector no longer provides self-healing abilities.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Assault Rifle. This grants faster transition from sprint to firing and switching to and from assault rifles</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Speeds up capturing objectives for nearby squad members and takes you and your team out of combat status faster</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Adrenaline Injector. This clears and boosts resistance to flash and stun effects, enhances tolerance to explosive and incendiary damage, and improves movement speed</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability: </strong>Nearby enemies that are audible become revealed for the player, with kills prolonging the effect</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Breacher: These units have quicker reloads on grenade launchers, can carry extra grenades, and are more resistant to flash effects.</li><li dir="ltr">Frontliner: These soldiers have improved health regeneration, an additional adrenaline injector charge, and reduced penalty when shooting on the move.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. <strong>Frontliner</strong> is going to be a great pick, especially for beginners, as it helps provide better health regeneration and comes with an additional Adrenaline Injector charge. <strong>Breacher</strong> is the choice if you're more excited about the game's destruction and just wanna blow stuff up.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Assault_gadgets">Assault gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Since the beta, the developer has also added additional gadgets exclusive to the Assault class to make them more helpful with a role focused on teamwork: Assault ladder and Deploy Beacon.</p><p dir="ltr">The ladder lets Assault players create higher vantage points for their team. The Deploy Beacon offers a spawn point, but it has a limited number of uses per squad and will self-destruct if the Assault player spawns back on it. This is designed to be a tactical and limited resource rather than a persistent advantage.</p><p dir="ltr">Other gadget options include: Thermobaric (fire) grenade launcher, high-explosive grenade launcher, and shotgun.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Assault_class">Best weapons for Assault class</h3><p dir="ltr">The <strong>NVO-228E assault rifle</strong> is one of the strongest picks for ARs in Battlefield 6. This assault rifle has a fast fire rate, and the recoil can be easily controlled with some of the gun's best attachments.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not focused on picking the class's signature weapon, the <strong>M4A1 carbine rifle</strong> is another great option for close to mid-range fights.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Engineer_class">Engineer class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581197" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581197"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Engineers play a crucial role in Battlefield 6. They're not only armed with rockets for destruction, but they're also the ones who are equipped with the repair tool capability for repairing their team's vehicles. Tanks are often used for bullying through enemy defenses and holding objectives with firepower, and a good Engineer is often following their friendly tanks, making sure those vehicles stay fit for the fight.</p><p dir="ltr">On the destruction side, Engineers make use of their rockets and explosives for disabling enemy vehicles and tactical destruction. A well-placed rocket or some other explosives can take down structures in a way that helps the team.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Submachine Guns: Improved hip-fire control</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait: </strong>Take reduced damage from explosives</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Repair Tool: Multitool for fixing friendly assets and armor. It can also be used to damage enemy assets</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> Overloads the repair tool to fix vehicles with enhanced efficiency</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training Paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Anti-Armor: A master of wreaking havoc on enemy vehicles with rockets that reduce repair effectiveness, as well as extra ammunition and faster reloads for launchers</li><li dir="ltr">Combat Engineer: An expert dedicated to keeping everything in pristine shape. This soldier auto-generates health of vehicles they're occupying, is able to use their repair tool longer before overheating, and can automatically spot nearby mines</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. One is geared towards taking out enemy tanks and other vehicles, while the other path is designed to help you repair your friendly vehicles. <strong>Combat Engineer</strong> can be a great pick if you're the one who likes to ride around tanks, as the ability allows vehicles to auto-generate health while you're inside.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Engineer_gadgets">Engineer gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Engineers can choose from a selection of launchers, a supply crate, and a variety of different mines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Engineer_class">Best weapons for Engineer class</h3><p dir="ltr">If you're sticking with the closed-weapons playlist, you'll want to consider the <strong>SGX submachine gun</strong>. The SGX was a standout during the beta, offering a fast rate of fire, high damage, and virtually no recoil with the right attachments.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're playing in the open-weapons playlist, you might want something with better range than a submachine gun can offer. The <strong>NVO-228E assault rifle</strong> is one of the strongest picks for mid-range combat.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Support_class">Support class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581198" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581198"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Support class essentially plays the hero role in Battlefield 6. Support players are the medics, who run into the fight to revive downed teammates and protect their numbers on the map. They also provide their team with supply bags that offer health and ammo. Some game modes are geared toward team life counts, so having good medics on your team can be crucial for the win.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that anyone can revive downed players in Battlefield 6, but no one does it faster and more efficiently than a medic.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Light Machine Guns. Player does not suffer a sprint speed penalty with this weapon type</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Can drag and revive teammates faster</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Supply Bag. Heals allies and resupplies weapon and gadget ammo</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> The supply area of effect around Support player is temporarily increased, as well as the speed at which they revive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Combat Medic: These units are able to function as a health dispensary for allies and also regenerate health when they're reviving teammates</li><li dir="ltr">Fire Support: These combat experts have improved weapon control from mounted positions and can provide ammo to teammates</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. <strong>Fire Support</strong> might be a decent option for you if you're planning on using LMGs for the closed-weapon system, but in most cases the <strong>Combat Medic</strong> is going to be the most powerful choice for really leaning into the role of a medic. Being able to regenerate your health while reviving allies is a nice bonus.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Support_gadgets">Support gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Support players can choose from the Defibrillator paddles for faster revives or deployable cover for helping provide protection to teammates.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Support_class">Best weapons for Support class</h3><p dir="ltr">Let's be honest, the LMGs don't always feel great to use. However, the <strong>L110 light machine gun</strong> can be equipped with some decent attachments to help manage the recoil and increase the damage range.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the signature LMG weapon class, a submachine gun or assault rifle can be a good choice when you're trying to take out enemies to perform a heroic revive. The <strong>SGX submachine gun</strong> or the<strong> M4A1 carbine rifle</strong> could be a good pick.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Recon_class">Recon class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581199" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581199"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Recon class is geared toward stealth, sniping, and gathering helpful intel. Recon players can spot enemies for their teammates and also earn a UAV. Playstyles can vary between posting up on a hillside and sniping away at enemy forces or using stealth to flank and get behind enemy lines. So, you can pick what style caters best to you.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Sniper Rifles. Offers faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope sway, and improved breath control to help stabilize aim for longer</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Automatically spot enemies while aiming through an optic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Motion Sensor. This gadget tracks enemy movement in its range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> Call in a UAV to a marked position for passive spotting of enemies</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Sniper: These long-distance engagement experts have improved auto-spot speed, range, and duration. Sniper shots will highlight enemies and temporarily prevent healing, while headshots will render the struck enemy unable to be revived at all</li><li dir="ltr">Spec Ops: Allows quieter takedowns, crouch, and prone movement. It also allows the player to spot nearby enemy gadgets. Going prone takes the player out of combat much faster and removes the spot on self</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. Which path you choose greatly depends on how you want to play the Recon role. If you want to post up and snipe, then you'll want to choose the <strong>Sniper</strong> training path, while <strong>Spec Ops</strong> is the choice for getting mobile and infiltrating enemy locations with stealth play.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Recon_gadgets">Recon gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Recon players will have access to a recon drone, C-4 explosives, and gadgets geared toward getting intel for their team.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, the Recon class had the Spawn Beacon to provide a dedicated respawn point, but this device was relocated to the Assault class after the beta.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Recon_Class">Best weapons for Recon Class</h3><p dir="ltr">The <strong>M2010 ESR sniper rifle</strong> is the best choice for sniping in the Recon class. You'll need to add some attachments to help boost the gun's damage range and performance, but this is a solid pick for sticking with the signature weapon of the Recon class.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not the most skilled sniper, but you still want something for long-range fights, you can ditch the sniper class for a DMR rifle. The <strong>M39 EMR</strong> and the <strong>SVK-8.6</strong> can both be solid picks for DMR rifles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following a whiplash-inducing 50-percent price hike for Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">the Xbox brand overall are in a funky place</a>. That nauseating price increase is likely the loudest adjustment being made to the once-decent Game Pass subscription service, but it’s far from the only one. Old tiers have been overhauled and renamed, with tighter restrictions on when you can access certain games and how many of them you’ll have access to, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">discounts and deals subscribers once enjoyed</a> are but ash scattered to the wind.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">The Enshittification Of Game Pass Is Here</a></p> <p>While the Ultimate plan now has a few more features than it once did, the sting of paying 50 percent extra has caused serious damage to the Xbox brand, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision-merger-2000631611">progressive lawmakers saying “told ya so</a>” after Microsoft gobbled up a bunch of studios and publishers. This is all going down while <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">rumors of an ad-supported version of Xbox Game Streaming</a> are swimming around. That last point shouldn’t be surprising as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-1850987502">Xbox consoles have routinely been home to various ads</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/4i1LCVSdD7k?t=277">taking up your full screen</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consoles/comments/1nw5so9/xbox_consoles_are_now_getting_a_fullscreen_xbox/">on boot</a>.</p>

 <p>As is customary for the first quarter of the 21st century, <a href="https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/">we’re all quoting comrade Doctorow</a> in response to these wild changes. But in case you’re looking to shrug off that late-stage-capitalism ennui with some gaming on Xbox, let’s break down what Game Pass now costs, and how you can still get it for pre-hike prices, for now.</p>

 <h2>How much does Game Pass cost now?</h2> <p>Following last week’s changes, Xbox Game Pass presently offers three tiers:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Essential ($10/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Premium ($15/month)</li> <li aria-level="1">Ultimate ($30/month)</li> </ul> <p>All of these tiers let you play online multiplayer on Xbox, though <b>the number of games available and when you get access to them varies</b>. Essential and Premium don’t offer day-one access for new Xbox games. Premium, however, lets you play recently released Xbox titles “within 12 months of launch.” Ultimate (which will run you a ridiculous $360/year if you hang on to your sub all year) grants you the most games with the fastest access: Day-one availability on first- and third-party games, plus all the games in EA Play and Ubisoft+ Classics.</p>

 <p>You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass#join">check out the full details on Xbox’s site</a>, but it’s clear that Game Pass isn’t only more expensive than it once was, it’s also become far more complicated than just throwing a modest sum of money at Microsoft per month to be sure you can play the new <i>Gears</i> or <i>COD</i> at launch.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-game-pass-price-xbox-ally-leak-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-2000631038">GameStop Hits Back At Massive Xbox Game Pass Price Hike</a></p> <p><b>There’s also a PC-only plan for $16.49/month</b> which promises day-one availability of Xbox-published games, as well as some third-party ones. It also includes EA Play.</p>

 <h2>Hang on to Game Pass for Console if ya got it</h2> <p>There’s a select group of Game Pass subscribers who will be happy to know they just dodged a bullet (for now, anyway). As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-console-grandfather-accounts/">confirmed by our comrades over at <i>Polygon</i></a>, if you are presently subscribed to the now-phased-out Game Pass for Console and automatic payment is still set up and functioning, you will be grandfathered in with all of the benefits of the old subscription.</p>

 <p>Should you cancel payments, however, you’ll lose access to that retired plan and will need to choose among the three poison pills of a service Microsoft is selling you. Checking which plan you have is as simple as logging in to Game Pass’ website, clicking on “My Microsoft Account” and checking what active subscriptions you currently have.</p> <h2>GameStop is still selling subs at the older prices (for now)</h2> <p>In an unlikely turn of events, GameStop of all companies has lol’d at Xbox by continuing to sell Ultimate subscriptions for just $20/month. It may be worth checking out other retailers, probably in brick and mortar stores, to see if you can snag a subscription card for a cheaper price as well.</p> <h2>Discounts got the ax. Now it’s all about “Rewards”</h2> <p>One of the cooler things about the Game Pass of Old™ was that you’d regularly get access to exclusive discounts on games and DLC. That’s obviously no longer in Microsoft’s interests to offer you as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead">Microsoft has confirmed to <i>IGN</i></a> that instead of getting a 10-percent discount on DLC, you’ll now just earn more Rewards.</p>

 <p>“Rewards” are a non-Xbox-exclusive program that basically lets you earn money to spend on various Microsoft products. You can earn points otherwise by browsing the web with Bing while using Microsoft Edge (lol what are we doing here, ya’ll?), and now by playing games with an active Game Pass subscription.</p> <p>If that sounds confusing, I regret to inform you that it’s probably that way by design. Essential will net you up to $25 in rewards per year, Premium allows for up to $50, and Ultimate will let you earn up to $100. You can read all of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards/about">nitty gritty details about the Microsoft Rewards program here</a>.</p>

 <h2>What are other gaming subscription services charging?</h2> <p>Pricier subs, the death of discounts, it all sounds painful and it is! That might have you wondering what’s going on with other subscription services, especially if you value an ongoing service over just straight-up purchasing and owning your games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions">PlayStation has a similar three-tier structure</a> (no options for PC gamers though). The most costly version of these will only cost you $160 for the full year, which is a full $200 less than what Xbox is charging for Ultimate. The most basic version of its subscription service will only cost you $80/year, but it doesn’t come with a game catalog. You’ll need to buy the middle-tier option at a minimum for that, which will run you $15/month or $135/year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/">Nintendo has two subscription services</a> but doesn’t offer any Switch games via a Netflix-style, download-on-demand service. Its most basic service costs $20/year, lets you play online among other benefits, and lets you play from a library of NES, SNES, and Game Boy games whenever you want. At $50/year, a pricier tier expands that retro library to include select GameCube, GBA, N64, and Sega Genesis games (yes, really!).</p>

 <h2>A reminder: No company can increase the cost of games you fully ‘own’</h2> <p>I put ‘own’ in quotes there because, especially on PC, there’s debate as to whether or not our Steam libraries (or any digital library) is made up of the games themselves, or is just a collection of licenses granting us access to the games. (There’s always GOG if you want to be sure you’ll just get straight up .exe files of your games, though it is a more limited collection.) But that argument aside, if you plunk down $60-70 bucks to snag a new game that doesn’t have a perpetual monetization scheme baked into it, you will continue to have access to that game without needing a corporation to charge you every month.</p> <p>Maybe you’ll have a smaller library of games available to you at any given moment, but at least they’ll be yours. Period. Consider it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">Xbox Still Swears It’s Not Giving Up On Console As Fan Morale Craters</a></p> <p>Subscriptions make sense for many folks, no doubt. But having direct access to your games keeps you away from these kinds of shenanigans, and I shudder to think there’s a generation of gamers growing up right now that think more about getting an Ultimate Game Pass card for their birthdays or holidays than an actual copy, digital or physical, of a game that they’ll own for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Coming 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Revolution Software has unveiled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_the_smoking_mirror_reforged">Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</a>, an enhanced rerelease of the second game in the Broken Sword series. And it's coming to Switch, alongside other platforms, in early 2026.</p>
<p>Originally teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/broken-sword-reforged-team-teases-another-remaster-might-be-on-the-cards">much earlier this year</a>, The Smoking Mirror appropriately follows on from the excellent 2024 enhanced release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a> and brings with it the same bells and whistles. Though it <em>is</em> getting a 4K release this time — perhaps a free patch for Switch 2 owners, then? We hope so...</p>
<p>The Smoking Mirror is perhaps equally as beloved as the first game, so we're sure fans are extremely excited to dive into this rerelease. Plus, for those who want an extra dose of nostalgia, you can swap between the 1997 visuals and the new 'reforged' ones here, too.</p>
<p>Taking place six months after Shadow of the Templars, George Stobbart reunites with his friend Nico Collard in Paris; she's been researching Mayan history after receiving a Mayan stone tablet. But this path takes the pair on the road to unravelling a deadly conspiracy, all across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America.</p>


<p>Not only will you be able to swap between the old and new visuals, but you'll once again have the chance to play 'traditional mode', where puzzles are harder, or a 'story mode' if you need a few hints along the way.</p>
<p>Right now, we've got to wait until next year to get our hands on The Smoking Mirror, but if you haven't checked out Shadow of the Templars, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">we highly recommend it</a>.</p>

<p>Have you played The Smoking Mirror before? Will you be getting this on Switch in 2026? Let us know in the comments<em>.</em></p>

Better yet, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6D8BR?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>a bundle of all four is discounted at Amazon right now</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fallout Commander Decks: Under $40 Each With This Bundle Deal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has all four decks for $144.99, a reduction of 11% on the $162.99 list price. That might not sound like a huge amount, but consider what that value represents when the Mutant Menace deck is selling for $70 and upwards on its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the decks, the good news is that they’re all pretty great. Mutant Menace is one of the best, powering up its spooky Mothman Commander with counters as you deal radiation to everyone else at the table, while Hail Caesar is all about being aggressive and sacrificing cards to power up Caesar himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Science! offers something a little different since it leans into energy counters and powering up the board with artifacts, while Scrappy Survivors is definitely popular since it’s helmed by the adorable Dogmeat and has the series’ four-legged star rummaging through your graveyard for equipment and tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a reminder, each of these decks comes with a Collector Booster Sample Pack, too. They contain two cards each, but it’s better than getting irradiated, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you already have any of these, Amazon has discounts on a couple of them, too. At the time of writing, you can pick up <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6D8Bk?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Scrappy Survivors for $44.99</u></a>, a discount of 25%, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxRpb?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Hail Caesar undercuts it by literal cents</u></a>: It’s $44.95. Finally, Amazon isn’t showing it as discounted, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgy2B?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>$40 is a decent price for Science</u></a>!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside these Fallout discounts, Amazon also has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-tv-show-4k-deal-amazon-buy-2-get-1-free-october-prime-day-2025">deal on the Fallout TV Series in 4K</a> as part of its popular "3 for 2" promotion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have previewed some of the gameplay tweaks and balance changes coming with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> day one patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information about the first patch for this week’s long-awaited back-to-basics Battlefield game was outlined in a post on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its official website</u></a> today. It comes with a breakdown from the team explaining how their pre-release Battlefield Labs and beta tests helped them prepare for launch, with the first Battlefield 6 patch set to provide an even more stable foundation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who played the Battlefield 6 open beta in August will notice several fundamental changes to how the DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive-developed game feels after its day one patch is downloaded. Today’s first look at the Battlefield 6 launch update is only a taste of what's to come, with full patch notes for the more than 200 changes set to arrive later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list are tweaks the BF Studios team says will make movement feel more responsive, including fixes for “several movement issues” and changes to pacing. Weapon attachments should also display correctly across the Battlefield 6 experience, with the day one patch also promising rebalanced automatic weapons that make long-range gunplay more rewarding for tap firing and burst control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beta players will also be happy to hear Rush and Breakthrough have been reworked to improve balance between both the attacking and defending teams. Gadgets in Battlefield 6 will also be changed for the day one patch. The MBT-LAW, for example, is now set as the default Engineer launcher, while the MAS 148 now behaves more realistically, and Deploy Beacons have been updated to limit one spawn per player.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Battlefield 6 day one patch also promises updated UI and HUD elements, cleaner audio, improved network stability, and more, today’s post also comes with an update on one of the most hotly contested topics in the community: Open vs. Closed Weapons. Closed locks guns to specific classes, while Open allows each class to utilize a variety of different weapon types. Despite waves of fans hoping to see the BF Studios team lean on Closed classes for Battlefield 6, the team insisted in today’s post that Open classes were preferred by “the vast majority of players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lastly, another key insight from the Open Beta was that the vast majority of players, after trying both playlist types, chose to stick with Open Weapons,” BF Studios says. “This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6. At the same time, we recognize that some players prefer the Closed Weapons experience. To support them, official Closed Weapons playlists will be available at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Additionally, Closed Weapons mutators will remain part of the Portal toolset, so players can create and share their own custom experiences.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 has a release date of October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

As previously disclosed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-helped-playstation/1100-6527989/" data-ref-id="1100-6527989">82% of all Black Ops 6 sales</a> came from PlayStation consoles.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the primary reasons Microsoft purchased COD publisher Activision Blizzard was to get new exclusive titles for Game Pass and drive the growth of that subscription service. However, Bloomberg's report notes that Game Pass' subscriber growth has slowed significantly since 2020, and Microsoft hasn't shared its subscriber numbers since it hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-is-not-coming-to-ps5-or-switch-memberships-rise-to-34-million/1100-6521132/" data-ref-id="1100-6521132">34 million in February 2024</a>.</p><p>Microsoft recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">price hikes for Game Pass</a>, including a $30 monthly fee for Game Pass Ultimate to get titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> on day one. Lina Kahn--the ex-commission chair of the Federal Trade Commission who opposed Microsoft's Activision buyout--<a href="https://x.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently wrote</a> that "Microsoft's acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers."</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be on Game Pass Ultimate when it launches on November 14 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-adds-non-sbmm-playlist-opens-for-everyone/1100-6535236/" data-ref-id="1100-6535236">Black Ops 7's public beta</a> will run through October 8.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a pretty abysmal live stream where Bungie defeatedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">confirmed that one of its developers had lifted the work of another artist and put it in its new shooter</a>, Marathon, without permission, attribution, or compensation, you could practically taste the delay announcement incoming. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-rumor-of-no-marketing-plans-suggests-potential-delay/">A sudden lack of any marketing</a> for Marathon further pushed the rumour of a delay, and a month later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">by June 2025, it was official</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen hide nor hair of Marathon (though Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">has been active with new Destiny 2 content</a>), and you would absolutely not be the first to have speculated that the game was never going to come back. Not so, it would seem. Bungie proved, at least to some degree, that Marathon is not dead, and has opened a new round of sign-ups for a Closed Technical Test taking place later this month.</p>



<p>The test is invite-only, and players wishing to participate will have to sign an NDA in order to do so. The test will run later this month, from October 22-27, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">blog post on Bungie's website,</a> the studio adds that it has been running closed tests since June, and this is the first one it is looking to open up to more players. The test will include three maps, proximity chat, a solo queue, and "<em>re-tuned</em>" combat.</p>



<p>Bungie claims it'll talk more about what's next for Marathon at some point after the conclusion of the test. The last we heard about Marathon's release window is that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">currently set for sometime in March 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>
In the late '90s, early 2000s, there were two distinct flavours of aesthetics: boomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, and Y2K girlypop vibes (for the sake of this argument we will ignore every other aesthetic that existed at the time). Boomer shooters like Doom and Wolfenstein were bloody, gory, and had a real "video games are gritty and cool now kind of vibe." Conversely, products aimed at young girls were often glittery, pink, featured leopard print, and were often about love and harmony. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/incolatus-dont-stop-girlypop">Don't Stop, Girlypop!</a> is a game that combines these two vibes, and it is very good (and stressful).
</p>
<p>
Quite specifically, Don't Stop, Girlypop is a self-described "Y2K arena movement shooter where standing still is not an option." You really do have to be constantly on the move, there's even a combo meter that raises higher and higher letting you go faster and subsequently damage more. I had a go at its new demo that just came out today, and let me tell you, I felt like I was having a heart attack, in as positive a way as I can put that.
</p>
<p>
This is a game where calling it maximalist would be an understatement. There's flip phones, you can customise your arms to have funky patterns, you can put little bows on your guns, enemies are constantly coming at you from all angles, and you need to be ready to take them down quickly, because everything moves fast in this world. The thing is, I'm not very good at shooters, so in my experience of its demo, I quickly got overwhelmed. Even still I could find myself learning the ropes as I went along, and I'm sure more experienced shooter aficionados could get to grips with it pretty quickly.
</p>
<p>
Outside of loving its vibe, I'm into the equally over the top story - "Mining corp Tigris Nix wants to drain your world of The Love, a natural force keeping your planet alive. Lay waste to its robot drones to heal the Oasis!" That's all ridiculous! Yet it matches the tone of its look, and has a healthy amount of corporation frustration, always an added bonus in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
Don't Stop, Girlypop! doesn't have a release date just yet, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">but you can wishlist it and try out its demo on Steam now</a>.
