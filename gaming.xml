<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a> has received multiple updates since it launched earlier this year and alongside Update 1.3.0, Firaxis Games has now released the <strong>Tides of Power Collection</strong>.</p>
<p>This is "free to claim" on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop until <strong>5th January 2026</strong> and is "yours to keep permanently at no cost". After this date, you'll be required to purchase it.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown about what you can expect, along with an official graphic, and below this are the full details about the DLC (via the game's website patch notes):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Tides of Power Update:</strong> This is now fully claimable on Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch...Starting today, add Edward Teach, Republic of Pirates, and Tonga content packs to your game, and then receive the Sayyida al Hurra, Ottomans, and Iceland content packs in-game when they're released in December 2025. If you successfully claim this content by January 5, 2026 at 6:59AM PT, it's yours to keep; otherwise it will be available for individual purchase starting January 5, 2026."</p>

<h2 id="tides-of-power-part-1-4th-november-2025">Tides of Power - Part 1 (4th November 2025)</h2>
<h2 id="leaders">Leaders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added new leader Edward Teach.</strong></p>
<p>Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate whose name sparked dread in the captains of the Caribbean. In 1716, he joined the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, a leader of the Flying Gang, and quickly gained his own ships. With his impressive height, his long beard (decorated with, at times, lit fuses), and reputation for violence, he stalked the sea-lanes of the Caribbean and the nightmares of sailors. He outlived the Flying Gang and moved his operation to the Outer Banks of present-day North Carolina, where a pirate hunter, Robert Maynard, finally caught up with him.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Militaristic, Economic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Blackbeard</strong>: All Naval Units gain the Pirate Ability, allowing them to cross borders of other civilizations, Plunder Trade Routes from non-Allied civilizations, and attack Naval Units of non-Allied civilizations without declaring war. Defeating any Naval Units with your own Naval Units provides Gold equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength and captures that Unit. Increased Gold maintenance costs for all Naval Units.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda – Queen Anne’s Revenge</strong>: Increase Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that build Naval Units. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that neglect to build Naval Units.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="civilizations">Civilizations</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Exploration Age civilization Republic of Pirates.</strong></p>
<p>Where there is wealth, there is greed. The scramble for new world riches in the early 18th century brought English, Spanish, French, and Dutch fleets – but the prospect of quick riches also brought pirates. These were rarely organized, but in 1706, one band, the Flying Gang, took over the island of New Providence in the Bahamas and set up a short-lived republic for all who sought fortune... and came with few scruples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Economic, Militaristic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Flying Gang</strong>: Increased Yields from Pillaging and Coastal Raiding with Naval Units. Settler Units cannot be trained or purchased, but you can capture other civilizations' Settlers. Naval Units, Treasure Convoys, and Buccaneer Units can move into other civilizations' borders without being at war or having Open Borders.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Buccaneer</strong>: Unique Commander Unit. Gains a set number of charges to use the 'Raiding Party' Action every set number of Promotions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Action - Raiding Party</strong>: Targets an adjacent Treasure Resource. This Settlement instantly spawns a Treasure Convoy under your control equal to the number of Treasure Resources; this does not reset until another Treasure Convoy is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Sloop</strong>: Unique Naval Unit (replaces Privateer). Can cross other civilizations' borders, Pillage Trade Routes between non-Allied civilizations, and attack Units of non-Allied civilizations without going to war. Can move after attacking and has a set amount of Movement.</li>
<li><strong>Associated Wonder – Havana Harbor</strong>: Gold Base. This Settlement generates Treasure Convoys worth a set amount of Treasure Fleet points in the Exploration Age (effect scales based on game speed). Increased Economic Attribute. Must be built in Distant Lands on Coastal Tiles adjacent to non-Lake tiles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Antiquity Age civilization Tonga.</strong></p>
<p>Into the endless blue, in search of new lands on scattered islands, the Polynesians sailed, settling the island of Tonga nearly three thousand years ago. Around 1000 CE, though, came another expansion, the Tu’i Tonga Empire – a struggle for dominance, tribute, and fealty over the Pacific. The Tongan kings maintained this system of hierarchical lordship over the islands until it, too, splintered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Expansionist, Diplomatic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Lords of the South</strong>: Increased Influence on City Halls and the Palace if adjacent to Coast tiles. Cannot incorporate City-States.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Tehina</strong>: Unique Scout Unit. Can enter Ocean tiles (without taking damage) and embark at the start of the Age. Cannot disembark in Distant Lands, but can use Coastal Raid on adjacent Discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Kalia</strong>: Increased Combat Strength against Districts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wonders">Wonders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added four new Wonders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great Lighthouse – Antiquity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold Base. Grants a free Merchant when built. +15 Water Trade Route Range in all Settlements. +1 Sight to all Naval Units. Must be built on a Coast tile adjacent to Land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nan Madol – Exploration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provides +3 Culture, +3 Production, and +3 Happiness on the Palace and City Hall on Islands (a landmass with a maximum of 15 tiles). Must be built in an Island City on Coast adjacent to Land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Great Blue Hole – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Science and +4 Happiness. Adjacent sea rural tiles receive +2 Culture. Placed on the Coast adjacent to 6 coast tiles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mapu'a Vaea Blowholes – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Production and +4 Happiness. +2 Culture to all Coastal land tiles in this Settlement. Impassable.</li>
<li>Placed on the Coast adjacent to Cliffs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<p>Firaxis has also included some platform-specific updates tied to the Switch and Switch 2 in Update 1.3.0. This includes the following:</p>
<p><strong>Switch / Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR options now appear when undocking Switch.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where the last character entered with the virtual keyboard would appear incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>You can find out more about Update 1.3.0 and what else it includes in the official update notes on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">official Civilization website</a>.</p>

                <p>The time of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo: Infinite</a> is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.</p><p data-embed-type="html"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yT_lkR3V4-0?si=8JYCsywDbhhGSiTp" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p>In a message posted to <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Halo site</a>, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on "multiple Halo titles in development." This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">saying for over a year now</a> that there are multiple new Halo games in development.</p><p>"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us," reads the statement. "While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned."</p><p>The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the original Halo that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">bring the franchise to PlayStation 5</a> for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">a live-service Halo game</a>, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmo-was-killed-to-protect-execs-stock-bonus-developer-claims/1100-6535871/" data-ref-id="1100-6535871">some light on the Halo MMO</a> from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.</p><p>Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">Halo remake "warms my heart,"</a> while another former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes</a>.</p>

		<p>The travails of Grand Theft Auto 6 really are a sign of just how much game development has changed over the decades. There were three GTAs on PS2, there were two on PS3, and now we’re lucky to see one big game a generation from Rockstar – I think we ought to really count Red Dead Redemption 2 in this. It’s something that’s echoed by the likes of Naughty Dog, where the most prestigious studios now take what feels like forever to produce their games.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m talking about that because GTA 6 got delayed by another six months.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>So, that’s obviously the biggest headline of the week, closely followed by the back and forth over work unionisation at Rockstar. Let’s get to those and all the other biggest stories we’ve caught.</p>

<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>

</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up. Enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>

            <p>Active development on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> will end on the same day that Operation: Infinite kicks into gear: 18th November.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, Halo Infinite was announced amid a 10-year plan to "continu[e] Master Chief's saga for years to come".</p><p> Now, however, with less than half of those ten years on the clock, Halo Studios - formerly known as 343 Industries - has confirmed Operation Infinite is, ironically enough, not infinite at all, but will "be the last major update currently planned for Halo Infinite".</p>

<p>"Operation: Infinite may be the last major update currently planned for Halo Infinite, but we're fully committed to supporting players with exciting challenges, ranked rewards, and community events throughout next year and beyond," the team <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview">said</a>.</p>
<p>"As the Halo Studios team shifts focus to in-development projects such as Halo: Campaign Evolved, we'd like to thank our Halo Infinite players for years of steadfast support."</p>
<p>The team said it's been a "legendary run of Seasons, Events, Fractures, and Operations, with plenty of maps, modes, sandbox additions, Forge tool upgrades, and incredible memories along the way", and thanked Halo's community for its support and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Your excitement is the lodestar for our every effort. Whether you're a long-time player, a recently returned Spartan, or a brand-new ally, we’re grateful to have you on our Fireteam.</p>
<p>"As we look ahead, your feedback will continue to help us refine our goals, in hopes of exceeding expectations and delivering the best Halo experiences possible. Throughout our day, we look to your suggestions, your art, and even your memes as constant reminders of our dual commitment to faithfully stewarding Halo's legacy and forging its future."</p>
<p>Starting 18th November, Operation: Infinite will introduce a 2X boosts on Career Rank and SP, 100-tier Operation Pass, eight earnable armour sets, new Ranked Seasons, and "200 never-before-released customisations" arriving in The Exchange.</p>
<p>The news comes after Halo art director Glenn Israel left Halo Studios last month after 17 years working on the franchise.</p>
<p>Israel worked on titles such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-3-odst">Halo 3: ODST</a> and the most recent Halo Infinite, across both Bungie and 343 Industries (now known as Halo Studios). As he left, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-art-director-leaves-studio-after-17-years-with-ominous-message-alluding-to-discontent">dropped an ominous message that appears to allude to discontent within the studio</a>. It follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs at Microsoft</a> this year.</p>

		<p>Halo Studios has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> has reached the end of the road as a live service, with Operation: Infinite set to be the last major content update when it arrives on 18th November.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview#thankyou">team writes</a>, “As we look back on four years of evolution and updates in Halo Infinite, we’d like to thank our community for your steadfast support. Without your feedback and enthusiasm, Halo Infinite multiplayer would not be the special place it is today: a robust arena for slaying and playing, with something for every Spartan.</p>


<p>“With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us. While we remain committed to supporting <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.”</p>
<p>This final content update will bring a&nbsp;2X boosts to Career Rank and SP, a 100-tier Operation Pass, eight armour sets to earn, new Ranked Seasons, and 200 new customisations in The Exchange.</p>
<p>Following this, the game will still be receiving stability updates, and Halo Studios will continue to support it with rotating in-game challenges to let you progress through the Operation Passes that will remain available, and there will be new ranked rewards, ranked seasons and community events. There just won’t be any more big content drops and battle passes.</p>

<p>This is in large part down to Halo Studios needing to put more resources toward their upcoming projects. A lot is being made of the studio’s old plan for Halo Infinite to be a 10-year game, but that plan was made at a very different time with different studio leadership, and grand aspirations for the Xbox Series X|S generation. But Halo Infinite then suffered a difficult launch, the Xbox Series has struggled, and Microsoft has dramatically changed its plans. For Halo, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/343-industries-is-now-halo-studios-announces-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/">studio has jumped across to developing in Unreal Engine 5</a>, it’s rebranded from 343 Industries to Halo Studios, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo: Campaign Evolved has been announced</a> – a remake of the first game in UE5 that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series and PC. There’s also another mooted live service game rumoured to be in the works.</p>
<p>I enjoyed Halo Infinite through its first year or so, but it’s actually a little bit surprising that the studio stuck it out this long.</p>

		<p>Escape From Duckov has hit 3 million sales since it launched on October 16th, Team Soda has announced. It is one of the big indie success stories of the year, with players taking to the slightly bizarre premise of the game. In Escape From Duckov, players play as an armed duck in a survival RPG where the goal is to gather resources, build a base, and survive the more hostile ducks that live in the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="We're Ducks.

<p>In a message celebrating 3 million sales, Team Soda said, <em>“Three million Ducklings have gathered! Whether you’re a newcomer just joining Duckov, a seasoned duck with a warehouse full of treasures, a creative duck who loves to share Duckov with others, or a MOD duck making Duckov shine with your imagination and codes. Thank you to every Duckling!&nbsp;Because of you, Duckov stays full of life! The journey of Duckov is far from over. We’ll keep bringing you new content and an even better experience. Quack quack!”</em></p>

Considering the appearance of Alyssa Ashcroft in the upcoming title, I’d love for Capcom to provide a legitimate way to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a> on modern consoles, but alas, I don’t think it’s happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>We’ve also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami 2</a> on the horizon, so I’ve gone back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> for a little bit. Truth be told, alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, this might actually be my favourite launch game for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>

<p>I'm in the fun little position of being <em>between games</em> after wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> earlier this week, and not wanting to splash out on anything else 'AAA' until Metroid comes a-calling. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> is still eating up my every free moment (obviously), but maybe now it my chance to sneak in something smaller before the year's up. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> has been looking at me from my wishlist for a while now, so perhaps it's finally time to dive in.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I just remembered that I've had <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> on pause while I put Pokémon in the rear-view mirror. <em>That's</em> the weekend's plan sorted, then.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm hoping to polish off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> this weekend. I've found myself playing/watching a little bit every morning over breakfast, as if I were channel-hopping before school as a kid. It's a cracking little piece of software - look out for a review sometime soon-ish.</p>
<p>Beyond that (and keeping with the early '90s theme), I found myself redownloading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> just to get a look at the Simpsons stuff. After dying twice in a row extremely early doors, I enabled gyro and made it to #2 on the third jump from the bus. First loser! It's a weird thing, Fortnite these days, but I did enjoy most of those 20 minutes. Maybe I'll dip back into that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> proves that every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow, just like in real life. While there has been zero progress since last weekend (except, of course, making Melinöe stronger with each demise), I hope to turn the tables this weekend. Lots of high adrenaline arcade action as well, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-tokyo-wars">Arcade Archives 2: Tokyo Wars</a>' bare-bones single player experience quickly turns into a frenetic split-screen multiplayer extravaganza (I miss Wii U’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tank_tank_tank">Tank! Tank! Tank!</a> …) and both Toaplan’s Arcade Collection volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 50 of 50 games played! The final five titles are all absolute stunners! 'Combatants' (clever pun!) is all bout real-time tactics with fighting ants, 'Quibble Race' finally made me understand Japanese obsession with horse racing simulations, 'Seaside Drive' is purest shmup bliss, 'Campanella 3' is the final game in the series and goes full <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> and to wrap up this package the multi-genre, 'Cyber Owls', which I hope to complete this weekend. What an incredible package, part of me wants 'Super UFO 50' to happen, with SNES-style graphics and music… one can dream!</p>
<p>My game of the week is Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Being a huge fan of this spin-off series and the added hardware strength of the Switch 2, I see nothing but a very good time ahead. Are you a person who finds the whole Musou gameplay strangely soothing and great stress relief? Just me?</p>

<p>I’ve got to admit, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has hooked me far more than I expected it would. The criticism about the sameness of the environments and the rather wooden NPCs is completely fair, but I still find it hard to put down. I particularly enjoy hunting for Alpha Pokémon and having an oversized critter following me around. The battle system feels fresh and fluid — and occasionally challenging, which makes for a nice change. I was genuinely taken aback by how good the Mega Dimensions DLC looks. It really seems to cater to high-level play, though I’m not exactly thrilled about the price point.</p>
<p>I’m also completely addicted to BALL x PIT. It gets me into that flow state I love, scratches the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> itch, and does something new and mechanically interesting that you don’t often see in other Survivors-likes. It’s such a fresh and satisfying gameplay loop.</p>
<p>I’ve also been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi’s Mansion</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. I missed it back in the day, but I can definitely see what people mean about the spooky atmosphere of this first entry compared with the next two in the series. The original just nails that haunted house vibe a bit better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, which is objectively a better game in almost every respect.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kill-team-dead-silence-review-hunter-vs-hunter.1347664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The current season of <em>Kill Team</em> continues with a new expansion featuring 2 new kill teams, both masters of covert operations, and a new campaign style to fight in.&nbsp;In this article, we'll take a look at how the new kill teams play and the new campaign style.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a>,&nbsp;or the set that kicked off this season, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Tomb World</a>.</p>






<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Dead Silence is an expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;and requires a copy of the <em>Kill Team</em> core rulebook, dice, and a measuring tool to use. The campaign is set in a Tomb World, so having a copy of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Tomb World</a> box will also give you the scenery to keep it thematic.</p>

<p>The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Dead Silence Dossier</li>
	<li>6x Adeptus Astartes Wolf&nbsp;Scout&nbsp;kill team miniatures (5x Space Marines and 1x Fenrisian Wolf)</li>
	<li>8x Tau Stealth Battlesuits kill team&nbsp;miniatures (5x Stealth Battlesuits, 2x Drones and 1x Beacon)</li>
	<li>Datacards and tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Campaign map and log pads</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-2.jpg?itok=0PtUsjJ0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-2.jpg?itok=hSNQ5VvK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The new map-based campaign, the Ctesiphus Campaign, sees players exploring a map, rolling randomly to determine the type of surface or tomb location, and then fighting a battle using the location rules that a kill team is on. Players can build camps, destroy other players' camps, and use supply points to move around the map. There are also rules for playing it using the solo/cooperative rules for <em>Kill Team</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-3.jpg?itok=navLyjUd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-3.jpg?itok=DddG9Uzx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Awoooo!</h2>

<p>The Space Wolves get their first dedicated kill team with the Wolf Scouts. This kill team, rather than being made up of novice Space Marine scouts like those from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-salvation-review-striking-scorpion-hidden-space-marine" rel="nofollow">Salvation</a>&nbsp;expansion, the Space Wolf Wolf Scouts are made up of veteran Space Marines, who prefer to operate independently, away from their brothers. They do serve the same purpose as the scouts in other chapters, taking on shadowy, clandestine operations, they're just a lot more deadly.</p>

<p>The Wolf Scout kill team is made up of 5 Wolf Scouts and a Ferisian Wolf, and has 6 operator choices, plus the standard Hunter, so you'll have to make a choice between them when selecting your kill team. You'll also have to make a choice when building them between the Pack Leader and Frosteye (but you can use the parts on another body if you wish), but if you want to build all 6 specialist operatives, plus a standard Hunter, you will need to pick up another set when they go on sale seperately, or get hold of another 2 Space Marine/Space Wolf bodies and use the extra components from this set.</p>

<p>When the Wolf Scouts go to battle, they bring the storm with them, which is represented by a token, and any operative within 6 inches of it activates any bonuses on their profile card. The Wolf Scout Gunner for example, ignores the hot rule on their supercharged plasma gun, and it gains the punishing rule, allowing you to turn a fail into a hit if you roll a critical.</p>

<p>My auto-take choices for the Wolf Scouts are the Fangbearer, who allows your entire kill team to ignore any stat modifiers from being wounded, even if they're incapacitated during the game, and the Frosteye, who can go on guard within your storm and remain concealed. I love the thematic rules for this storm-powered sniper, shooting from within a blizzard.</p>

<p>The Tau Empire is a group of technologically advanced alien species that look to collect others to their cause through peaceful means, but are happy to use violence if required. Their previous dedicated kill team was made up of Pathfinders, long-range reconnaissance operators. But now they get their first elite kill team, featuring Stealth Battlesuits, which make use of light-bending technology to remain invisible.</p>

<p>The Stealth Battlesuits kill team is made up of a Shas'vre, the leader, a marker drone and a gun drone, and a selection of 4 specialist operatives, or the standard Infiltrator operative. In the Dead Silence expansion, you get 5 miniatures, so you'll have to choose if you want to build all the specialists or drop some for standard Infiltrators. All operatives also have a choice of burst cannon, with high attacks that can reroll any results of 1, or up to 2 fusion cannons, which are shorter range but higher damage. So you will also have to make armament decisions before building your miniatures, or pick up more Stealth Suits to build the different options.</p>

<p>My favorite Stealth Battlesuit operatives are the Lodestar, who has a chance to gain bonus CP each turn, depending on how far the homing beacon is from your drop zone. My other favorite operative is the Designator, who can mark enemy operatives if they've a valid target, which gives any of your operatives targeting that enemy the option to turn a normal hit into a critical if you don't roll any crits at all. This doubles up with the gun drone to mark targets, which is especially helpful for making sure you get that Devastating 4 for auto wounds from the Fusion Blasters.</p>

<p>All the Stealth Battlesuits have stealth fields, which means when they have the conceal order, they're not visible to enemies more than 3 inches away from them, keeping them safe until they close the distance with the enemy, and are ready to attack.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Dead Silence contains 2 great new kill teams. Both have some great thematic play styles, with the invisible Battlesuits and the Wolf Scouts storm rules. Both factions are also masters at what they do, with the Wolf Scouts excelling in close combat and the Stealth Battlesuits being masters of range. They offer some great games against each other, and while the map-based campaign is a welcome addition to <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;campaigns, it would have been nice to have some thematic missions to play these teams off against each other and some more scenery to build up on the Tomb World set.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yet another MMO bites the dust as the Warhammer project in the works at Jackalyptic Games has been canceled following the studio's shutdown. The news comes directly from founder Jack Emmert, an MMO veteran who was behind City of Heroes, Champions Online, and Star Trek Online. </p>



<p>Later, he managed DC Universe Online while at Daybreak. When the DC Universe Online team <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-on-dimensional-inks-total-independence-and-whats-next-for-the-dcuo-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was spun off as Dimensional Ink Games in early 2020</a>, Emmert began working on an unannounced project that ultimately became a Marvel-based MMORPG. When that project <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-mmorpg-canceled-as-investment-is-refocused-on-smaller-projects-based-on-current-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got canceled</a> by Daybreak's parent company, Enad Global 7, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-games-launches-u-s-studio-jackalope-games-to-develop-pc-and-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established Jackalope Games</a> (later rebranded as Jackalyptic) with funding help from NetEase. In May 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-for-pc-console-in-development-at-jackalyptic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the Austin-based development team was working on an MMO based on a Warhammer IP.</p>



<p>A few days later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I spoke with Emmert</a>, who broadly mentioned that it would be an accessible game focused on properly representing the IP. The game designer is a lifelong fan of Warhammer, so that was one of his first mandates. Unfortunately, with NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down studios left and right</a>, Jackalyptic is only the latest team to be impacted. </p>



<p>Yesterday, Emmert announced the news <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7392684257858494464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the company's LinkedIn page</a>:</p>



<p><em>I’m here to share a note that after nearly three and a half years working with NetEase Games as a first party studio, our partnership will be coming to an end. We appreciate all the support NetEase Games has provided with their resources and engagement throughout this development process.</em></p>



<p><em>As we navigate this transition, our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities. If you’re looking for passionate, creative professionals who bring excellence and collaboration to everything they do, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We want to thank our community and all the individuals who have contributed to the project, and have made it something special.</em></p>



<p>It's yet another sad day for MMO fans after the closure of Amazon's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-development The Lord of the Rings project</a>, not to mention Fantastic Pixel Castle's Ghost MMO also vanishing into the air.</p>



<p>As for Warhammer, while the IP is very lively in the gaming space, 2008's Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning remains the only MMO made based on the fantasy franchise, and it was shut down in 2013 (though fans have been operating a private server called Return to Reckoning). The sci-fi universe Warhammer 40,000 received an MMO-like third-person shooter game titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-eternal-crusade-dated-for-pc-while-console-development-gets-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternal Cr</a>usade in 2016, but developer Behavior Interactive eventually closed the servers in September 2021 due to a lack of players.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-8-881/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-881-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-8.1347649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the weekend, but don’t feel like you can relax until you’ve completed today’s NYT Connections puzzle! I’ve got the solutions and NYT Connections hints you need to dominate today’s puzzle, which happens to be pretty tricky. Before you roll into your weekend, scroll down and get the answers I know you’re looking for.</p>



<p>NYT Connections hints await!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-8">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 8)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #881:</p>



<ul>
<li>SIGN</li>



<li>SPY</li>



<li>STOP</li>



<li>ROBOT</li>



<li>SEAL</li>



<li>BODY</li>



<li>DELIVER</li>



<li>PRESENT</li>



<li>BEAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>PROGRAMMING</li>



<li>CHING</li>



<li>GIVE</li>



<li>SPOKEN</li>



<li>CLOSE</li>



<li>PRONOUNCE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These all suggest <strong>obstructing or closing</strong> something</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word implies <strong>offering or stating something publicly</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all <strong>forms or systems of communication</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each of these can follow <strong>“I” </strong>to form a phrase</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 8.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-8-881">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 8 (#881)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CLOSE, PLUG, SEAL, STOP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DELIVER, GIVE, PRESENT, PRONOUNCE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BODY, PROGRAMMING, SIGN, SPOKEN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BEAM, CHING, ROBOT, SPY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 finally has a release date for when it’s coming to Xbox Series X|S, and it comes from an early update on the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>Though the listing has seemingly been removed, it’s been revealed—h/t <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/silent-hill-2-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">True Achievements</a> for finding it first—that Silent Hill 2 will launch on Xbox on Friday, November 21, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who’ve been following, an Xbox launch has <a href="http://long been rumor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a> and expected. Talk even picked up more steam when the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/">officially rated for Xbox</a> by the ESRB on October 31, meaning that a launch wasn’t going to be far off. </p>



<p>Looking at the store listing, it says the game is optimized for both the Xbox Series X and Series S. It will also release for the console and PC via the Microsoft Store. However, there’s no official mention of it being a play anywhere title.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Silent Hill 2 Microsoft Store Listing (Credit: True Achievements)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Silent Hill 2 first launched on PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024. The deal for the game to be console exclusive on the PS5 was for a year, which expired early last month. As of writing, the game has a “generally favorable” rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">86 on Metacritic</a> from 105 reviews while the user score is even higher at 9.1 from 3,998 user ratings.</p>



<p>In addition to Xbox, there have also been rumors that it will be released on the Nintendo Switch 2. Whether it happens on the same date as Xbox remains to be seen, but it’s clear that those without a PC or PS5 will be getting to play the remake from Bloober Team in the very near future.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting, though, that neither Konami nor Bloober Team have officially announced anything yet.</p>



<p>Now that we seemingly have a release date, will you pick up Silent Hill 2 on Xbox? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius has announced a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion for N7 Day. The tabletop publisher will be bringing new material for both <em>Mass Effect</em> fans and board game enthusiasts:<em>&nbsp;</em>more enemy miniatures and an official expansion&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>&nbsp;Expansion Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius made several announcements regarding a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion. The first announcement was for a new wave of miniatures. These sets will provide unpainted resin miniatures of different Mass Effect enemies to use in your game if the base experience's cardboard tokens aren't cutting it for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-expansion-atlas-mech-miniature.jpg?itok=dLmQhkD_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-expansion-atlas-mech-miniature.jpg?itok=Hwig3Axn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The line of miniatures coming in Q2 of 2026 is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Priority Threats Delta</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Gamma</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Epsilon</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Alpha</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Beta</li>
	<li>ATLAS Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>YMIR Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>Brute and Marker</li>
</ul><p>The second, more notable announcement is confirmation that the studio is working on an official expansion. This will introduce six new squadmates, new loyalty missions, and new locations. At the time of writing, the exact details on the expansion's contents, release date, or price, is unknown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> series was created by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts in 2008. It followed Commander Shepard, a custom player character, as they explored a vast sci-fi universe with unique aliens, factions, and history. The unique selling point was that you could import your save data from each game, with your choices and partnerships having widespread consequences as the series progressed.</p>

<p>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>, aka <em>Mass Effect: Project Hagalaz</em>, released last year. It is a cooperative game set during the events of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and follows Commander Shepard and their crew on a mission involving Cerberus and The Reapers. The game was designed by Eric Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>) and Calvin Wang Tze Loon.</p>

<p>The game garnered a bit of controversy at launch. Namely, a culture war spat regarding squadmates' personal pronouns being featured in the game. This led to a series of review bombing on Board Game Geek, Lang being harassed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">off social media</a>, and pronouns being removed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/czech-release-of-mass-effect-board-game-will-remove-squadmate-pronouns" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Czech version</a> of the game.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> launches for the Switch and Switch 2 next week, and in case you missed it, players who purchase the Switch release will be able to update their game to play an "enhanced version" on the Switch 2 system.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco explains on its website (and in the video above) how you'll be able to do this by simply connecting your Switch 2 system to the internet and then downloading the update. After this, the characters and backgrounds in the game will appear with "improved clarity and richer detail".</p>
<p>When applying this update, certain save data - including battle replay data, edit data and online records cannot be carried over. As for battles, you'll be able to play with users on Switch 2 and other Switch players who have this same update applied.</p>
<p>Below is a look at the Switch version before the update, after the update, and how the game looks on Switch 2:</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Square Enix disclosed its ambition to drastically cut its Quality Assurance employees and use generative AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">handle 70% of its game QA and debugging</a>. The company went on to note that it wants to "establish a competitive advantage in game development." However, Michael Douse--the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian--has called out Square Enix and described its plan as "stupid."</p><p>"So QA are some of the most video games engaged people in any company," Douse wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986535697809854640" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>. "They are integral to your community teams. To publishing. They give you the real feedback. They know what is good and what is bad before the audience does, and they are the most resilient department."</p><p>"[The] idea that QA people can be replaced at a large scale is stupid because it supposes that the conversations with them can be replaced and they can't," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1986536143953781040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added Douse</a>. "They are a massively advantageous vibe check."</p><p>Douse also noted that QA jobs have often been gateway positions for people looking to get into the video game industry. He cautions that losing QA workers risks missing out on future designers and other positions.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986537291645374734" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">QA is not an inherently entry-level job but I will also add that without gateways to the industry you won't find your lead designers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Halo Infinite is ending after four years of updates, confirms Halo Studios. However, it seems the company is putting the teams on multiple new Halo projects, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>



<p>The Halo franchise has been at the forefront of the FPS genre since its debut in 2001 on Xbox. With several entries, the series has become synonymous with gamers alike for its epic space setting and thrilling gunplay. With the 30th anniversary coming up, Halo Studios is going all in, starting with the recently-revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of 2001’s Combat Evolved. Unfortunately, the most recent title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-qa-tester-blames-microsofts-policies-for-halo-infinite-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a>, is ending production, but it will lead to new projects in the works.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post from Halo Studios</a>, the team announced that <strong>Halo Infinite’s newest update</strong>, Operation: Infinite, <strong>will be its last major one</strong>. The update, set to go live on November 18th, 2025, will include new armor, maps, challenges, and 2x XP. Unfortunately, it’s the final one for the game, as, in the blog, the team states,</p>



<p>“<strong>With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us</strong>,” the blog reads. “<strong>While we remain committed to supporting&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>&nbsp;on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned</strong>.”</p>



<p>Fortunately, it seems the Halo Infinite team is shifting to help on other Halo games currently in the works. We only know of one, Halo: Campaign Evolved, so <strong>this does confirm more is in development at Halo Studios</strong>. There are rumors that a live-service Halo game is planning to release in 2026, so perhaps it’s one of the titles it’s working on. Of course, one can also assume the next mainline entry is in production, though no confirmation has been made for either project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Halo Infinite ending support? Are you excited to see what Halo Studios has in store? What game do you hope is next? Mainline? Multiplayer? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> presents you with plenty of quests that require you to find materials or unique items, but only a few require you to use your materials to complete them. Eyes on the Prize, however, is one such quest that expects you to bring along a little something to help you get the job done. Let's jump in and see what's what.</p><p><strong>You'll need 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> and complete Eyes on the Prize. Wires are a common resource found in Electrical-based POIs, and within a few hours of gameplay, you should've already amassed quite a collection--unless you've been selling them. Whether you're tossing them into your inventory before you head out or finding them while in the raid, just make sure you have 3 of them before you head to the secluded roof terrace for Eyes on the Prize. And make sure you toss them in a safe pocket if possible, as you never know when things could go wrong, and you don't want to lose them.</p><p>When you're ready to repair a solar panel, here's how to complete Eyes on the Prize.</p><h2>Where to find the secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station</h2><p>The first objective in Eyes on the Prize is to find a secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station extraction point. The quest mentions to keep an eye out for a blue tarp, but it can still be hard to spot if you're not at the right angle. With that in mind, refer to the photo below for the exact location on the map.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598921,1300-4598922" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You'll need to be on the roof to reach the secluded roof terrace (as per the name). You'll eventually spot a blue tarp with some chairs, boxes, and an electric box. That's your destination.</p><h2>How to rewire the solar panel</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, <strong>you'll need to have brought or scavenged 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> at the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace. If you didn't bring any in with you, you'll either have to recycle an electrical item like a Battery or visit an Electrical-based POI on the map to round a few up.</p><p>As long as you have the 3 Wires in your inventory, you can approach the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace and interact with it to finish your repairs like a proper electrician. With that out of the way, the Eyes on the Prize quest will conclude.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920"></a><figcaption>Repair the solar panel using 3 Wires.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Since you don't need to extract to complete the quest, you're now free to finish looting or shooting until you're ready to leave. The nearby Southern Station should prove to be a solid spot to extract when you're finished up, though. Just keep in mind that it tends to be an active region of the map, so don't let your guard down.</p><p>If you need to tackle more quests, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.</p><p>You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.</p><p>When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.</p><h2>Where to find a beehive for the Bees! quest</h2><p>To collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932" data-ratio="0.56135770234987" data-width="1149" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932"></a><figcaption>Find the beehive here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933"></a><figcaption>Interact with the beehive to pick it up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg"></figure><p>With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full quest list</a> for you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anyone who makes videos or podcasts for a living knows that the impact of audio comes above just about everything else. Seriously, if your sound quality is good enough, then everything else is often secondary, and that’s why having really good microphones is so important. If you’re looking for an amazing option, then you’ll want to get a good lavalier microphone, because they’re a lot more subtle in appearance while providing excellent sound quality.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has a deal on which means that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">DJI Mic Mini is currently on sale with 38% off, which means it’s down to $74 for a limited time:</a>&nbsp;It’s normally $119, so that’s a decent discount for sure. Not only that, but <strong>this comes with two transmitters and one receiver</strong>, so you can even use this for duo productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Mic Check</h2>
<p>The microphones here are incredibly light, weighing in at only ten grams, which means that you’ll not only be able to connect them to just about any bit of clothing, but also not be weighed down by them. That means you’ll look better on camera, but it also means you can fine-tune the placement to get the perfect sound quality, no matter what environment you’re recording in.</p>



<p>They also feature amazing noise cancelling, with you being able to switch modes as needed. Basic will get rid of standard noises you’d expect, but strong can handle all sorts of sounds. It means that you’ll be getting crystal clear audio at all times, and that’s really important. The microphones have an amazing range of 400m as well, so you can set this up indoors then go outside to record as needed.</p>
<p>The battery life is also very impressive. You can keep these on for up to 10 hours in total, which means that you can record for an entire work day without any problems. That’s plenty of time for a huge number of takes, interviews, or different video or audio ideas as you need. These are small, mighty, and long-lasting microphones that are sure to make you sound better, no matter what you’re using them for.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant discount, but it’s also one that we’re not expecting to last for very long. So, if you do want to enjoy this amazing price tag, we recommend doing so soon. The $74 could run out at any time, and that means time is of the essence if you want to save big and sound good.</p>

                <p>Everyone needs a pick-me-up sometimes--maybe even more so if they're living underground after devastating losses to an army of machines. In the Espresso quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll need to go topside and seek out an espresso maker from a cafe in Buried City. If you're wondering where exactly to go for this caffeine fix, we've got you covered.</p><p>You'll need to extract from Buried City and return to Speranza with the espresso machine in your inventory to complete the mission, so it's smart to bring along an augment with a safe pocket to store the quest item in. A good gun and shield for protection can't hurt, either.</p><p>When you're ready to get the espresso machine, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the espresso machine in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The espresso machine is located in a cafe in Plaza Rosa in the southern portion of the Buried City map. This area is often swarming with ARC, so it can be a challenge to get in and out unnoticed, especially if you're also dealing with other raiders questing or looting in the vicinity. Don't be afraid to take things slow when approaching to stay unnoticed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598913" data-ratio="0.57222222222222" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598913"></a><figcaption>Cafe location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>The cafe is a red building with a "cafe" sign just above the door.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598918-19a60513aee38-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598918" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598918-19a60513aee38-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598918"></a><figcaption>The cafe is a red building with a cafe sign above the door.

Pick it up to add it to your inventory. Afterward, feel free to loot the cafe for any additional items before you extract.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598915-19a605148c947-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598915" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598915-19a605148c947-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598915"></a><figcaption>Pick up the espresso machine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598915-19a605148c947-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>With the espresso machine obtained, you'll now need to successfully extract with it if you want to complete the quest. You're in luck, though, because the Souther Station extraction point is literally right in front of the cafe. Just walk outside and drop (or zipline) down into the broken section of the ground, then press the button, wait for the train, and get out of the Buried City alive. You deserve a cup of coffee for all of that hard work.</p><p>If you're stuck on anything else, we've got plenty more quest guides in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Lance loves to send you out looking for stuff in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, and the A New Type of Plant quest is no different. In this outing, you'll be tasked with finding a possibly toxic plant growing in the Old Battleground area of the Dam Battlegrounds map, then bringing it back to Lance at Speranza. </p><p>You'll be required to extract from the map with the quest to finish A New Type of Plant, so it's a good idea to come equipped with a loadout that you feel comfortable with--especially one with a safe pocket. Equip a decent gun (it's best to prioritize one for human opponents in this case) and make sure you've stocked up on some ammo and healing items before you head in--just in case you need to fend off any attackers while trying to extract.</p><p>When you're ready to get raiding, here's how to complete A New Type of Plant.</p><h2>Where to find the Baron Husk</h2><p>The first objective you have in A New Type of Plant is to located the Baron Husk. This giant fallen ARC can be found in the Old Battleground section on the far western side of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This husk isn't particularly hard to spot, as it's a giant metal monstrosity that has clearly seen better days.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864" data-ratio="0.56460044809559" data-width="1339" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864"></a><figcaption>Old Battleground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>This area isn't known for being particularly heavy on foot traffic, but it's still a good idea to keep an eye out for other raiders. A simple "don't shoot!" might stand between you and grabbing your quest item, after all.</p><h2>Where to find the toxic plant</h2><p>The toxic plant has plenty of spawns around the Baron Husk area. It looks somewhat similar to the Great Mullein plant you've already had to gather for Lance's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-doctors-orders-quest-guide/1100-6536044/" data-ref-id="1100-6536044">Doctor's Orders quest</a>, except this one has orange blooms that are rather visually striking. If you're struggling to find the plants, check for directly next to the husk until you round one up. Make sure you loot it!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863"></a><figcaption>Make sure to add the plant to your inventory and take it back to Speranza.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you've picked up the toxic plant, you'll need to extract. If you brought an augment with a safe pocket, make sure you toss the quest item in there to keep it safe in case you run into trouble. Either way, head east to the Central Swamp Lift. This area is often crawling with ARC and frequently camped by other raiders, so don't be afraid to take things nice and slow--and keep your wits about you. You'll be back in Speranza in no time where you can turn in your quest to Lance.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

Celeste's quest Digging Up Dirt is no different--though figuring out how to get to the dead drop she's asked you to retrieve can be a little tricky. In this guide, we'll fill you in on how to reach the dead drop inside the Santa Maria Houses so you can finish up the Digging Up Dirt quest.</p><p>For this quest, you won't need to extract to receive credit. As such, you can always enter the map using a free loadout to reduce the pain of death should some ARC or other raider put a quick end to you.

              <p data-start="0" data-end="468">Now that we’re in the last two months of the year, the doors are wide open for all the holiday shopping you need to take care of. If you’re still on the hunt for some gifts for a friend, family member, or loved one, you might want to consider this Fitbit Inspire 3 health and fitness tracker. It’s not even Black Friday yet, but the GPS-enabled wristwatch is already on sale with Black Friday-level prices. It normally sells for $99, but for a limited time you can pick it up on sale for 30% off: Some <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5395/">quick napkin math will tell you that’s a $30 savings, bringing the price you pay to just $69</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>


<p data-start="0" data-end="468">The Fitbit Inspire 3 is you’re own personal trainer right on your wrist, there to help you whether you’re out for a run or grinding through a session in the gym. With over 20 exercise modes to choose from, it automatically kicks into workout tracking when it senses you’re getting active. You can even connect it to your phone’s GPS to track your distance and pace when you’re outside. Want to keep tabs on your stats while lifting, kayaking, or biking? Maybe post to Strava so you can get all your precious kudos? Do it with the Fitbit Inspire 3.</p>
<p data-start="470" data-end="894">The Inspire 3 monitors your heart rate around the clock and can measure the intensity of your workouts, letting you know when you’re in the fat burn, cardio, or peak zones. This way you can fine-tune your workouts accordingly. Plus, it can help you stay on top of your health by checking for signs of irregular rhythm that could point to atrial fibrillation (AFib). It even tracks things like blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, and more.</p>


<h2 data-start="896" data-end="1274">Sleep Better, Wake Better</h2>
<p data-start="896" data-end="1274">The Fitbit Inspire 3 can gently wake you up with a vibration during your lightest sleep stage, so you start your day feeling refreshed instead of groggy. It also gives you a sleep score and breaks down your light, deep, and REM stages, along with your sleeping heart rate, to help you understand your sleep patterns and improve your habits over time.</p>
<p data-start="1276" data-end="1465">Need a little nudge to move more? The Inspire 3 has your back there too. If you’ve been sitting for too long, it’ll send a friendly buzz reminding you to stretch your legs and get moving.</p>
<p data-start="1467" data-end="1699">This wristwatch isn’t just to help you tackle physical wellness, but mental wellness too. You can see your daily stress management score, based on factors like heart rate and daily activity, and take guided breathing sessions to help you reset and relax.</p>
