			<p>What is life? It’s a simple question, yet it has been a cornerstone of philosophy and religion for as long as people have pondered existence. From this question, more arise, with debates carried out about the meaning of life as well as what we classify as life. Threefold Recital takes this fundamental question and makes it the centre of its experience. Threefold Recital is less a game about philosophy and more a philosophical journey in the guise of a game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Threefold Recital Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0MYx0Cb_xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Threefold Recital’s story finds it origin in a debate between a Daoist priest and Buddhist monk, which attracts the wild animals around them to listen. Three of these animals, a wolf, a fox, and a snake ponder this debate so much that they become Beastlings, which are humanoid versions of themselves.</p>


<p>As part of their change and affiliations, each has an ability. Triratna is the wolfling that became a Buddhist monk, and his powers are based upon karma. He can see karma lines which can be severed to remove obstacles, and affinity lines to see the relationship between people and items. Taiqing is the fox turned Daoist priest who can create items and travel through dimensions. Transia is the snake who becomes an artist, blessed with the ability to travel through paintings and to apply bodypaint so she can disguise herself as other characters.</p>
<p>These three characters live in the city of Bluescales, a place once ruled by nine or ten dragon emperors, depending on who you ask. However, most of these dragon emperors are now dead and Bluescales’ glory has faded with them. They all know each other, but for the majority of Threefold Recital each is on their own path dealing with their own quests including solving a murder and learning the secret of an old theatre. Much of the gameplay consists of speaking to different characters, interacting with items in the world, and solving puzzles.</p>


<p>Triratna’s path is the most hands-on in this regard due to the severing of karma lines. These puzzles consist of lines and knots that must be cut in order. They get harder as new line types are added, including fuse lines that will explode and reset some of the puzzle. The lines will also move around as you try to cut them. These puzzles become a lesson in patience, requiring you to focus on smaller elements to break the larger picture. Taiqing and Transia’s puzzles are more environmentally based, requiring you to figure out the way forward by finding specific items or talking with the right characters at the right time.</p>
<p>Threefold Recital incorporates a lot of religious and philosophy within its game design. The prologue is set at the end of the game which you circle back to eventually, echoing the concept of Samsara within Buddhism which is an endless circle of life and death with no fixed end or beginning. When Taiqing enters another dimension, it stands for the yin and yang of Daoism, switching between black and white to see and hear information. These pieces of information are almost never fully whole as they are only part of the circle. For Transia, much of her adventure deals with the question of life and what it really means. It posits questions such as are you alive if only a handful of people know you exist, or if you were put together instead of being born in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>Threefold Recital is a fun game that has enough variety in its puzzles that none become stale, from the severing of karma lines to donning the right disguise to gather information. The art style fits the narrative well, with art itself being another central theme to Threefold Recital. It has a kind of chibi style for its characters, but then there are artworks within that are inspired by East Asian styles. The soundtrack provides added depth too, from enjoyable environmental tracks to others that set the mood from calm to action, and even a bit of partying. Extras can be collected, such as music tracks, character information, and items, all of which can be viewed in a base that is accessible between chapters. You earn karmarines which can be then used in a turn machine that drops out items. Karmarines are earned by completing side and main quests as well as challenges.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Threefold Recital is part-game, part-philosophy lesson and it's been made with a lot of heart. The three main characters all stand out well, and the story is generally good, even if it becomes a little too twisty in the middle. That aside, Threefold Recital marks a strong start for the 2025 indie scene.	</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ranking-units-from-the-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box.1080876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop sent us along a brand new box of their <em>Warhammer 40K</em>&nbsp;Death Korps of Krieg Army Box, and I set to work reading through the rules (the box contains data cards and a nice glossy version of the Astra Militarum Codex) and checking out the models. Now that I've got a good handle on everything, let's run through a quick ranking of the models in the Army Box.</p>

<h2>#4 - Death Riders</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=nk37L9oj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=vSKukE9W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Death Riders gallop in at the top of our list! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, okay... here's the big secret with this list: all of the models included in this Army Box are pretty damn good. But I set out to challenge myself to rank them from "worst" to "best." So I'm shocking even myself by saying that the Death Riders - while looking extremely cool on their enhanced Krieg Steeds - don't quite live up to the excitement of the rest of the models in the box.</p>

<p>With a 10" move (doesn't that feel a little slow for cavalry? The Attilan Rough Riders have a 12" move) and bearing a lascarbine and a frag lance, they're fine at a distance, but nothing extraordinary. They also have a power sabre and their steeds' claws for when you're done charging. They also have a special ability "Screening Line," allowing them to make a Normal 6" move whenever an enemy gets within 9" of them.</p>

<p>None of this is bad, in fact they can be quite a handful on the table... but there's just not much too them!</p>

<h2>#3 - Lord Marshal Dreir</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=ru9Egrl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=Rm6Jm5Vv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lord Marshal leads from horseback, hard to get him into a tank! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Hmm... maybe I'm just a horse hater? Coming in at number three is Lord Marshal Dreir, an epic hero and officer for Krieg who can be attached to the aforementioned Death Riders. He's also got a 10" move, and has 6 wounds. Those 6 wounds aren't as bad as they sound, as he has "Feel No Pain 6+" and the "Tough To Kill" special ability which basically allows you to re-set him up if he's destroyed by rolling a 2 or better once per game.</p>

<p>Not too shabby! Add to that his "Leading the Charge" special ability, which gives his unit's melee weapons the "Devastating Wounds" ability (crits can't be invuln saved against). Speaking of weapons, he is an infantry chopper with his Sabre of Sacrifice, which has Anti-Infantry 4+ (pairing nicely with the Devastating Wounds from a charge).</p>

<p>But that's... pretty much it for him. Yes, he has the ability to give up to 3 Orders to his units, but other than that he's just armed with a laspistol. For a character larger than life like Dreir, it would have been nice to see him kitted out a bit more.</p>

<h2>#2 - Kreig Combat Engineers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=KaCymLlK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=DJoPc0sg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Now THIS is what I think of when I think about Death Korps! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Now we're talkin'! Of all the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Death Korps units included in this box, the Krieg Combat Engineers bring a lot of flexibility and some serious firepower. Each model comes with a standard Auto pistol and trench club, but you can upgrade individual models with flamers, combat shotguns, and more to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Also, these little dudes are meant to get moving on the battlefield with their "Scout 6"" ability, and their "Remote Mine" ability (which sports an incredible miniature to serve as a marker) can really do some damage. It reads: "Once per battle, at the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one enemy unit within 12" of the bearer and roll one D6: on a 3+, that enemy unit suffers D6 mortal wounds, or D3+3 mortal wounds instead if it is a Vehicle or Fortifications unit." OUCH!</p>

<p>I also love the look of them... maybe that's one of the reasons I'm instantly drawn to them. Krieg just look kinda off on horses. They should be crawling on their bellies through razorwire, not galloping on mutated horses!</p>

<h2>#1 - Artillery Team</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=4o-Ew-eD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=fHEX1Ng8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When you truly need to bring the BOOM! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's get to the most gorgeous model in the set - and in my opinion the one that packs the most punch! While not tied specifically to Death Korps, the Artillery Team model is a slow-rolling source of death for all unlucky enough to fall within its sights. While it only has a 3" move, as you'd expect from an Artillery Team, the unit has a 7 toughness, a 3+ save, and 10 wounds!</p>

<p>But what really makes this so nasty is the choice of builds here. You can build the Artillery Team with a Heavy Mortar (pictured), a siege cannon, a heavy quad launcher, or a multiple rocket launcher. Siege and heavy quad are fun options, but for me it's all about either the heavy mortar (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 8 strength, -1 AP, 2 Damage per hit) or the multiple rocket launcher (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 2 strength, -1 AP, 1 Damage per hit).</p>

<p>If you're looking to punch through heavy armor, take the high-strength heavy mortar. But if you want to whittle down infantry, the multiple rocket launcher has Anti-Infantry 3+ (meaning you wound infantry on a wound roll of 3 or better!) and is a really strong option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No matter the build, you add to that the "Remorseless Barage" ability which reads: "In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot, if one or more of those attacks made with an Indirect Fire weapon [Giaco's note: all the options have Indirect Fire] scored a hit against an enemy unit, that unit must take a Battle-shock test (if an Infantry unit is hit by one or more attacks made by a multiple rocket launcher, they must subtract 1 from their Battle-shock test when doing so)."</p>

<p>So those are my rankings! How wrong am I? Please sound off in the comments and show me the error of my ways!</p>

Average Lucia Fanatic went onto claim the full console would be released by March, with <em>Mario Kart 9</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> as launch games. NateTheHate suggested a hardware launch would come closer to May or June. </p><p>Whether these are rumors based on actual sources or just reasonable guesses, this week certainly <em>feels</em> ripe for a Switch 2 announcement. We’re just coming off a bananas CES 2025 conference swirling with messy rumors and 3D printed mock-ups of the console, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genkis-ces-booth-over-switch-2-mockup&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genkis-ces-booth-over-switch-2-mockup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo’s lawyers even allegedly confronting one Switch 2 accessory manufacturer</a></span> over its unofficial renders of the upcoming device shared on the showroom floor. </p><p>Nintendo has already promised to reveal the console before April.

And if the Switch 2 somehow doesn’t get revealed by the end of the week, I can only imagine how much worse the leaks will get after that. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

RIP <em>GTA San Andreas</em>’ Big Smoke as Punisher and CJ as Winter Soldier.</p><p>Naturally, it only took a few days for fans to find a workaround. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dexerto</em> notes</a></span>, there are essentially two techniques for bypassing <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ new asset hash check. The first incorporates the modded files directly into the game’s .pak files rather than separately through a mod manager. It’s a much bigger hoop than most players will want to jump through, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YskRnb4-Wyc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YskRnb4-Wyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but it works</a></span>. </p><p>The second method is a bit more straightforward, but requires a very beefy SSD. It seemingly revolves around unpacking and repacking files quickly enough to skirt the new checks, and comes with the risk of overheating your PC as a result. “You can just extract the pak files like a zip and run them unpaked,” reads <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new how-to by prafit1111 over on <em>NexusMods</em></a></span>. “The problem is, the game is loading 50,000 files versus 1 so this can be quite problematic even on the fastest SSDs. Using a solution like this could even make your SSD die faster.”</p><p>Plus, even if you don’t corrupt your game install or kill a piece of your rig, continuing to mess around with mods still risks permanently losing access to your account and all the cosmetics you’ve already purchased or unlocked. “It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned,” NetEase recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> in a statement.

This installment is billed as having “the most exhilarating action in the series' history,” Dynasty Warriors: Origins also harnesses the power of modern gaming hardware to pit your character against the most onscreen enemies ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you want to know why it’s so good, in IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review">Dynasty Warriors: Origins review</a>, critic Jada Griffin wrote:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dynasty Warriors: Origins Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Rather, it’s a brand new game, something Larian was keen to move on to after trying and failing to spark enthusiasm internally for a Baldur's Gate follow-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-teases-next-big-game-as-xbox-announcement-nears"><u>Vincke spoke in vague terms about the studio’s next project</u></a>. “I wish I could tell you about our next big game but this is really encouraging us to ensure it pushes many boundaries,” Vincke teased in response to Baldur’s Gate 3’s many The Game Awards nominations. “I’m very excited about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July 2023, ahead of Baldur’s Gate 3’s explosive launch, Vincke told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-will-definitely-make-a-divinity-original-sin-sequel-but-not-before-a-well-earned-break"><u>a sequel to Larian’s own Divinity: Original Sin series is on the cards</u></a> too, although fans shouldn’t hold their breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's our own universe we built, so we're definitely gonna get back there at some point,” Vincke said. “We will get back there at some point. We'll first finish [Baldur's Gate 3], and then take a break, because we will need to refresh ourselves creatively also. You’re seeing 400 developers putting their heart and souls into this. You’re getting the best of them and their craft into this game. And so I can tell you, it's quite a thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Divinity isn’t next, perhaps a brand new game set in a completely different universe? Larian has created fantasy RPGs for some time now. Could it branch out into science fiction? Or a modern day setting? Or maybe even try a new genre?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like it may be some time — years even — before we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Some of the films that have succeeded the most, including 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, were created in partnership with the game developers themselves.

The same is true for the Horizon Zero Dawn film. As for Until Dawn, though, it wrapped filming in 2024 and is coming out this April, with Peter Stormare returning from the game.</p>

            <p>Bungie's all-new IP, codenamed Gummy Bears, is a team-based competitive MOBA that has now been handed over to a brand-new PlayStation studio.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/">The Game Post</a>, which said that about 40 Bungie developers are working with the new studio to expand the "vibrant and colourful" Super Smash Bros-esque game to "attract a younger audience" and diversify both its portfolio and audience. According to sources, it's been in development for around three years and is getting "overwhelmingly positive feedback".</p>

<p>There's more, too. The report hints that "multiple" anonymous sources claim Gummy Bears' players "won't have traditional health bars" but instead use a "percentage-based damage system where characters are knocked back further based on how much damage" they take or inflict.</p>
<p>We're told it'll be a "lo-fi and cosy" competitive PvP team-based game with the fundamentals of a MOBA and splashes of Smash Bros.</p>
<p>There'll be several modes and three class types, including Support, Attack, and Defense. Interestingly, players will also be able to "hang out with friends in-between matches and express <em>their</em> identities in the game".</p>
<p>We've reached out to PlayStation for comment about both the game itself and the mysterious new studio developing it - we'll let you know as/when it comes back to us.</p>
<p>Presumably it won't be adapted from the '80s Disney cartoon of the same name pictured above... but we'll see, I guess?!</p>
<p>As for Bungie itself? Almost exactly a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">it was reported</a> Bungie had delayed its sci-fi extraction shooter Marathon into 2025, the studio released a gameplay-free developer update saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">the game is "on track", albeit a "little early to show"</a> - and that it'll "reveal a lot more" later this year.</p>
<p>The update marked the first promotional push from Bungie after it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laid off 220 staff</a> - roughly 17 percent of its workforce - in July 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Skyscraper-sized reptile king Godzilla will soon be unleashed on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s battle royale map, as a quick snippet of gameplay footage released today shows. 
</p>
<p>
We've known since December that Godzilla was set to take a starring role this season - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-leaks-point-to-godzilla-crossover">smaller-sized version is also coming as a skin, as part of the current battle pass</a>. But this is the first time we've seen him actually stomping around the map in actual gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
It looks as if ol' Godzilla will be a giant roaming boss - similar to last year's climactic Doctor Doom fight, where all players banded together to take down the Marvel villain. Quite how it'll work here remains to be seen.

And in other Fortnite news, developer Epic Games has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">now made its crossover with Hatsune Miku official</a>. The virtual popstar icon will front the next season of the game's musical Fortnite Festival mode.
</p>
<p>
The next Music Pass will include a Fortnite crossover version of Hatsune Miku, including a variant style themed to look like the game's Brite Bomber fan favourite skin, plus various themed virtual instruments and other accessories. A classic Hatsune Miku skin will also be available to buy separately.

            <p>Alarmo - Nintendo's bespoke alarm clock, which offers users the chance to wake up with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">collection of noises from games like Mario and Zelda</a> - was set for a general public release this January. However, that is no longer happening.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, Nintendo revealed Alarmo will remain a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">timed exclusive for those Nintendo Switch Online members</a> until "early" March.</p>
<p>"After that, it will be available to buy from selected retailers in certain countries," a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-europe">Nintendo of Europe</a> X post reads. "Thank you for your understanding."</p>

<p>Word of today's Alarmo delay follows news in December that the gizmo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-no-longer-publicly-launching-99-alarmo-clock-in-japan-this-january">would not be released publicly in Japan during the originally planned timeframe</a>. Writing last month, Nintendo blamed its "production and inventory situation" for this decision.</p>

<p>Alarmo retails for £90 here in the UK, but is it worth it?</p>
<p>"As it is, it feels like Alarmo has untapped potential and too high a price tag as a result. I understand the attraction of keeping things simple, and I can also understand a need to be cautious around what an internet-connected device tracks in people's bedrooms," our Tom wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Eurogamer's Alarmo review</a>.</p><p>"But, for now, Alarmo costing £90 makes it hard to recommend.

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Dynasty Warriors Origins</h5><p><span>January 17th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><span>As the one known as Zliuan, players take up arms as a young warrior whose village lineage has typically been to operate from the shadows and provide hidden support to help dictate the flow of battle. Long before <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/">Dynasty Warrior Origins</a> begins, the story has been established that the village from which Ziluan hails has been known for producing a force of change known as the Guardians of Peace. These not-assassins operate from the shadows and do what must be done to keep tyrants from getting out of line and generally guiding the populace towards a particular goal. While this endgame is not immediately known to the player, the way that the Guardians of Peace are woven together with the formation of the three kingdoms that would eventually lead into the tale of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms makes even the most familiar of story beats into something fresh and exciting.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The story of Dynasty Warriors Origins opens with Ziluan as a sort of mercenary for hire with no allegiance to any of the major kingdoms, only in quiet service to the Emperor himself. Along the way, he allies himself with Guan Yu first before becoming introduced to the other key players across Cao Cao, Sun Jian, and Liu Bei’s distinct factions. As is typical for nearly every other Dynasty Warriors title, it’s the defeat of Zhang Jiao and the Yellow Turban Rebellion that truly kicks off the story and establishes the major players as proper musou warriors. The first three (of five total) chapters follow the story from the Yellow Turban Rebellion up through Cao Cao’s rescue of Emperor Xian. It isn’t until the fourth and fifth chapters that players can ally themselves with one of the three factions. Upon completing the main story for the first time, players can enjoy a new difficulty, an additional weapon type, weapon crafting/upgrading systems, and the ability to jump back into the timeline and ally with another faction or perhaps complete some secret missions objectives to divert the story into a ‘What if..?’ scenario and earn progress towards a true ending.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Not even Dynasty Warriors Origins has been able to escape the formulaic approach that the Musou series is known for. As but a simple one-man-wrecking-ball, players will take field against hundreds, if not thousands, of enemy troops per battlefield, many often dispatched in only a couple of attacks. It’s the sort of power fantasy that players have come to expect from Omega Force. Enemy officers and generals are the ones that offer up a true challenge unless playing on the highest of difficulty levels and even then, a careful approach to the dodge and parrying mechanics introduced into Dynasty Warriors Origins can turn the tide of battle against even the most acclaimed of generals.</span></p>
<p><span>MIssion objectives range from taking over one or more bases or defeating key enemy officers for most missions, both story and sidequests. Main story missions offer a fair bit of complexity to mix things up from the main dozen or so missions per playthrough. Usually these follow more of the canon established by the Romance of the Three Kingdoms mythos, beginning with The Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating around the Battle of Chibi where Zhuge Liang’s fire tactics made history in more ways than one. It’s this decisive battle that forms the eventual Three Kingdoms era, so many of the battles and familiar faces that players may recognize from later battles don’t make an appearance. Sorry, but that includes leaving out Meng Huo and his elephants.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Morale and Fortitude are two core mechanics to this latest entry of Dynasty Warriors Origins. Jumping into a fresh battlefield will usually put the player faction at a disadvantage which can be rectified by actions such as defeating an enemy officer or capturing a base. Morale in particular ties directly into how difficult an enemy officer can be to best in combat. When Morale is high for the opposing force, it adds on additional bars of Fortitude to the enemy’s strength. Typically the easiest method to defeat an enemy officer is to deplete their fortitude with repeated attacks or perfectly timed parries/dodges and initiate an Assault attack by pressing the Triangle button once fully depleted to do a massive combo attack that can oftentimes defeat lesser enemy officers in a single use. On the flip side, this draws out fights against enemy officers by lessening the amount of damage that they take from regular or musou special attacks and leaving the primary source of damage as these Assault moves.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To break up the monotony and repetition of the hack-and-slash mass battles that the series is known for, Dynasty Warriors Origins gives players a few unique tools that have rarely been seen in prior titles. Midway through the story, regardless of which of the three factions that Ziluan allies with, he will gain the ability to command a small squad that accompanies him as if he were a full-fledged officer. These AI units will attack on their own but can also be directly commanded via Tactics. These Tactics operate on time-based cooldowns and allow Ziluan up to three different unique abilities, such as firing a volley of flaming arrows and charging into the enemy line by horseback.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s a bit strange to have featured as a major mechanic, especially as Ziluan grows in strength and can dispatch an entire squad of enemy grunt soldiers in a single attach, but Dynasty Warriors Origins bills the established cast of the Three Kingdoms as these all-powerful warlords that can level the battlefield in a single attack. Because of this, they’re treated as some sort of ultimate move and can be swapped to upon filling their respective meter. For a couple of minutes, players can rampage the battlefield as one of their allied officers as an invincible, unstoppable force and culminating in a true musou attack upon completion that can easily rack up enemy KO’s in the hundreds. Many of these officers are the very same that they’ll be fighting alongside during the campaign missions, but there is one fan favorite that’s unlocked upon completing the game for the first time that can be used when replaying any earlier mission.</span></p>
<p><span>Rather than simply jumping from one mission to the next with a minor bit of exposition in between as is the series’ tradition, Dynasty Warriors Origins presents an open world for players to run around while keeping the battles themselves confined to separate stages. Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have reverted the changes they brought to players with Dynasty Warriors 9 where battles took place on that open field. As Ziluan runs about the field by foot or by horseback, random stages will pop up across each of the many provinces of China. These lead into much smaller bite sized missions and can be nigh infinitely repeated with some maybe lasting 20-30 seconds to rout 100 enemy soldiers. Proving oneself to a province enough times to win their favor usually gives the player a handy upgrade, whether it’s a more potent consumable or a faster steed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Progression in Dynasty Warriors Origins is a bit of a strange mish-mash of systems intended to see Ziluan slowly grow into a true musou warrior. Rather than earning your standard experience points and leveling up in the traditional fashion, levels are directly tied into a combined weapon proficiency across all weapon types. By securing enough kills with a particular weapon type (others also gain proficiency points, albeit at a slower pace), Ziluan will gain a level that comes with a statistical HP/ATK/DEF bump and one point on his rank which unlocks new skill panels to invest precious skill points once a certain threshold is reached. Ziluan earns one skill point for every hundred enemies slain, so blitzing through one of the repeatable missions and only racking up fifty or sixty kills won’t actually yield him anything.</span></p>
<p><span>Because of these two systems operating in tandem to make the player character more powerful, sometimes it’s beneficial to constantly rotate between weapon types and do a few missions with each. In proper musou fashion, enemy officers may randomly drop weapons but can also be purchased from the shop. It isn’t until after wrapping up the 25-30 hour narrative for a single faction that the weapon shop expands their services to transfer the randomly generated skills from one weapon to another, while another option permits fusing weapons of the same type together for permanent stat upgrades on that particular weapon. Maximizing one’s weapon is crucial for the postgame and extreme difficulty options, although players can just as easily finish the main narrative relying on enemy drops or the odd weapon purchase from the town weapon shop.</span></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins does away with some storied traditions but establishes the tried-and-true mass combat with an almost cinematic level of attention to detail. Not only is this the most fun I've had with a Dynasty Warriors title in years but the overarching story woven into the origins of the Three Kingdoms is already one of the more interesting tales of 2025 thus far. Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have shown that there's still room for innovation in the series and while the overall experience has been scaled back compared to earlier Dynasty Warriors entries, Dynasty Warriors Origins excels at every level.</p>

					<h2>Dynasty Warriors Origins</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins provides a compact narrative from the Yellow Turban Rebellion up through the Battle of Chibi and the formation of the Three Kingdoms. While the amnesiac protagonist is about as interesting as a brick, his prowess to change the tide of battle is a true force to be reckoned with.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>A tightly paced narrative that builds towards the establishment of the Three Kingdoms
</li><li>Restarting the battle from key checkpoints instead of from the beginning
</li><li>Enemy officer duels are back
</li><li>Overworld map with bite-sized missions between the grandiose 15+ minute major battles
</li><li>Game opens up with new systems after completing one story arc and working towards the true ending
</li><li>Secret unlockable weapon is just as impressive and deadly as ever
</li><li>120FPS support on PlayStation 5 Pro</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>New protagonist is bland and mostly just goes along with the flow
</li><li>Defeating an enemy officer can be a slow to break their fortitude and deal damage when enemy morale is high
</li><li>Greatly reduced number of weapon types (half of the weapons are spears while throwing knives/large maces can be used by enemy officers but not Ziluan)
</li><li>Not even a complete narrative overhaul can prevent repetition from setting in 30-50 hours into the branching story</li>						</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-published-lost-soul-aside-wont-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-it-seems.1080744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games appear to have quietly removed the requirement for PC players of upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>to have a PSN account in order to play.</p>

<p>According to the game's Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3378960/history/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update history</a> (thanks, <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/psn-account-no-longer-needed-for-lost-soul-aside-on-steam/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twisted Voxel</a>), the PSN requirement was removed back in December, but Sony didn't announce the removal of said requirement at that point.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>isn't out yet, it's technically possible that the requirement was removed for some arcane administrative reason, and that Sony still fully intends to require PC players to sign up with a PSN account in order to play the game on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=UHtB-OHH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=ghWu7udA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>may be one of the only PlayStation-published PC games not to require a PSN account to play.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if the PSN account requirement truly has been removed, then that would indicate it won't be necessary to sign up for a PSN account in order to play&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>when it eventually comes out on PC.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, PSN accounts are required to play multiplayer Sony-published games on PC; games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>require one, if only for their multiplayer modes, while titles like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Returnal&nbsp;</em>don't need you to have a PSN account to play on Steam.</p>

<p>This isn't always the case, though. According to its <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2531310/info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>, the upcoming PC port of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>will require players to sign up for PSN, even though it's a single-player game with no multiplayer component.</p>

<p>The PSN requirement for PC games is an issue for which Sony has gotten into trouble in the past. When Sony announced it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link" rel="nofollow">would begin imposing a PSN account requirement</a> on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players, the backlash was so great that the company was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">forced to walk its decision back</a>.</p>

It's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> when it does.

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;1000xRESIST</h2>



<p>Developer: Sunset Visitor | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Sunset Visitor's narrative game tells a potent tale, one that blends multiple themes with messy three-dimensional characters. The tale of Watcher and her glimpse into the life of her sovereign The All Mother is a nuanced spotlight on the effects of traumas small and large cascading into society. It is a meditative experience about what we do with our emotional baggage and how it can lead to the most horrible acts and the most noble of sacrifices.</p>

<p>For a debut title by a new studio, it is a narrative with measured confidence. One that expresses itself with passion, one that is spellbinding to experience start to finish</p>

<h2>Second Place - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>You can create a game with a charming lead man with a fedora and a bullwhip that solves ancient puzzles, but it won't truly become<em> Indiana Jones</em> if the writing doesn't match the feel. A perfect mix of knowledgeable investigation into ancient cultures, sinister enemies monologuing, and quippy banter (but not too much of the last part.)</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> finds that mix introducing the players to a mystery and continuing to expand upon it, to new memorable characters that feel fully fleshed out in the world and giving us an Indiana Jones to embody that nails the original aesthetic to fulfil the nostalgia. All while offering new fans to the genre a faithful take to continue to explore the greater franchise (except <em>Crystal Skull</em>… you can ignore that one)</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>For everyone who cries out against politics in their video games, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> defiantly asks, "What if everything in the game was political?" It has the subtlety of a nuclear bomb, with metaphors veiled so thinly you could barely see the shrink wrap. Nonetheless, it's a poignant, meaningful story, especially amid the reality we've all (sort of) shared these past few years.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> goes beyond simply saying, "This thing is unequivocally bad." There's nuance in its messaging, providing the player a launchpad to critically think for themself. For example, racism socioeconomically harms people, so we should see everyone as equals. But if you go too far, do we lose what makes each person and their culture special?</p>

<p>Louis and Sanctism aren't quite 1-to-1 caricatures of real-life figures, but there are enough parallels that the line between fantasy and reality can blur a bit. Is strongman leadership all it's cracked up to be? Is a church state really about religion, or power?</p>

<p>That blurring of reality and fantasy seems to be Studio Zero's goal, as portrayed by the (slightly convoluted) fantasy book within the game. The protagonist and his party often refer to a book about a skyscraper-laden utopia, both idealizing and questioning it. It's a direct commentary on what the player can and should do with the game itself.</p>

<p>Much like the <em>Persona </em>games before it, it's easy to come away with the overall message painting humanity in a bad light. But in reality, it's about finding the internal will and hope to fight for a better tomorrow for yourself and the ones around you.</p>
</div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>, while it's no longer possible to simply use a mod manager to place&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin mods into the game's directories and expect them to work when booting up a match, a new workaround may still allow you to use your favorite mods.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a catch. Modding steadfastly remains a violation of NetEase's terms and conditions when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so you could get banned if you're discovered using them, but that's always been the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-ban-workaround-fight.jpg?itok=6DgmZkYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-ban-workaround-fight.jpg?itok=NJDiwzx1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to mod&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;despite the recent clampdown? You still can, but there's a big catch.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't want to get too technical here, but essentially, the new workaround involves gaining direct access to a certain kind of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>file with the .pak extension.</p>

<p>As Dexerto points out, there's also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another way</a> to circumvent&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' mod ban, but this one's creator has admitted it's a "temporary fix" and that unless you've got a specific hardware setup, you could damage your storage drive if you use it for character model modding.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clamped down</a> on&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>modding with the advent of Season 1 last week, introducing a new authenticity check for character skins that essentially invalidates most existing mods.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin modding scene was (and, to a certain extent, remains) quite active prior to this clampdown, with users creating mods that turned characters into the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vegeta</a>,&nbsp;<em>GTA: San Andreas</em>' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/63" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CJ</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Smoke</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/80" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pochita</a>.</p>

<p>New information claims that Bungie’s upcoming MOBA, Gummy Bears, is inspired by Smash Bros and is being developed by a new PlayStation Studio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, sources close to the project have revealed that Bungie’s Gummy Bears will introduce several elements from Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. franchise while being a “MOBA at its core.” Aspects such as a “percentage-based damaged system,” players being knocked off the map, and more will seemingly be incorporated into the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Bungie’s Gummy Bears has been in development for three years and aims to target a younger audience by incorporating “vibrant and colourful visuals.” The title is called the “most fun” project from incubation, and multiple game modes are in the works. The title will also feature a class system with roles such as Support, Attack, and Defence. There will also be a social aspect to the game, where players can interact with each other between matches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last we heard about Bungie’s Gummy Bears MOBA was in 2023 when it was revealed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-new-game-to-use-unreal-engine-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PvP title was being developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>. Since then, the project has been handed over to a new PlayStation Studio, where 40 Bungie devs have joined the team to carry out the development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a former executive claimed that Bungie hired fans <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as they would work for less money</a>. Also, the former Marathon Director has sued Bungie and Sony <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over alleged inappropriate contact</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-sony-patent-could-use-ai-and-a-camera-pointed-at-your-fingers-to-work-out-what-button-youll-press-next<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new patent filed by Sony has detailed how the company may plan to cut down on latency in future hardware by using an AI model aided by additional sensors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony introduced its first official upscaler, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), with the PlayStation 5 Pro. While the upscaler can upscale smaller resolutions to 4K, newer graphics technology such as frame generation can come at the cost of additional latency. This means that while you are getting additional frames, your games may not feel quite as responsive as a result. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">GPU manufacturers AMD and Nvidia have sought to resolve this through Radeon Anti-Lag and Nvidia Reflex respectively, and now it appears Sony may develop a solution of its own.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/13/sony-patent-with-camera-sensor-example-1736771044695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This new Sony patent could be a game-changer for PlayStation. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">First spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-latency-predicting-inputs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech4gamers</a>, the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025010132" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony patent WO2025010132</a>, titled “TIMED INPUT/ACTION RELEASE,” is designed to tackle and streamline the “timed release of user commands” via predicting what button you’re going to press next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s rationale for the filing reads: “there can be latency between the user's input action and the system's subsequent processing and execution of the command. This in turn results in delayed execution of the command and unintended consequences in the game itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The solution is described as having several parts running in conjunction: a machine-learning AI model designed to predict what input you are going to receive next, and an external sensor, with the example of a camera pointed at your controller to determine which input you are getting ready to press. “In one particular example, the method may include providing camera input as an input to a machine learning (ML) model,” the patent reads. “The camera input may indicate the first user command.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another potential use includes the sensor being a controller button itself. Considering that Sony has been a champion for analog buttons in the past, the company may use them in a next-generation controller.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the technology as described in the patent might not make its way exactly as described in the PlayStation 6 (filings like these hardly ever do), it clearly shows that the company is looking to adopt similar technologies to cut down on latency without games feeling less responsive, especially considering the popularity of rendering tech like FSR 3 and DLSS 3, which add additional frame latency on whatever system they run on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will most likely benefit real-world scenarios like twitch shooters, which require both high framerates and low latency. But, whether or not this patent gets used in future hardware remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
