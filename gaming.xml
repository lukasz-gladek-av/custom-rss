			<p>A Call of Duty movie adaptation is in the works thanks to a deal between Microsoft-owned Activision and Paramount (which recently merged with Skydance in an $8 billion deal). <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Variety</a>, while the first order of business will be to make this film, the agreement includes the potential creation of a 'Call of Duty universe' across film and television series.</p>



<p>Paramount Chairman and CEO David Ellison said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty, this is truly a dream come true. From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly. We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand – thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation.</em></p>



<p>Rob Kostich, President of Activision, added: </p>



<p><em>Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering. With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise</em>.</p>



<p>It could be rightly said that Hollywood took far longer than expected to catch up with the entertainment behemoth that is Call of Duty, which has been dominating gaming charts for nearly twenty years, especially in the United States. To be fair, a decade ago, The Hollywood Reporter revealed the foundation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a production studio that was supposed to work on a live action cinematic universe based on the IP. They had even identified a director, Italian filmmaker Stefano Sollima, who directed 2018's Sicario: Day of the Soldado. However, this project eventually got put on hold, and Activision Blizzard Studios was shut down in 2021.</p>



<p>This time around, Activision has decided to outsource the production, clearly looking to cash in on the successful recent streak of gaming adaptations across cinema and TV (Uncharted, The Last of Us, Fallout, Sonic, Super Mario Bros.).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> campaign already features a few renowned actors, such as Milo Ventimiglia, Michael Rooker, Kiernan Shipka, and Frankie Adams. It is way too early to talk about the cast for the adaptation, though. </p>

            <p>
A group of fangame developers have taken it upon themselves to make a new Sonic Rush game for PC, combining the previous Sonic Rush games for Nintendo DS into one "definitive" remastering, with extra stuff and some apparently overdue fixes. Seems bold! I missed the Rush games back in the noughties, but I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-can-a-34-year-old-sonic-level-teach-us-about-videogame-light">do like me a Sonic</a>. Here's a trailer for Sonic Rush Rerun.

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5mGwM-uikw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
"The idea behind this remaster is to take the greatest strengths of the Sonic Rush trilogy, crank them up to 11, and combine them together to bring this game formula to its PEAK," explain the developers in the blurb. "We want to make a definitive version of Sonic Rush for PC with additional content and to fix the problems with the original game." I assume they're calling it a "trilogy" in light of the general conviction that Sonic Colors is an unofficial third Rush game.
</p>
<p>
I like the energy here, but I fear I must break off this report to deliver an agonising Old Man appraisal of something that has been bugging me for years. PSA game developers: the "up to 11" line is not supposed to be repeated sincerely. It comes from 1984 rock band mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE">there's a scene</a> where lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel shows off his custom amp, which has a volume setting with 11 levels, but isn't actually any louder than an amp with 10 levels. 
</p><p>
It's supposed to be a joke about meaningless exaggeration. But because humans are forgetful, perishable sacks of meat, and perhaps because videogame-adjacent humans especially tend to venerate numbers like gods, I keep hearing the phrase "turn it up to 11" uttered <em>with what sounds like full seriousness</em>.
</p>
<p>
I don't know if there's some kind of central marketing authority I can appeal to, here, but please can you all knock it off, because whenever I read these words in press releases, I feel like I am taking crazy pills. If nothing else, game developers, the nature of the joke means that you don't have to stop at 11. You can turn it up to 12! You can turn it up to 13, even! First one to turn it up to 13 in a press release gets their game an automatic 13/10. Or would do, if we had a scoring system. See, I always give myself an out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to Sonic Rush Rerun. The project lead is MelohRush, who got into fan animations because he played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a> and thought it needed "an extra punch of style". These youngsters! So impetuous. According to <a href="https://melohrush.carrd.co/">his portfolio</a>, he's worked on *grits teeth* 11 Sonic projects to date. 
</p>
<p>
He's joined by lead programmer Crimznraze, lead modeller Ozark and a small village of modellers, programmers, level designers, animators, sprite artists, composers, sound designers, voice actors, writers and graphic designers. It's a tidy production. You can find some music for the game's soundtrack on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SonicRushRerun">the Youtube page</a>.
</p><p>
Sonic Rush Rerun has no release date. Thanks to Jeremy for spotting it and lobbing it into the friendly sausage machine that is our news Slack. As ever with fangames, its eventual launch rests on Sega's willingness not to sue the pants off the creators for breach of copyright. Sega have proven pretty relaxed on this front, as large corporations go, and have reaped the fruits in the form of a lively community of Sonicmakers, busily engineering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/many-are-the-nostalgic-2d-sonic-fangames-but-sonic-galactic-might-be-the-best">forms of hedgehog-based entertainment</a> poor Yuji Naka never dreamed of in 1991. Some have gone onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">work for the Blue Blur directly</a>.

              <p>How can it possibly have taken 22 years for a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> movie to go into production? That’s how long it’s been since the very first WW2-themed FPS game in the franchise was released, and yet at no point over its many incarnations and decades has it come to movie theaters. That is about to change, as Paramount has agreed to a deal with Activision to convert the enormously popular shooty-bang games to the big screen.</p> <p>Whether the <em>Call of Duty</em> film will be directly adapted from any particular game or series is as of yet unclear, and given the series has at various points been a somber Second World War simulation, a ludicrous blockbuster futuristic war-wank fantasy, a zombie FPS, and now, more than anything else, a massive multiplayer shooter, that leaves a lot of room. You might imagine if the movie were due out soon, it’d make sense to focus on the <em>Black Ops</em> vein, given that’s the theme of both this and last year’s entries. But since it’s only just being announced as a deal, a million miles away from having a script or appointing a director, it’s possible everyone will be long over that angle by the time anything is released. Going back to the series’ roots also seems an unlikely choice, given WW2 cinema is a very well-trodden path with some legendary films against which it would be compared.</p> <p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a press release that the deal is a “dream come true.” He added, “From the first Allied campaigns in the original <em>Call of Duty</em>, through&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em> and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops</em>, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”</p>

 <p>Citing&nbsp;<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, presumably in an effort to show the studio has the right sort of form, Ellison said, “We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence…ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand–thrilling longtime fans of <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;while captivating a whole new generation.”</p> <p>There were no clues about the specific approach the creative team would be taking to adapting the franchise in Activision’s grimly banal press blurb either. Activision president Rob Kostich waffled about “the incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world,” and called Paramount “a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment.” Bleurgh.</p>

 <p>I’m fascinated to learn how a deal is only happening now, given&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>‘s dominance over gaming for so many years, and the games that&nbsp;<em>have</em> had cinematic conversions. It would seem like a no-brainer to slap the words “<em>Call of Duty</em>” and a colon onto pretty much any war movie and rake it in, given the games long ago abandoned anything about their storytelling that is distinctive or worthwhile. A bunch of men gruffly shouting how cross they are and then running through a crumbling building doesn’t seem like a big stretch for Hollywood.</p> <p>A movie is likely at least three or four years away in the best circumstances, so don’t go trying to book tickets just yet. It seems vastly more likely that it’ll take a lot longer, as the budget will inevitably be enormous, so too many executive eyes will be on the script, then interfering with development, then driving a director off the lot in frustration…</p>

<figure><a title="Capcom vs. SNK 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3dc2fcd885db/capcom-vs-snk-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been well over two decades since the initial launch of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a>, and although the game is now playable on Switch via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>, fans are undoubtedly desperate to see a brand-new entry.</p>
<p>Someone else who would like to see 'Capcom vs. SNK 3' is none other than Hideaki Itsuno, who served as the director for the second entry. If that's not enough, he also said that he wants to be the one who makes it.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-veteran-itsuno-says-he-wants-to-make-capcom-vs-snk-3-even-though-he-now-works-for-neither/">VGC</a>, Itsuno lamented that he is no longer involved with either Capcom or SNK, but stated that if the companies were to license the game out to him, then he'd love to make Capcom vs. SNK 3. More than anything, however, he is simply keen to make a fresh fighting game; so much so that it's "at the top of my list'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bPF0AVvJULs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed590388ztljio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPF0AVvJULs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>“I do want to make a fighting game like Capcom vs SNK, but now I’m neither Capcom nor SNK. If they license it to me, though, I want to make Capcom vs SNK 3. I want to make a fighting game, and it’s at the top of my list of games I want to make.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Itsuno is currently hard at work making a new IP within the action genre; likely similar to the likes of <strong>Devil May Cry</strong> and <strong>Bayonetta</strong>, the former of which flourished under his direction at Capcom. He left the company in 2024 to form Lightspeed Japan Studio, a subsidiary of the Tencent Games-owned Lightspeed Studios.</p>
<p>As for Capcom and SNK, the two have shared multiple collaborations and crossovers over the years, perhaps most notably in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which saw the release of Terry and Mai as playable characters, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fatal_fury_city_of_the_wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, which recently welcomed Ken into its roster.</p>

        <p>I'd tell you how common they are, but I'm one of the folks still waiting for the update to install</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Terminid spelunking update, dubbed Into the Unjust, has dropped from orbit today, September 2nd. Sadly, that hellpod's impact with the game's surface looks to have triggered an uptick in crash reports, and Arrowhead are now busy "working to isolate fixes".</p>
<p>If you missed the update's announcement the other day, Edwin was strapped into the news driver's seat at the time, and has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-very-soon-helldivers-2s-giant-terminid-caving-update-is-a-feast-of-nods-to-aliens-and-dune-plus-dragons">nice rundown of what's in it here</a>. He even consulted some very real geographers, the absolute pro. The short version? Terminid cave missions on Hive Worlds to aid Super Earth's efforts to fight an evil cloud, and some new enemies flying around.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Sadly, as Arrowhead have been admirably transparent about in the past, new additions to Helldivers 2 tend to bring with them a helping of new issues that need shooting into submission. Into the Unjust's been no different, with a wave of fresh crash reports leading community manager Katherine Baskin to let players know via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102974129734434919/1412450267361706018">Discord</a> that the devs are on the case.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the issues with crashing, which are NOT in accordance with Super Earth Standards and we are working to isolate fixes now. We apologize for this delay and will report back with updates soon," she wrote. Phew, now the many folks writing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/search/?q=crash&amp;type=posts&amp;t=hour&amp;cId=fb662426-0a5e-4086-836f-d0ebaa1542be&amp;iId=a6e9c0ab-df8d-4b22-9fab-ab9d8c622382">their own individual Reddit posts</a> about encountering crashes can chill out a bit.
</p><p>Speaking of the Helldivers 2 subreddit, in my trip there to check just how widespread the crash chatter was, I ran into a number of folks also registering their unhappiness at quite how beefy the game's file size is getting on PC. As someone who's had the update installing onto my games box since late this morning, and as of yet hasn't had it finish patching all of its files, that really hit me where I live.</p>
<p>It'd be unwise to assume that the file size is the only factor contributing to Helldivers 2 taking a while to update - I'm usually the first to go the other way and assume the problem must be on my end - but given <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6f0sf/todays_update_has_now_put_the_pc_build_size_at/">a thread on the subject</a>'s amassed 9.1k upvotes and just under 800 comments in about six hours, landing near the top of the subreddit, it's maybe worth Arrowhead looking into. That said, in my case there's also the fact I've been using my PC to do my job while Into the Unjust's been downloading, and that may well have had an impact.</p>
<p>Regardless, I've got some bug spelunking planned for tonight, so you may well hear about my travails if anything noteworthy or wacky happens.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s Tuesday, but it feels like Monday thanks to Labor Day giving many of us the day off. But that weird feeling and a short week won’t stop the Morning Checkpoint. Today, we learn more about Ubisoft’s potential plans for <em>Rayman</em>, catch up on <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025 news</a>, and see how a group of modders is reviving <em>The Crew</em> after Ubisoft killed its servers last year. Also, another game gets delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>. And good news: The next Benoit Blanc murder mystery movie hits theaters this Thanksgiving.</p> <h2><em>The Crew Unlimited</em> brings the racing game back online</h2> <p>In April 2024, Ubisoft shut down the servers powering its 10-year-old open-world racing game<em> The Crew</em>. This made it unplayable, and that didn’t go over well with fans. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-killing-games-the-crew-lawsuit-shutdown-offline-1851695302">the shutdown led to legal battles and a whole “Stop Killing Games” movement</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">as reported by <em>RPS</em></a>, the game that started all of it has been revived, but not by Ubisoft.</p> <p>Instead, <em>The Crew Unlimited,</em> a free mod for the PC version of the racing game, is being built and supported by a group of modders. The mod, which has been in development for about a year now, is set to arrive on September 15. The core of the mod is a server emulator that will let players essentially trick the game into thinking the official Ubisoft servers are still operating like it’s 2014. You can even, with some work, run the server emulator on your own PC, effectively giving players the offline mode they’ve begged Ubisoft for over the last decade. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034">And something which Ubisoft is adding to<em> The Crew 2</em> and its sequel.)</a></p>

 <p>While the mod looks like it won’t be the easiest thing to set up, videos of it in action look great, with the devs even making some minor fixes and tweaks to <em>The Crew</em> based on fan feedback. If publishers won’t help preserve video games, fans will do it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">It’s been like this for decades, and I doubt anything will change soon</a>.</p> <h2>Another game has been delayed because of <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><em>Silksong’s</em> surprise September 4 launch and $20 price tag have caused many other indie games to panic and flee the days around the game’s release date. And we can add another game to the list:<em> Star Birds</em>. This is the next game from the <em>Dofromantik</em> developers and it’s a colorful strategy management game based on a popular educational YouTube channel. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2719750/view/538863491448046148?l=english"><em>Star Birds</em> was set to arrive on September 4, but will now launch six days later on September 10</a>.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft reportedly wants to make a <em>Rayman 4</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">👊 🎉Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy 🎂🥳</p> <p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p> <p>— Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/">A new report from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> claims that the previously reported <em>Rayman</em> remake is progressing nicely, and the plan is to launch the game in 2026. <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694">In a new video</a> from Ubisoft celebrating the 30th anniversary of the platforming series, Ubisoft confirmed that it was working on a new <em>Rayman</em> game but warned that more news wouldn’t come anytime soon.<em> Insider Gaming</em> reports that the remake is the new game and that if it sells well enough, Ubisoft will develop a <em>Rayman</em> <em>4</em>. Reportedly, there are already “preliminary plans” in place for that sequel.</p> <h2>Capcom president blames PS5’s high price for soft numbers</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcoms-president-says-high-price-of-ps5-has-contributed-to-low-sales-of-monster-hunter-wilds">As spotted by <em>GamesIndustry.biz,</em></a> in a recent interview, Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto partially blamed the “soft” sales of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on the high cost of the PlayStation 5. While <em>MonHun Wilds</em> sold incredibly well out of the gate, becoming the fastest-selling Capcom game in the company’s history, the publisher’s most recent financial results called the game’s sales in Q1 2025 “soft.” According to Tsujimoto, you can blame that on the high price of a PS5 in most parts of the world.</p> <p>“The console costs about ¥80,000 ($538). When you factor in the cost of software and monthly subscriptions, it comes to about ¥100,000 ($672) at the time of purchase. This is not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations. This situation is not limited to Japan, but is similar overseas as well,” said Tsujimoto.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">Our report on the <em>Borderlands 4</em> rage room at PAX West 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695">Hands-on impressions of <em>Silksong</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s</em> intro is still amazing on Switch 2</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fairgame$ - CGI Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games</p>
      </div>
<p>Drapeau left Haven weeks ago, and said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a> that they're joining WB Games Montreal as a creative director for an upcoming project. "Let's do this!" Drapeau said.</p><p>Drapeau is a video game industry veteran, having started back in 2006 in testing and internship positions with VMC and Odd1 before joining Ubisoft in 2007 as a game designer. Drapeau was later promoted to lead game designer on Rainbow Six Siege before leaving to join Eidos-Montreal in 2017 to work on Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Drapeau re-joined Ubisoft in 2019 and worked at the company for two years before moving to Haven in 2021.</p><p>There is no word yet on what Drapeau is working on at WB Games Montreal, but the studio was said to have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones game earlier this year.</a> The studio assisted Rocksteady with 2024's underperforming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and also made 2022's Gotham Knights.</p><p>As for Haven and Fairgame$, the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583">now reportedly coming in Spring 2026</a>, putting it in the vicinity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> in May 2026.</p><h2><strong>What is Fairgame$ all about?</strong></h2><p>As you can see in the announcement trailer, Fairgame$ has players going after billionaires who have "too much money and too much power." In the trailer, we see a squad of players infiltrating some kind of compound, working together to take down security guards with the apparent aim of sticking it to the man.</p><p>"Fairgame$ will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot," creative director Mathieu Leduc said. "Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires."</p><h2>Trouble with Sony's live-service push</h2><p>Back when Fairgame$ was announced in 2023, Sony was in the midst of a huge push and investment into the live-service market. At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a> It recently came to Xbox, and, along with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">new update</a>, has seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">huge surge in popularity.</a></p><p>In August 2024, Sony launched the multiplayer game Concord. It had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed. At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.</a></p><p dir="ltr">It was reported in 2023 that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who left Sony in 2024, had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandate that Sony's teams should make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were reportedly upset with this, and the blame was said to have fallen not on Ryan but Connie Booth, one of the most important and veteran PlayStation developers, leading to her eventual departure.</p><p dir="ltr">Another former PlayStation boss, Shuhei Yoshida, recently said the chance of finding success in the competitive live-service market was "small," but his replacement, Hermen Hulst, was given the resources to fund both single-player games and live-service titles at the same time. However, had Yoshida stayed in that role, he said he would have <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/" rel="nofollow ">"tried to resist"</a> the push into the live-service market. He joked, "That's one of the reasons they removed me."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Fairgame$, Sony is working on multiple other live-service games, including Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>--which is facing its own set of challenges and has been delayed indefinitely. Another game, codenamed Gummy Bears, which spun out from Bungie at SIE, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/report-playstation-gummy-bears-moba-live-service-pre-alpha-teamlfg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently crossed a milestone.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Following the failure of Concord, top boss Hermen Hulst said Sony put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">new structures in place to help ensure its live-service games come to market in better shape. </a></p><p dir="ltr">For more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/" data-ref-id="2900-6143">Sony's live-service games</a>, check out the gallery below to get the latest on the status of all the projects in the works.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In July the United Kingdom's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Online Safety Act</a> came into effect, requiring that any form of online services feature age verification checks if these services contain content that could be deemed "harmful to children." This law has affected a range of websites, including social media sites like X, as well as sites that contain adult, 18+ content, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-require-age-verification-beginning-in-2026-for-the-uk/1100-6533499/">even Xbox will require age verification in the UK come next year</a>. Now, Valve has introduced its own age verification process that requires users in the UK to register a credit card to their account in order to view certain games.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed on a new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6" rel="nofollow">Steam support page</a> titled Age Assurance Under the UK Online Safety Act, Valve explains, "In order to access Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs, you need to be logged into an active user account and explicitly opt-in through the account settings page. For UK users, this opt-in process requires age verification. Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account."</p><p dir="ltr">Valve says that it uses this process as Ofcom, the UK's regulatory and competition authority, has said that credit card checks are very effective forms of age verification due to the fact you must be 18 to obtain one. GameSpot can also confirm that a UK debit card will not work in place of a credit card--in the UK children as young as 11 can get a debit card, which is likely why this is not offered as an option.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the Steam support page doesn't specify what constintutes a "mature" game--GameSpot can also confirm that games with violent and occasionally sexual content like Baldur's Gate 3 and Kingdom Come Deliverence 2 are still viewable, as well as controversial titles like Postal 2. Games where sexual content is a main feature appears to differ from title to title.</p><p dir="ltr">Steam isn't the only digital game storefront that has put restrictions in place regarding the Online Safety Act. <a href="https://itch.io/t/5133739/our-update-on-the-uk-online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Itch.io has made it so that affected pages will be entirely unavailable in the UK</a> until it implements a third-party age verification process.</p>

			<p>Today, Techland has confirmed the final PC system requirements for Dying Light: The Beast. The new entry in the popular first-person open world action zombie game was originally scheduled to launch on August 22, but the Polish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a slight delay to September 19 in order to apply more refinements and tweaks.</p>



<p>The requirements are quite a bit higher than those of Techland's previous game, 2022's Dying Light 2: Stay Human, indirectly confirming the upgrade of the underlying Chrome Engine that the developers have been touting.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>MINIMUM</strong></td><td><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></td><td><strong>HIGH</strong></td><td><strong>ULTRA</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PERFORMANCE</strong></td><td>1080p 30FPS</td><td>1440p 60FPS</td><td>4K 60FPS</td><td>4K 60FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GRAPHIC SETTINGS</strong></td><td>LOW</td><td>MEDIUM</td><td>HIGH</td><td>ULTRA (RT W/ FRAME GENERATION)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT - Intel Arc A750</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TI - AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT - Intel Arc B580</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TI - AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 AMD -  Radeon RX 9070 -  Intel Arc B580</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU MEMORY</strong></td><td>6GB</td><td>8GB</td><td>12GB</td><td>12GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel i5-13400F -AMD Ryzen 7 5800F</td><td>Intel i5-13400F - AMD Ryzen 7 7700</td><td>Intel i7-13700K -AMD Ryzen 9 7800 X3D</td><td>Intel i9-14900K - AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>16GB</td><td>16GB</td><td>32GB</td><td>32GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>STORAGE</strong></td><td>70 GB SSD</td><td>70 GB SSD</td><td>70 GB SSD</td><td>70 GB SSD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>When it comes to features, the game will support all the latest upscalers from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel, and other features, such as NVIDIA Reflex 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raytraced Global Illumination and Reflections</li>



<li>Ultra-wide resolution support</li>



<li>Upscaler and Frame Generation: Intel XeSS 2, NVIDIA DLSS 4, and AMD FSR 3.1 &amp; 4 (on select devices)</li>



<li>Latency Optimization: NVIDIA Reflex 2, AMD AntiLag 2, and Intel Xe Low Latency</li>



<li>In-depth customization options</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, Techland has released separate Dying Light: The Beast specs for PC laptops.</p>

I guess the simplest way to describe Jitter is that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a>, the hectic spaceship hijacking game from Suspicious Developments, but you are the spaceship, not the hijacker, and also, you can glue pieces of other ships onto yourself, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/captain-forever">Captain Forever</a>, and also, this looks a bit like Lemmings on the Game Boy. Boil that down, and we have a brand new subgenre, the Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike, which... let's maybe forget I wrote the words "Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike". Let's proceed without further reflection to this video showcasing the combat.

<p>
If the above description confuses and alarms you, there's a cleaner one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877660/Jitter/">the game's Steam page</a>. "Jitter is an immersive sci-fi exploration and survival game set on a mining colony and its outskirts in the Main Asteroid Belt," it reads. "You assume the role of an experimental AI that maintains ship functions and engages with the crew on board. As you explore the mining colony, you will take on new missions, expand ships and bases using various modules, add survivors to your crew, engage in space fights, and repair the damage left by enemy fire and onboard accidents."
</p>
<p>
Cue impressive scenes of your greenish top-down AI core chewing through asteroids like a lemming through a baguette. Shoo, lemming! That's my lunch, not an asteroid, and since when do lemmings eat asteroids, anyway. 
</p>
<p>
No time for lunch, though, because it's time to talk about simulation systems. As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a>, you'll organise the generation and flow of power and oxygen around your craft as you expand it, ensuring that you still, for example, have the means to swiftly fix hull breaches while adding gun turrets to the design. It might sound like it requires a shedload of menus, but the largely mouse-based controls are quite simple for a game of this fiddliness. There's a demo on Steam, if you'd like to try for yourself.
</p><p>
If the idea of playing an AI seems dry, may I draw your attention to the line above about your crew. It consists of named humans with fetching character portraits and bespoke abilities. You'll shepherd them through boarding actions, opening airlocks and tactically clicking rooms to have them survive against greater numbers. Beware: if you lose one of the story-critical ones, it's game over. This seems to rule out the possibility of being an Evil AI, alas, though there's definitely scope for venting the odd humanoid in a fit of cybernetic pique. 
</p>
<p>
I've enjoyed what I've played of Jitter, though it's a bit too processing-intensive for my work laptop, with all manner of physics-enabled celestial body bouncing around the playing field. There's no release date yet, but developers Berko Games posted in June that they're now focussing on "the final major updates before our Early Access release".</p>
<p>Their practical difficulties include living in Ukraine, a country that has been fighting off a Russian invasion for three and a half years. "It's not easy working under drone and missile strikes, but your attention and support should remain focused on the game itself," the developers comment briefly in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2877660/view/541108949283242521?l=english">a recent update</a> about the game's NPC vessel behaviour.

		<p>Fall is here, which means a big moment is approaching: the end of sandal season. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm going to be wearing those things as my primary  non-running transport until there's literal snow on the ground, but I can tell its days are numbers. I've found myself putting on "normal" shoes with some regularity, while the sandals pout in the corner. "It's going to be 68 tomorrow, don't worry." Or "I can't take the kids to school in sandals, friend. Doing so when it's so chilly would be <em>scandalous</em>." The days are also numbered for the above ground pool, though stubbornly I'm using last year's surprise 80s days in September as reason to keep that chilly bad boy filled up.</p><p>-pk, who was somehow not spoiled on <em>Bananza</em>'s fun endgame reveal!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>SUBSCRIBER POD:</strong> A little tease of a three-hour travel pod for next week, which hopefully is a nice incentive to think about becoming a subscriber!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Co-Op Corner (feat: Popucom)</em> – Over time, it's become clear that Chia and I really get a kick out of playing games with one another, especially when we can fuck with each other, too. <em>Popucom</em> really struck us when we played a demo earlier this year, and I gotta admit, last week's stream kinda cemented Popucom as a dark horse game of the year contender.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount has officially acquired the rights to produce a Call of Duty movie. In an announcement on Tuesday, it was said that Paramount will create a live-action film based on the long-running franchise.</p>



<p>The news comes just days after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-seeking-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial rumors began to circulate</a>.</p>



<p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said that, as a “lifelong fan” of Call of Duty, the opportunity for his company to develop a movie on the franchise is a “dream come true”.</p>



<p><strong>“Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve.”</strong></p>



<p>Ellison added that he can “promise” that Paramount will be <strong>“resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy&nbsp;of&nbsp;this one-in-a-million brand.”</strong></p>



<p>Activision President Rob Kostic said that, with Paramount, the studio has found what he believes to be a “fantastic partner” to bring the series to the big screen.</p>



<p><strong>“The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started,”</strong> Kostic said. <strong>“Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans&nbsp;of&nbsp;the franchise.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as who’ll write, direct, and star in the film, that information won’t be revealed for some time. Even a release date is far too off to be announced at this time. </p>



<p>The deal, according to sources at <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, is for just one movie. However, there are opportunities to expand further.</p>

                <p>The next big chapter in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> saga is now live--with detailed patch notes to boot--and with the armies of Super Earth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/">being joined by new Xbox recruits</a>, it's time to explore uncharted territory. Into the Unjust will see Helldivers venture into subterranean Terminid lairs, hostile territory that cuts troopers off from their usual Super Destroyer support unless they find a gap in the structures. Just what secrets lie behind the mysterious Gloom shroud that has been seen on several Hive Worlds? You'll have to find out for yourself, but at least there's some neat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/">new armor and weapons you can equip</a> to help you in your fight.</p><p>As for the update, this will include the usual selection of gameplay tweaks, bug fixes, and new content. Hive Worlds with randomly generated cave systems will be introduced here, giving players a chance to discover "disgusting flora and fauna" amidst advanced Terminid species. These planets also feature acid lakes that you don't want to take a swim in, destructible walls in the cave systems, and dark zones where multi-legged horrors will be hiding.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Dust Devils Warbond Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the new gameplay modes will also task you with taking control of a mobile oil rig to siphon the mysterious oily substance from these worlds, and for the new enemy types, developer Arrowhead is teasing four new Terminid breeds. Rupture Spewers can vomit a lethal substance on players, Rupture Warriors hide in the dark away to protect their organs from UV radiation, and Rupture Chargers can burrow through the ground to ambush Helldivers. Finally, Dragonroaches attack from the sky with an acid bombing run.</p><p>For the tweaks and fixes, Arrowhead has resolved the issue with one of the iconic Halo weapons in the ODST Warbond. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halos-assault-rifle-is-causing-helldivers-2-to-crash/1100-6534292/">The MA5C Assault Rifle was causing the game to crash</a> if a party leader had it equipped while on the bridge of their super destroyer, but this has now been patched.

            <p>
A live-action film adaptation of Call of Duty is in the works at Paramount, having signed a deal with Activision Blizzard.
</p>
<p>
Paramount - now under media company Skydance - has announced the news (thanks <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-1236503796/">Deadline</a>), with CEO David Ellison a big fan of the series. Activision will be a creative partner on the film.
</p>
<p>
"As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true," said Ellison. "From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I've spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honour and a responsibility that we don't take lightly."

<p>
The film will follow the studio's 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick. "We're approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve," continued Ellison.
</p>
<p>
"I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honours the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand - thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation."
</p>
<p>
President of Activision Rob Kostich added: "Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering. With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honour and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple - to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is ripe for a cinematic adaptation, both for its action-packed setpieces and millions of sales.

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14c9629533367/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you somehow missed it, today is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> Eve Eve. Yes, it's a term that I've just made up, but I've been waiting for this one for the past seven years, so you'll have to forgive me for counting down the days as if I'm on the run up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Team Cherry's surprise announcement two weeks ago might have been too short notice to break out the advent calendar for the countdown to <strong>4th September</strong>, but it was plenty long enough for me to start reminiscing over the last seven years of waiting. Because, when I really thought about it, it might be one of the most hilarious-looking development timelines that any studio has managed to muster.</p>
<p>If, like me, you have been following this one for yonks, then Team Cherry's famed updates (or lack of them) will be old news, but with a mere two days to go, I thought it might be fun to take a stroll down memory lane and reminisce about the news beats in Silksong's development cycle that had us all donning our clown makeup and taking to the nearest Direct Live Chat to frantically type "SILKsONG WHEn??"</p>
<p>I've only taken the biggest developments for the following recap — let's forget about how we all lost our minds over every single license update on the Silksong Steam page — but it paints a pretty hilarious picture of how long the Silksong fever has had us on tenterhooks. We might have hung up our multicoloured wigs and put away our red noses, but gosh, we had some good times together, didn't we?</p>
<p>Let's start this quick recap with the most jam-packed year of them all...</p>
<h2>2019</h2>

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/hollow_knight_silksong_is_coming_to_nintendo_switch_as_a_console_exclusive">Hollow Knight: Silksong is officially revealed</a> - 14th February</strong></h4>
<p>Team Cherry might have given us the best Valentine's Day of 'em all back in 2019 when it officially lifted the lid on Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1095979129432813569">announcement tweet</a> has since pulled in 41 thousand likes, while the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">reveal trailer</a> has racked up 4.7 million views — hey, seven years of waiting will do that!</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/03/team_cherry_provides_hollow_knight_silksong_update_new_characters_revealed">Team Cherry showcases new Silksong characters</a> - 19th March</strong></h4>
<p>Just one month after the reveal, Team Cherry was back with another update, this time showcasing a handful of the colourful cast of characters we'll meet in the sequel.</p>
<p>We got official descriptions for Lace - "a dangerous foe, cloaked in mystery, who’ll delight at causing Hornet’s swift, skewered demise," Shakra - "a warrior seeking her master, who vanished under strange circumstances", Trobbio - "Master of the Stage, the Brush and the Voice", Sherma - "An optimistic pilgrim on a spiritual journey" and Garmond and Zaza - "A rambunctious older bug and his noble steed, on a quest to discover a new home".</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/team_cherry_shares_more_hollow_knight_silksong_details_will_launch_when_its_ready">Silksong appears at E3's Nintendo Treehouse: Live</a> - 26th June</strong></h4>
<p>Gosh, remember when the updates came this thick and fast?</p>
<p>Hot off the back of a bunch of Silksong gameplay being shown off in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8lvHT_IQbM">Nintendo Treehouse</a> presentation at E3 2019, Team Cherry shared a blog post packed with bonus Silksong details, and our first look at the Greymoor area, which the team described as "one of the biggest" they've ever created.</p>
<h2>2020</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Huntress" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24c19694b5af4/hollow-knight-silksong-huntress.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/06/team_cherry_discord_riddle_reveals_a_new_hollow_knight_silksong_character">Another Silksong character is officially revealed... via Discord</a> - 17th June</strong></h4>
<p>Team Cherry was all fun and games back in the day, and it kept the Silksong hype going throughout the dark days of 2020 by sharing riddles in the game's Discord channel.</p>
<p>This one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/h9ovt5/oh_god_not_another_one_of_these/">riddle</a> in particular gave us our first look at another NPC, Huntress - "a towering old predator, awaiting her children to come".</p>
<h2>2021</h2>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/random_edge_magazine_is_teasing_a_world_exclusive">Even more details pop up in EDGE Magazine's "World Exclusive"</a> - 2nd January</strong></h4>
<p>After a pretty quiet 2020, Team Cherry spilled the beans on a bunch of Silksong details in a "world exclusive" with EDGE Magazine.</p>
<p>This included info on Hornet's questlines, Crests and 'Tricks', but it didn't include a release date. The wait continued.</p>
<h2>2022</h2>

<h4><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/team-cherry-kind-of-shares-update-about-development-status-of-hollow-knight-silksong"><strong>Team Cherry says Silksong's release "</strong><strong>can’t be too much longer</strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/team-cherry-kind-of-shares-update-about-development-status-of-hollow-knight-silksong">"</a> - 11th May</strong></h4>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong picked up the Unity Award for Most Anticipated Game in 2022, and Team Cherry got us all excited when it announced that the game's release "can't be much longer, surely".</p>
<p>The worst part of all this? We believed it!</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/new-hollow-knight-silksong-trailer-features-in-xbox-showcase-out-in-the-next-12-months">Xbox Games Showcase reveals Silksong will release in "the next 12 months"</a> - 12th June</strong></h4>
<p>Well, this might be the biggest clown meme moment of them all.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong made a surprise appearance in the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022, with Microsoft revealing that the title will be available as a day one Game Pass release, "in the next 12 months". So that puts it as launching at some point before mid-2023, right? <em>Right</em>?</p>
<h2>2023</h2>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/hollow-knight-silksong-no-longer-releasing-in-the-first-half-of-2023">Team Cherry confirms Silksong isn't launching in the first half of 2023</a> - 10th May</strong></h4>
<p>And so we arrive at perhaps the funniest back-to-back developments in the entire timeline. As is turns out, that "next 12 months" release window from Microsoft might have been a <em>little</em> off, with Team Cherry's marketing and publishing rep, Matthew Griffin, taking to <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680">Twitter</a> to reveal that "development is still continuing".</p>
<p>Hey, at least he let us know that we could expect more details "closer to release", so that's... helpful.</p>
<h2>2024</h2>

<h2>2025</h2>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/team-cherry-reconfirms-hollow-knight-silksong-is-actually-real-in-small-development-update">Silksong "is real, progressing, and will release"</a> - 12th Jan</strong></h4>
<p>As a surefire sign that we were collectively losing our minds at this point, Griffin returned to <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696">Twitter</a> to reveal that, yes, Silksong is a real thing. What's more, he promised that it "will release". <em>That's it</em>.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/hollow-knight-silksong-will-launch-on-switch-2-in-2025">A Direct appearance, accompanied by a 2025 release window</a> - 2nd April</strong></h4>
<p>What was one of the biggest stories out of the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal Direct? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>? Our first proper look at the console we had all been champing at the bit for?</p>
<p>No, it was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it Silksong appearance in a sizzle reel accompanied by a 2025 release window. It would be coming to Switch 2 at <em>some point</em> this year. News!</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/hollow-knight-silksong-will-launch-on-switch-2-in-2025">Hollow Knight: Silksong "special announcement" finally reveals release date</a> - 21st Augu</strong>st</h4>
<p>We did it! It finally happened! A two-minute gameplay trailer and a brief graphic of mist parting on a 4th September release date was enough to make me, and everyone else in the world, it seems, jump for joy.</p>
<p>I'll remind you again, <em>it's just two days away</em>!</p>

<h4><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/team-cherry-provides-one-last-silksong-update-before-launch">Team Cherry gives one final update for Kickstarter backers</a> - 2nd September</strong></h4>
<p>Okay, one last (?) update before we all get our hands on the damn thing.</p>
<p>Team Cherry provided a final <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863">Kickstarter update</a> for all those who backed the game many moons ago, stating that Switch 2 players will have to download the free upgrade pack from the eShop at launch to "unlock the platform's enhanced features".</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And that's just about it! After seven years of being drip-fed information, Silksong is very, very nearly here. Having looked through the announcements since 2019, my hype level is currently sitting at an all-time high — just look at how far we've come! — but what about you? You can let me know whether you share my excitement in the following poll.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rayman-remake-reportedly-targeting-2026-rayman-4-also-planned.1286508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Ubisoft is currently working on a&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake, that said remake is tentatively scheduled for next year, and that a fourth mainline&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game is also in development.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>&nbsp;(who, as per, cites "those familiar with the game's development"), the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake is "tentatively targeting a late 2026 release date", and it's going "incredibly well".</p>

<p>That project is joined by&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4&nbsp;</em>(which almost certainly won't be its final name), which, according to Henderson, is currently in the preliminary planning stages. Henderson's sources apparently say that&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4</em>'s existence will depend on whether the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake does well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-legends.jpg?itok=GvjAqt3Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-legends.jpg?itok=AAqfixo0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rayman Legends&nbsp;</em>remains the most recent full platforming entry in the series.</figcaption></figure><p>Henderson's report is bolstered by the fact that, in celebration of&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>'s 30th anniversary, Ubisoft confirmed yesterday that the franchise is still active, and that teams at the developer's Montpellier and Milan studios are "currently working together" on&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>'s future.</p>

<p>Producer Loic Gounon says that fans shouldn't expect news from Ubisoft on what's in the works for&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>"too soon", but reassures those hopeful for a new&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game by saying the franchise is "in good hands".</p>

<p>Of course, Gounon's comments don't confirm Henderson's report; for all we know, the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake could be canceled at a moment's notice, especially if recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a> elsewhere in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">industry</a> are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remains in Ubisoft's thoughts. Let's just hope the studio chooses to revive him in a form marginally less offensive than his appearance in that one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-rayman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">really weird NFT game</a> from late last year.</p>

More at eleven.</figcaption></figure><p>As Gounon says, it's likely to be some time before we hear anything more about Ubisoft's plans for&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>, so you'll have to stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the series' latest mainline title,&nbsp;<em>Rayman Legends</em>, is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242550/Rayman_Legends/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-CUSA00069_00-RAYMANLEGENDS001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rayman-legends/C26K4DVGR45B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rayman-legends-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as all of those machines' successors thanks to backwards compatibility), and if you haven't played it yet, you really should.</p>

Backbone’s newest gamepad has the same phone-hugging design as its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">2020 predecessor</a>, but comes with a handful of distinct features — the most notable being that it can be paired via Bluetooth to any number of devices, not just phones. The rechargeable controller just got its first temporary price cut, going from $169.99 to $149.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fbackbone-pro-usb-c-mobile-and-wireless-controller-for-cloud-gaming-remote-play-and-mobile-games-on-any-screen-black%2FJ3R84TZYPV" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. Best Buy indicates this sale will expire at the end of the day.</p><p>The Pro features more robust grips and bigger analog sticks (they’re ALPS, not Hall effect, sadly) while retaining the original’s hallmark feature, which is that Android and iPhone models with a USB-C port can be inserted into the controller, from which you can launch into Backbone’s polished dashboard. It effectively turns your phone into a console, with the ability to snap/record clips, chat with friends through the platform, and livestream, if you wish. It also has a USB-C port for passthrough charging, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and two customizable rear paddles.</p><p>The Pro offers more versatility than the original (the Pro is a solid wireless Steam Deck controller), and can perform a cool party trick, if you have the right hardware and subscriptions. If you start an Xbox cloud game streaming session from your phone, you can resume it from a TV that supports the Xbox app, and easily switch the Pro to control it there instead via Backbone’s mobile app.</p><p>While few competitors attempt Backbone’s multipurpose pairing, some outshine the Pro when it comes to being able to fit more devices, namely iPads and other tablets. The <a href="http://amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">GameSir G8 Plus</a> is $79.99 and can fit an iPad mini or a Nintendo Switch.

These are JBL’s high-end earbuds that include a charging case with a built-in screen on the front. The screen does a decent job at replicating some features that you’d otherwise find on a smartwatch. For instance, it’ll show who’s calling, and let you either answer or reject the call. It can also alert you when you’ve received a text, although it won’t show the contents on its screen (that’s either a plus or a minus, depending on who you ask). In terms of sound quality, former <em>Verge </em>reviewer Chris Welch preferred Apple’s AirPods Pro and Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 to these, but at almost half-price, JBL’s set is worth considering. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23712032/jbl-tour-pro-2-earbuds-smart-case-review">Read our review</a></span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/768973/backbone-pro-bluetooth-gaming-controller-intel-battlefield-6-deal-sale#comments">2<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/768973/backbone-pro-bluetooth-gaming-controller-intel-battlefield-6-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <p>February 1st, 2021. Until yesterday, that was the last time Ubisoft had posted anything on the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rayman-legends">Rayman</a> Tweeter account. That outstanding streak has been broken because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platforming series</a> has turned 30, promting the publisher to reaffirm that a team of devs is still busy working on Rayman's future, with news to come, er, not very soon.</p>
<p>Before you shout at me for writing about a games company posting that, yes, they still plan to make video games in the future, this is also a chance to highlight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGyqe1t_JU&amp;t=2s">Rayman Alive 2025</a>, a pretty hefty community showcase of fan projects helping to keep the aged limbless being's legacy alive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an appearance at the end of that fan-run event, Rayman producer Loic Gounon and composer Christophe Heral did all the thanking you'd expect, while also providing that brief update on Raymond Man's status. "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman," Gounon reaffirmed. "Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>Heral then whipped out a rather delightful banjo and delivered some sweet tuneage while Rayman stood on a plant leaf next to him, blankly staring into the void. Ubisoft added that the likes of exclusive concept art and behind-the-scenes dev interviews will be put out in the coming months.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>👊 🎉Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy 🎂🥳</p><p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p></div>— Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Anyway, this served as the climax of Rayman Alive 2025, which is organised by <a href="https://x.com/VnheardVoices">Vnheard</a>, creator of unofficial Raymanimated series <a href="https://x.com/Rayman_SL">Rayman: Scepter of Leptys</a>. There were cameos from a whole host of Rayfan projects throught the showcase, including Rayman: Origins mod <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/617018">Ales Origins</a>, fan comic <a href="https://x.com/clairiphi/status/1962604349277843650">Rayman Nightmarish</a>, and <a href="https://raymanbeatbox.tonocatmeow.com/">Rayman Legends Beatbox</a>, the latter of which you can fire up in your browser and have Rayman shred some fat bass guitar riffs as you work.</p>
<p>There's a full list of featured projects in the description, and as ever with these sorts of community showcases, there's a chance you'll find something you dig in there. Hey, given how long it might be until Ubisoft do a Rayman tweet again, the Rayfans'll need it.</p>

              <p>Los Angeles’ Anime Expo 2025 describes itself as North America’s “largest celebration of Japanese pop culture.” The 34th such event finished recently, with the four-day spectacular seeing an extraordinary 410,000 people show up, and it even played host to a Sukeban (the Japanse female pro-wrestling league) World Championship Fight. Also, of course, it featured squillions of attendees showing up in some superbly good cosplay. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em> heroes Minerablu were there to capture the very best fits.</p> <p>Given the anime focus, costumes obviously skewed that way, but gaming still got a look-in. Look, it’s not like it’s possible to stop at least&nbsp;<em>one Elden Ring</em> outfit getting into the gallery. (The really shocking thing is that there’s not a single person sporting an outfit from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> in this latest collection!) That does mean we get some superbly original stuff, including the most stunning Derpy from&nbsp;<em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>. I imagine the next few cosplay galleries we post are going to contain a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more characters from that movie as the sewing catches up.</p> <p>So click on for the finest fits from Anime Expo 2025. And check back soon to see a video of the event, too.</p>
