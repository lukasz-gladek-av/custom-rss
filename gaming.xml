<p>The Season One Battle Pass for Black Ops 6 is sure to be a momentous occasion, bringing with it a ton of exciting Operator Skins, Emblems, Calling Cards, and new Weapons. We’re here to take a look at the latest details on the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass and its potential release date.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is continuing on with the successful live-service, seasonal model of its predecessors. Battle Passes aren’t going anywhere anytime soon: They add to the longevity of each CoD season, give you more to grind for, and if you’re thorough and play enough to earn all the CoD Points, you can pretty much pay for your next pass—<em>for free</em>.</p>



<p>Details have already leaked regarding Black Ops and Warzone Season 1, so delve into Battle Pass talk.</p>

<p>Activision has yet to formally announce the Black Ops 6 Season 1 Battle Pass date; however, based on a Call of Duty and Caesers Pizza promotional crossover, <strong>Nov. 14</strong> looks to be the date Activision has penciled in for the Season One Battle Pass.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season One date</a> was spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@BobBetworkUK_</a> on Oct. 21, and they provided a screenshot, with a caption saying, “<strong>Black Ops 6 x Warzone Season 1 starts November 14th</strong>.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Caesers Pizza has already proven to be a great partner for Call of Duty fans by offering players the chance to grab <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double XP</a>. Now, you can start planning for Nov. 14, and get some pizza in for the start of Season One.</p>



<p>Naturally, the Season One Battle Pass is expected to go live at the same time as the new seasonal content. Long-story short, brace yourselves for the likely debut of the Black Ops 6 Battle Pass on Nov. 14!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-what-s-in-the-black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass">Do we know what’s in the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>Due to there being no official release date for Black Ops 6, we don’t know any of the content Activison has in store for Season One.</p>



<p>We do know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-nuketown-in-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown is coming to Black Ops 6</a>, <strong>but it won’t be part of the Season One content drop</strong>—the legendary map is returning on Nov. 1 to broaden the multiplayer’s large pool of maps.</p>



<p>For now, we anticipate the usual slew of contents usually seen in a mainline CoD content drop: New maps, new playlist game modes, new Operator Skins and cosmetics, new weapons, and of course, the Season One Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’ll be sure to update you once Activision does finally announce the Season one roadmap for BLOPS 6 and Warzone Season One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than most genres, survival horror feels rooted in time. It started with the methodical <em>Resident Evil</em> on the original PlayStation and is defined in part by limitation — a slow pace, grimy visuals, and scant resources to help amplify the scares. Many of those elements stemmed from the early, awkward days of 3D gaming, whether it was <em>Resident Evil</em>’s clunky controls, which made zombie chases more terrifying, or <em>Silent Hill</em>’s fog, which lent an iconic atmosphere while also letting the developers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/24196061/silent-hill-crash-bandicoot-tech-limitations">get around technical limitations of the time</a>.</p><p>And a few decades later, developers are still finding ways to bring the most important elements of those games — namely, the mood and scares — to modern horror without feeling dated.</p><p>The most obvious way to do this is keeping the style and tone of classic survival horror while updating the gameplay to make it more approachable. The most recent example of this is <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, the first release from horror movie studio Blumhouse’s new gaming label. Much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox"><em>Crow Country</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23428239/signalis-review-ps4-xbox-switch-pc"><em>Signalis</em></a>, it’s a game that looks like it was ripped right out of 1998; the visuals are blocky, the textures low-res. It gives the experience a grimy feel, which is just the right note for horror.</p><div><figcaption><em>Fear the Spotlight.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Blumhouse Games</cite></p></div><p><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> — developed by the two-person team at Cozy Game Pals — starts out simple enough, with two friends breaking into their high school to perform a seance in the library. But, of course, things go bad, and they get pulled into a nightmare realm that connects both to their own pasts and a dark mystery the school has been hiding for decades. It’s part coming-of-age story, part romance, and part true crime. But it’s all rendered in the crunchy style of PlayStation-era horror, which lends it an uneasy edge.</p><p>The game also lets you really focus on the story by streamlining the gameplay. There’s <em>a lot</em> of puzzle-solving; much like in early <em>Resident Evil</em> games, you’ll be fixing all kinds of complex mechanical problems and dealing with arcane statues and locks. But there’s almost no actual combat. Instead, you have little choice but to run and hide when the terrifying monsters appear. Some of the scariest moments of the game have you huddled under a desk, waiting for the creatures — which have deadly spotlights for faces — to pass.</p><p>In some ways, removing combat makes the game even scarier since you have no way to fight back. These moments in <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> reminded me a bit of stowing away in a locker in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6897307/alien-isolation-review"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a>, hoping the xenomorph couldn’t see me. The hazy, dirty visuals only amplify this feeling, as it’s often difficult to get a clear view of what’s ahead of you.</p><div><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Konami</cite></p></div><p>On the other side of the spectrum is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168204/silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-date-ps5-steam">recent remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>. Instead of creating a brand-new survival horror experience with modern sensibilities, it’s an attempt to take one of the genre’s most influential titles — a particularly idiosyncratic one at that — and reimagine it as a big-budget release in 2024. That has pros and cons. Like the remakes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc">classic <em>Resident</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199382/resident-evil-3-remake-review-ps4-xbox-pc-2-capcom"><em>Evil</em> games</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">the original <em>Dead Space</em></a>, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> looks and plays like a modern release. The visuals are crisp and detailed, instead of hazy and disorienting. And it controls like a well-tuned third-person action game. It’s immensely satisfying to swing a bat, whether you’re smashing in windows or fending off a living mannequin.</p><p>There’s a shift in tone. The modern <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is still scary. The level of realism makes the squirming enemies and cramped hotel hallways feel incredibly unsettling, and there’s a level of immersion that can be panic-inducing. But now it plays and feels like a lot of other games and is, for lack of a better word, a lot cleaner than the original. It’s no longer as weird and distinct. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16978294/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-remaster-ps4-review">the 2018 remake of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a>: a cover song that doesn’t replace the original but provides a different way of looking at it, one that’s welcoming for newcomers. (If only Konami made the original <em>Silent Hill 2</em> more accessible.)</p><p>The point is, these games show there is still plenty of room to do interesting things with survival horror. And they do it in a way that both connected to the genre’s history without being stifled by it. More importantly: they find new ways to scare.</p><p><small><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> and <em>Silent Hill 2</em> are both available now.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24279410/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>After a year, Finnish studio Remedy Entertainment has opened the gates to a mysterious location in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the 2023 third-person horror hit <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, known as <em>The Lake House</em>. In this short DLC, released just in time for Halloween, players step into the shoes of Kiran Estevez, the long-suffering agent of the mysterious Federal Bureau of Control we meet in the main game, who allies with <em>Alan Wake 2’s</em> protagonists, Alan Wake and Saga Anderson. Set before the events of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>The Lake House</em> sees Kiran recounting a horrifying event at the titular location to Saga, yet the plot is almost firmly removed from the main game itself.</p><p>This is both a boon and a curse, depending on what you were looking for. But as a bridge to the continuation of Remedy’s grand connected universe narrative — which also includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the supernatural thriller <em>Control</em></a> — it’s ideal. Instead of waving goodbye to Alan and Saga, Remedy is extending a hand to take us on its next weird journey.</p><p>Kiran is investigating a research station, where FBC researchers, doctors Jules and Diana Marmont and their teams, are looking into the effects of Cauldron Lake. In Remedy’s lore, there is a connection between the power of creating “art” and the power of otherworldly forces to misuse such gifts.</p><p>The Marmonts are experimenting on a painter, Rudolf Lane, who some might remember from the main game. Lane’s creativity has a tendency to illustrate — and possibly create — the future, much as Alan’s writing did. (God forbid those two ever make a comic book together.)&nbsp;I won’t spoil what the Marmonts did, save to say they were monsters long before any otherworldly forces came into the frame. Regardless, the Lake House is suddenly cut off and unresponsive to FBC HQ, resulting in Kiran investigating with a small team.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>Remedy has been playing with a connected universe since <em>Control</em>, and the Lake House is a firm bridge backward and forward to that story. Of course, being an <em>Alan Wake</em> DLC, players can expect the solid third-person survival horror of the main game.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lake House, as a setting, is as unnerving as most of the spaces in A<em>lan Wake 2</em>. However, there’s more of a focus on the brutalist and office-space aesthetics from <em>Control</em>, without the outside or natural environments that dominated about half of the main game. In the eerily quiet office spaces, there are visual wonders like looping hallways and rooms of infinite typewriters, which have been programmed to “write” like Alan Wake.&nbsp;</p><p>That last quirk appears to be a clear jab by Remedy’s writers at AI slop, with a page of Alan’s real writing saying, “The art was not art. Just content for the experiment.” Indeed, the whole thesis of <em>The Lake House</em> is the misuse of art for the acquisition of some end product, rather than relishing in the beauty art can create. This is all the more obvious when you figure out who the villain is and who has created the new terrifying humanoid paint beasts that slither out of the walls. Remedy is not subtle in its disdain for the corporatization of creativity, the reconfiguration of art into a harvest field of bland capitalistic fervor. There’s no love lost and much hate gained in the <em>Lake House</em>’s story, outlining the interaction between artistic freedom and corporate control: a golden hand wrapped around imagination’s throat.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>To say too much about this already short game would spoil it, so I won’t go into detail about the clever set pieces that would feel right at home in <em>Control</em>. Let’s just say, light switches and motels make a welcome return, as does a familiar and powerful character.&nbsp;</p><p>Kiran, unfortunately, does not mechanically demonstrate any prowess fighting otherworldly beings, despite her years as an FBC agent. She plays no different to Saga or Alan Wake, once again using a flashlight to whittle down enemies’ shadowy armor before unloading a satisfying number of bullets into their bodies. There is also only one new enemy type: the aforementioned long-limbed painting creatures who can only be destroyed with a new weapon Kiran discovers late in the story.&nbsp;</p><p>I would’ve liked some new ability or mechanic that demonstrates her years of experience in dealing with the weird. Instead, this is relegated to her interactions with the odd object / entity, being able to quickly control her fear, and knowing how to deal with recurring “items” <em>Control</em> veterans like myself know all too well.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the joy of the Lake House is discovering what occurred and experiencing the few floors for yourself. The DLC takes about two hours to complete. But in that short span of time, it made for not only a satisfying send-off of one of my favorite recent games but also a bridge back into the world of <em>Control</em>.</p><p>All signs seem to indicate Remedy will be taking the grand plot of this connected universe to an almost apocalyptic level. We can probably expect to see plenty of returning characters, including Kiran herself, as Remedy steers us through its creepy weird lake of stories.</p><p><small>The Lake House<em> expansion for </em>Alan Wake 2<em> is available now.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whether you’re starting the Black Ops 6 Campaign for the first time or you’re halfway through the action-packed adventure, we’ve provided a complete Black Ops 6 Campaign Mission List (in order) to help you track your progress.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Campaign is a veritable rollercoaster that throws you around with explosions, and sends your brain in loops with psychological intrigue.

<p>CoD Campaigns usually come in for criticism for their short lengths, but the Black Ops 6 story has received high praise for its variety, character depth, and spectacular action. I understand time is precious, so here’s everything we know about the BLOPS 6 Campaign, how many missions it has, and what to expect.</p>

<p>The Black Ops 6 Campaign has <strong>11 main story missions</strong> to complete. However, the bulk of the main content is segmented, with many intervals and rest points happening between missions at “The Rook”—your team’s safehouse and base of operations.</p>



<p><strong>*Minor spoiler warning* <br></strong>You know why you’re here, but I’m still forewarning that the rest of the guide reveals the name of every mission in Black Ops 6. This is your last chance if you don’t wish to know and want to be surprised.</p>

<p>Here’s every Black Ops 6 Campaign mission, and interlude, in order:</p>



<ol>
<li>Bishop Takes Rook</li>



<li>The Rook—Arrival</li>



<li>Blood Feud</li>



<li>The Rook—Assemble</li>



<li>Most Wanted</li>



<li>The Rook—Reunion</li>



<li>Hunting Season</li>



<li>The Cradle</li>



<li>The Rook—Reconciliation</li>



<li>Emergence</li>



<li>The Rook—Recovery</li>



<li>High Rollers</li>



<li>The Rook—Contact</li>



<li>Ground Control</li>



<li>Under The Radar</li>



<li>The Rook—Interrogation</li>

<li>Checkmate</li>



<li>Separation Anxiety—Lies</li>



<li>Checkmate—Detonation</li>



<li>Separation Anxiety—Truth</li>



<li>Checkmate: Black Sea</li>
</ol>



<p>The main missions are self-explanatory, but The Rook is one of the most interesting aspects of the Campaign as it allows Marshall, Woods, and the rest of the team to interact—allowing their personalities to blossom before our eyes—and use the money earned during the Campaign to improve your base of operations—as well as buy upgrades to use in the Campaign missions.</p>

            <p>Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> is currently sitting on a "mixed" Steam user score as players on PC report performance issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Threads on the game's Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/">discussion</a> pages and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/top/">subreddit</a> show players are trying all kinds of things to ameliorate the issue, from uninstalling other applications, removing auto-start apps, and disabling the anti-cheats of other games.</p>
<p>"Even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885458077/">deleting all folders</a> off [the] pc and re-downloading everything" hasn't worked.</p>

<p>"Every time I click start campaign my game crashes to desktop. No problem's playing multiplayer though," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885457921/">commented</a> one player.</p>
<p>"My campaign starts. I can play for a few minutes and THAN [sic] crash to desktop without any error messages, driver all new!" said one respondent.</p>
<p>"I bought it yesterday and haven't been able to play one single game," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885476188/">added</a> another unhappy player. "It always closes when I try to start the game. I reinstalled it and still, I cant even load into the menu. What in the actual ****."</p>
<p>Responses include "same, hecking stupid", "still the same for me", and "it's gotta be a[n] Activision issue I hope they fix it fast it’s unfair".</p>
<p>"Same here - rubbish. Why do nobody test their games anymore before releasing them," opined one particularly unhappy commenter.</p>
<p>Another simply <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shulby/recommended/2933620/">wrote</a>: "Call of Crashes 6".</p>
<p>As yet, there's been no formal word on Call of Duty's social media channels acknowledging the issues, but of 2200+ Steam reviews posted so far, almost half have been negative, and most negative reviews seem to reference performance issues. Others are chiefly unhappy with the Call of Duty launcher.</p>
<p>Did you see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's new arachnophobia mode</a>? Activision's solution somehow makes everything even more horrifying, by robbing its zombie spiders of legs and turning them into something arguably worse.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even if you hone your protagonist, V, into a stealth ninja assassin, the neon-soaked Night City is still frequently the stage for tense combat encounters. That is, however, until Somewhat Damaged, one of the Phantom Liberty expansion’s final quests. Inside a bunker buried deep beneath the city, Cyberpunk 2077 leaves its RPG structure behind and morphs into a survival horror. A relentless robotic hunter stalks you through chambers and corridors, and there’s nothing your weapons can do to stop it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To find out how this level and its terrifying mechanical monster were created, we spoke to staff from developer CD Projekt Red. With their insight, we examine how Somewhat Damaged makes use of logical environment design, increasingly stressful objectives, and resourceful AI scripting to manifest Phantom Liberty’s terrifying crescendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Liberty tells the story of Song So Mi, better known as Songbird, and Reed, two NUSA agents and former partners. Throughout the campaign it’s revealed that Songbird is on a personal mission to escape the toxic grip of her employer. If you help her, she will save you from your terminal brain virus (AKA Johnny Silverhand) using a Neural Matrix she plans to steal. As the campaign reaches its climax, you’re given a choice: work with Songbird, or betray her and let Reed take her into NUSA custody. Choosing that second option triggers Somewhat Damaged, a terrifying final quest that’s unique to this branch of the story. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-songbird-betrayal-1729593761197.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>During the Firestarter mission you can choose to betray Songbird and capture her. This triggers the Somewhat Damaged finale questline. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Somewhat Damaged sees a devastated, mentally unstable Songbird flee to Cynosure, an abandoned facility beneath Night City. There she connects with the Blackwall, a defence network that protects the world from unknowable digital horrors, and activates a rogue AI to stalk, hunt, and kill you. Within the dark, decaying corridors of the bunker, all you can do is run and hide. It’s a bold left turn for a game normally so focused on action.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really wanted to do something Eldritch horror,” says Patrick Mills, CD Projekt Red’s former Cyberpunk 2077 loremaster and the person responsible for Somewhat Damaged’s initial design document. “I went to [quest director] Paweł Sasko and I said, ‘Hey, I want to do this. A lot of people aren't going to like this, but I think the people who do are really going to like it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From near enough the very beginning, Mills wanted to create the quest alongside Miles Tost, a senior level designer he knew would be on the same page. Tost immediately agreed to join the project. “I wanted to make something that was way out of my comfort zone,” he says, “and just pushed everything that I knew about working with our engine. We tried to come up with how we could push our technology and our encounter system to create this truly unique experience for the player.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Invincible Beast</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like some kind of restless spirit from beyond the veil, Songbird’s rogue AI possesses a Cerberus. It’s a maintenance robot, but don’t let that basic purpose fool you: this is a relentless, powerful beast. And, unlike any robot you’ve faced in the campaign before this point, it’s completely impervious to damage or hacking. The first thing the development team had to do, then, was to teach players that the Cerberus wasn’t a boss to fight, but a monster to avoid at all costs.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The ideal of a great RPG boss fight is a boss that acknowledges the skills that you've chosen in order to defeat the boss,” says Mills. “But in this case, I went completely against that. None of your abilities are really going to help you here. We just have to disable all of those things because if you give a player the ability to chase the thing off or to disable the thing, if your guns do anything to this thing, that's what players are going to try to do to get through it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We need them to understand the very first time it kills them there's nothing you can do,” he explains. “It's the only way to immediately communicate that idea.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/cp2077-cerberus-render-1728571847624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The original concept render of the Cerberus maintenance robot. Image credit: Filippo Ubertino / CD Projekt Red.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To put players in the right headspace, the development team carefully designed the path towards the initial Cerberus encounter with a focus on tone. After betraying Songbird in the previous quest, Reed and V attempt to capture her in an explosive raid on a MaxTac convoy. From that point onwards, as V follows Songbird into the bunker, things begin to veer further and further away from the experience you typically expect of Cyberpunk 2077. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I need to make sure as you're moving through this space that there isn't any shooting,” says Mills. “There's as little traditional gameplay as possible. I'm moving you through thematic airlocks, one after the other, to just keep that sense of space between those things. The objective is to make sure that the player understands that it's a different game now.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That different game is, perhaps rather obviously, partially informed by a landmark survival horror. “The Cerberus monster itself came from Alien: Isolation,” reveals Paweł Gąska, who took over quest design duties from Mills. “They nailed this idea of an unpredictable predator that is hunting you on the level and is keeping you tense even when it's absent. We thought ‘This is exactly what we want.’” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving such an experience is easier said than done, though. The entirety of Alien: Isolation revolves around the cat and mouse gameplay between the player and the xenomorph, and so developer Creative Assembly could put significant time and resources into coding its sophisticated artificial intelligence system. CDPR, on the other hand, only needed such a hunter for one single quest… a quest that many players wouldn’t even experience thanks to the branching narrative. And so the team had to find a way to replicate that hunted feeling using craftier techniques. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>From the robot’s perspective, it's never actively actually hunting the player, sorry!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first section of the level, known internally as the outer bunker, is a collection of five rooms linked by a T-shaped corridor. “The game does a check of where V is,” explains Tost. “Is V in this room? No. Okay. Is V in that room? No. Okay. Is V in that room? Yes. And then it basically sends the Cerberus into that room.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a fairly straightforward process, but there are layers to the programming that ensure the robot feels authentically autonomous. For example, there are multiple different patrol paths that the robot can follow. When the system completes its room check and discovers where you are, it randomly assigns one of those paths to the Cerberus. The robot then follows that circuit, which will by design eventually lead it to the room you were discovered in.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From the robot’s perspective, it's never actively actually hunting the player, sorry!” laughs Tost. “It happens to walk within the area that V is in. So that coincides, which is a bit of a problem for V, but really the robot is just on a walk.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/cp2077-cerberus-blueprint-1728571771254.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Blueprints of the Cerberus robot. Image credit: Filippo Ubertino / CD Projekt Red.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be just an illusion, but that doesn’t keep the terror from feeling very real. That result is partly thanks to Tost and the team realising that “the horror really lives in the absence of the robot compared to its presence.” That’s why close attention was paid to the Cerberus’ distinct audio signature. Its six metal legs thud against the flooring with a regular pattern, allowing you to approximate its position even when it’s far out of view. You can hear the whine of its servo motors as it climbs into the air vents that snake around the facility – a signal that the corridors are now free of its presence. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But making this hunter operate as intended was a much more difficult task than making it sound right. Before the final Cerberus was a prototype based on Royce, the cybernetic psychopath from the main Cyberpunk 2077 campaign, but his programming “had the issue of not really understanding when to stop running after you and fighting you,” says Tost. Royce was later replaced with another enemy, the Blood Ritual cyberpsycho, who “was less of what we wanted in the final version, but functionally worked a bit better.” Finally, after a less than ideal length of time, the final Cerberus mesh was given to the design team. “He worked even worse than both [Royce and the cyberpsycho]!” laughs Tost. “He would just glitch in animations. Most of the time he didn’t have animations!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These difficulties almost saw the entire idea of a stalking enemy scrapped. “There were quite a few moments throughout development where we were this [close to] just making it a combat encounter,” Tost reveals. “There was actually a long time where we did have a fight with the robot planned, but we really couldn't get it to work. That basically forced us to really commit to [the hunter idea].”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Haunted Bunker</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cerberus is an important part of Somewhat Damaged, but avoiding it is not your primary task. Instead, this predator is a constant threat as you attempt to fulfil your main goal of venturing deeper into the Cynosure facility and finding Songbird at its core. Accessing the core first requires opening the colossal bulkhead door that connects the inner and outer bunker, done by disabling four different data terminals: Alpha, Bravo, Sierra, and Victor. Each is located in different rooms around the facility. It’s hardly a scary prospect for a horror-themed level, but a smart shift in how the world is presented makes the simple act of finding computers much more interesting than you’d first expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The belief that I had back then, together with Patrick and the rest of the team, was that in order to really put the player into this horror mindset, we need to get their attention and their eyes on what was happening as much as possible,” says Tost. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-cynosure-map-1729593419861.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The in-game map of Cynosure's outer bunker area. The four dataterms are plotted to help players locate their objectives. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The solution was to eliminate the minimap. When you enter Cynosure, Songbird hacks your GPS link. This removes the distraction from your screen, but also cuts you off from your location data and objective markers. That manifested a whole new challenge – the bunker had to be designed as a space that clearly communicated its pathways through architecture and in-game signage. While the majority of Night City’s geography does adhere to some level of real-world logic, this was a new and unfamiliar approach for Somewhat Damaged. Thankfully, Tost had recently conducted a deep-dive analysis on how immersive sim developer Arkane Studios approaches its best-in-class level design. The findings of that investigation formed the bedrock of Cynosure’s layout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What we came up with was that we gave each room a name, and we put the names very visible on the level,” explains Tost. “We needed to have an in-game map. We needed to have this terminal where you can look at the status of the door and for it to be really, really clear that it has four locks and these locks are linked to these data terminals that you need to get to them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How does the player understand which data terminal is activated and which one isn't and all that? We worked with the UI team in a collaboration and they really helped us with that.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The inner bunker tends to be much more stressful. The rooms are smaller, the spaces are more claustrophobic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This meticulously designed, easy-to-read environment is just one of the components that make this whole level work as intended. The second is the Cerberus and its clever AI behaviour. The final piece comes in the form of objectives. With the Cerberus inflicting so much pressure, the mission’s tasks had to be carefully balanced. They couldn’t ask players to do anything overly-complex. And so opening the bulkhead door is simply a case of activating four data terminals. The resulting challenge is not the terminals themselves, but the tense exploration required to find them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a high stress environment so it's difficult to make complicated decisions,” explains Tost. “So we make the [objective] difficult through the Cerberus being around, but we keep the things themselves simple.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of this is really inspired by other horror games and looking at what they're doing,” Mills reveals. “What is it that you have to do in Soma or Alien: Isolation to progress? Well, the gameplay comes from you're being hunted. You need to go and press this switch and operate this device and when you're doing it, you can't see behind you, and there’s that fear of this thing lurking.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While much of the objective design was fuelled by the quest’s horror approach, the team still had to ensure that some element of Cyberpunk’s RPG design remained. “Your objective has to give you some chance [against the indestructible Cerberus],” says Gąska. “You are not a passive person here. You are disempowered, you cannot do what you've been doing before, but bits of [your character build] remain. If you invested in the stealth tree, your footsteps will not be as loud, so you have more room to check stuff out.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-cerberus-1729604346316.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>There is no way to defeat the Cerberus in combat. Stealth and smarts are your only weapons in this fight for survival.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To allow all players, not just those with high stealth stats, to successfully avoid the Cerberus while exploring the outer bunker, a number of hiding spots were built into the design of each room and corridor. Such areas of cover are signposted through lighting, with flashing bulbs indicating safe havens. “One benefit of having the fixed patrol lines [for the Cerberus] was that I could predict for each patrol point where cover should be to make each and every one of them fair,” says Tost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all four data terminals activated, the door to the inner bunker opens and you can continue your search for Songbird. The next task is to shut down the facility's core, which requires you to sabotage three key systems: the Neural Network, the Datafront’s firewall devices, and the Thermic Control. Similar to the outer bunker, you once again need to cautiously explore the environment to find these objectives, but this time each task involves more risk and danger. With the Cerberus still very much on your tail, the section ratchets up stress and panic levels.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The idea was always to have the outer bunker be the tutorial area, and the [inner bunker] was where we wanted to switch it from just the sheer terror of being in this space to you being confronted by that thing much, much more often,” Tost reveals. “So this section tends to be much more stressful. The rooms are smaller, the spaces are more claustrophobic.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We're really forcing the player to interact with the robot in a way that they know will end badly for them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The objectives are no longer just you hooking yourself to the system and shutting it down,” says Gąska. “You have to be more visceral, you have to rip the cables, you have to destroy stuff.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That destruction always, without fail, summons the Cerberus. “We're really forcing the player to interact with the robot and the environment in a way that they know will end badly for them,” says Tost with a smile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all three objectives complete, the facility goes into emergency lockdown, trapping you in the observation room. It makes you a sitting duck for the Cerberus, which of course turns up for one final hunt. Thankfully the room is arranged in a circle, allowing just enough space for you to stay out of the patrolling robot’s vision cone provided you keep moving. It makes for a white-knuckle finale to Night City’s most terrifying game of hide-and-seek. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have this issue of balancing how often the robot should be there,” explains Tost. “In this particular section, which generally is smaller, we had moments where the player would be able to simply speed run it without the robot having any chance to show itself. So the decision was made to just lock the door and you have to endure the robot being in there.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-observation-1729604171139.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The circular design of the Observation Room means you can stay one step ahead of the robot's patrol during the emergency lockdown sequence. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With the objective locked in, Tost settled on using the observation room as the Cerberus’ final hunting ground, as no matter what order you complete the inner bunker objectives, it's always the last room you progress through. To suit the envisioned gameplay, the room was increased in size to create a large, circuit-loop environment.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The patrol there is basically just an ‘O’, and what the player needs to do in order to hide is basically either tail him or be ahead of him,” Tost says. “But you can’t stay static.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Successfully avoiding the Cerberus here isn’t the final showdown, though. That comes as you head back to Core Control to shut the system down for good. But rather than an explosive battle, the Cerberus is instead defeated thanks to an emotional heart-to-heart with Songbird. Convinced by your words and worn down by the world, she finally calls off the hunt and powers down the robot.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned by Tost, an early draft of the quest involved a traditional boss battle with the robot. Its temporary inclusion was an admission of defeat – a blip in the design timeline that marks a period when the team just couldn’t get the Cerberus to work correctly. But it wasn’t just the team’s determination to realise their ambition that saw the boss battle wiped from the level. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We decided that [defeating the Cerberus in a boss battle] would give you a sense of victory,” says Gąska. “But we don't want you to have that sense of victory. We want you to be in the stage of, ‘Okay, damn, I survived this’ and not ‘I finally killed that bastard.’ And then we let you settle down, and after all this we hit you with the big question at the end.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Final Choice</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two missions prior, Phantom Liberty serves up the campaign’s biggest choice: will you stand by Songbird, or betray her? During Somewhat Damaged, in the very heart of the Cynosure bunker, you reach the campaign’s most important choice. You betrayed Songbird to get here, but will you stick by your decision? Will you force this devastated woman into the clutches of the people who broke her, or will you allow her one final mercy and end her suffering – knowing full well that if you do, your chance to cure your own terminal illness will be lost forever? It’s a duology of decisions that demanded a huge amount of work to ensure they felt both challenging and satisfying for players to navigate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Do I help So Mi or do I betray So Mi?” asks Mills. “And if you help So Mi, you learn things that make you doubt your choice. And then in the other path, where you decide to betray So Mi, you're going to learn things that make you doubt your choice. And that's really important because then we offer you another choice at the end of those two paths. Do you regret your decision now? How do you feel about this? So it was really necessary to get So Mi's story in there once we had a better idea of who she was, what her backstory was, and what those dilemmas were going to be.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-flashback-1729593557781.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Songbird's final flashback depicts a birthday party long before she had become a cybernetic weapon. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To reveal the final, vital pieces of Songbird’s story, a series of flashback visions were added to V’s journey through the bunker. Each one shows a key moment of So Mi’s life, pulling the curtain back on her mistakes and misfortunes.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The bunker was a metaphor of going deep into Songbird’s mind,” says Gąska. “But there are two sides of Songbird. One is this caged bird. We wanted to tell you that ‘Okay, she did betray you and all that, but while she's wrong, she was also a victim of circumstances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those circumstances are depicted through each flashback. The first shows Songbird meeting with Phantom Liberty’s villain, Kurt Hansen, during the events of the expansion itself. Each subsequent flashback winds the clock further and further back. “You have her operation, so you see her still without cyberware,” explains Gąska. “You have her oath to Myers, just like you had your oath. You have her first encounter with Reed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then you jump into Brooklyn, where it's an even happier time,” he continues. “This is the core of her identity, her happy place, where she's safe from whatever else was happening in the world. Where she had friends, where she had relationships. Relationships that she herself failed and when it all went down she was forced into this life. We wanted you to have this knowledge because you would soon be choosing what to do with her. If you just see her as this crazy person who betrays you, you will just be antagonistic towards her. You already chose [to hand her over to] Reed once, so there is no reason for you to not choose him again unless we give you additional information.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I'm not that concerned if people are having fun. Am I engaged? That's the important thing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the flashbacks tell a very sympathetic story, CD Projekt Red prides itself on moral ambiguity. Its narrative branches are rarely, if ever, a choice between good and evil. To communicate the two sides of the upcoming choice, the visions of Songbird’s troubled life are delivered while her broken, current-day self is trying to kill you with a deadly robot. “She is an unstable individual that is packed with top cyberware and has an active connection to AIs from beyond Blackwall,” says Gąska. “She is like a cyber nuke in this world, and left alone she's extremely dangerous. If you think that running away from one maintenance robot in one small area of the world was scary, think of what would happen if she hacked the whole of Arasaka headquarters!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armed with that knowledge, you can make your final decision: will you hand Songbird over to the NUSA, the organisation that ruined her life and turned her into a cybernetic weapon? Or will you grant her wish of death, finally allowing her some peace?  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Killing So Mi felt to me like the mercy option,” says Mills. “Returning her to the people who effectively tortured her should feel gross. It should feel really icky. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-songbird-choice-1729593638483.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Somewhat Damaged's final choice asks you to kill Songbird. This act of mercy will deny you the cure to the Relic that is slowly erasing your mind. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“She's broken, she's pathetic,” he says. “She is someone who has been tortured. She's been mistreated, and whatever your feelings about her, I want you to feel sympathy. I want you to feel that nobody deserves this. That whatever she's done, that's wrong. This is too much. This is not okay. I want you to really be torn up when you make that decision whether to mercy kill her or give her back to Reed. I want the player to find that place in themselves that has sympathy for broken things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not that concerned if people are having fun,” Mills admits. “Am I engaged? That's the important thing. Are my emotions being played with? How am I doing it? And I don't want you to feel manipulated either. I want you to just go with it, feel the vibes, go with the vibes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Somewhat Damaged is, arguably, not a very fun mission – at least in the traditional sense of the word. It’s an incredibly stressful experience in which you must face Phantom Liberty’s most terrifying foe using a set of unfamiliar gameplay tools. It forces you to confront one of Cyberpunk’s most depressing storylines and then asks you to permanently pull the plug on one of its best characters. It is, in almost every way, a bad time. And yet that’s what makes it one of CD Projekt Red’s finest ever creations. It is undeniably engaging thanks to its complete commitment to the vision; a vision that jettisons many of the game’s fundamentals in the search for something special. The result is a truly unique mission. This is a horror level through and through. Of course it isn’t meant to be fun. It’s meant to be terrifying. And that’s exactly what Something Damaged is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hbada-e3-office-gaming-chair-brings-ergonomic-design/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When it comes to keeping user comfort and health a priority, <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">HBADA takes the lead</a>, as their commitment to bringing ergonomic design through cutting-edge technology and advanced material is well-known in the industry. Its ongoing efforts in establishing technological leadership and improving ergonomics are attributed to 16 years of experience in finding customer-centric solutions and marking their professionalism and products in the industry. With over 10 million global users, the company definitely doesn’t need any introductions.</p>
<p>All of this intense experience is reflected through its latest HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair, which supports longer sitting durations and is the perfect choice for those looking for a blend of style and comfort.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is designed to promote a healthier lifestyle and is packed with features that make it stand out. Some of its key specs include:</p>
<h3>T-Shape Support System for Better Posture</h3>
<p>The HBADA E3 Office Chair has a T-shaped support structure that is meant to address the three pain points generally experienced during prolonged sitting: waist, neck, and shoulders. This helps in aligning and correcting posture by offering extended support to the lumbar regions.</p>
<h3>3-Zone Elastic Lumbar Support</h3>
<p>When users sit for longer durations, lower back pain seems inevitable, and the industry is continuously working on addressing this issue. HBADA has led in this category with its Three-Zone Elastic Lumbar Support, which can rotate both inward and outward and adjust to all body types and sizes, which can help reduce strain experienced during extensive sitting due to the support that tends to imitate the natural curve of the body.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>4D Headrest with Dual-Axis Neck Pillow</h3>
<p>Not only does it cater to the <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">back issues that 9-5 workers and gamers</a> generally tend to experience during work or gaming, but it also addresses neck pain issues by providing proper support that helps relieve cervical pressure. The dual-axis rotation of 70 degrees and the option to adjust the pillow both vertically and horizontally help distribute the pressure and allow for comprehensive neck support.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>6D Mechanical Armrest</h3>
<p>The armrest also offers the option to adjust the seating by adjusting the height, depth, and angles at about six different degrees. This freedom helps reducing the strain on shoulders and maintaining proper posture during work, gaming, or even leisure time by providing elbow and forearm support.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>High Elastic Mesh Fabric</h3>
<p>Not only is the option to adjust the armrest and offer lumbar support one of the selling points of the E3 chair, but the material used also makes it truly stand out. The high elastic mesh fabric is breathable and allows for airflow, which helps keep users feeling cool and comfortable, especially during longer periods of sitting. The fabric is easy to maintain and offers durability as it does not easily wear and tear.</p>
<h3>AUTO Gravity-Sensing Chassis</h3>
<p>The best thing about the HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is that there is minimal need to make adjustments manually. The chassis automatically adjusts the recline according to the user's body weight and posture and distributes weight evenly for comfortable sitting. The recline function is extensive, as it can adjust to 140 degrees, making it ideal for supporting full-body rest.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In 2024, HBADA E3 Office Chair was awarded the prestigious French Design Award – Gold Award. The 16 years that HBADA team has served in the industry not only helps it establish itself as a global technology leader but also pushes it to continuously deliver optimal health-driven solutions that actually improve lifestyle. The company also carries a number of certifications, including the German IGR Ergonomics Certification, and also collaborates with the American ICA Chiropractic Association doctors.</p>
<p>Whether you work from home, looking to update your office chairs, or just want a solidly built chair that supports your gaming activity, look no further because the E3 Ergonomic Chair brings it all at an affordable price. The HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is perfect for an office or home setting, as its ergonomic design helps promote good posture and reduce perpetual strain on the body. Considering the longterm benefits it delivers, this may be the upgrade you need in your life to save your neck and lower back from longterm damage. The E3 comes in 3 color options, including Gray, Black, and Pink. HBADA E3 is available on <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" rel="sponsored noopener">both the official store</a> and via <a href="https://amzn.to/4dkttNO" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s the trickier of the two clock changing weekends, with time falling back by an hour overnight and in theory giving everyone an extra hour in bed. What’s actually going to happen is that a lot of kids will still wake up at the same time, and pets are going to demand feeding an hour “early” for at least the next fortnight, which is going to see an awful lot of things knocked off shelves and tables by mardy cats.</p>
<p>Great for childless and pet-less gamers, though, who’ve got an extra hour to spend with Black Ops 6, or whatever else tickles their fancy tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Xbox remains committed to "bringing great games to more people on more devices", and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-relevance-reinvention-satya-nadella-v91xc/">LinkedIn</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was "a consequential time for our company, our industry, and the world", and that "ultimately, [Microsoft's] mission requires that [it] translate technology into empowerment for everyone".</p>

<p>"We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem," Nadella said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the CEO also confirmed the company held publishing rights to 20 game franchises that "have generated over $1bn in lifetime revenue", and listed six of them. Whilst the recently acquired Call of Duty series is clearly one of them, it was curiously absent from Nadella's list.</p><p>"We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue - from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, Diablo, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love - where, when, and how they want.</p>
<p>"Finally, we brought four of our fan-favourite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms."</p>
<p>Yesterday we reported that Microsoft boss Nadella will earn a wallet-busting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs">$79.1m (£60.9m) this financial year, up 63 percent on his compensation for 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The huge boost to Nadella's pay in both cash and stock, announced by Microsoft earlier this week, comes after a positive year overall for the company's financial revenues - but a turbulent 12 months for its employees. 2024 has seen two mass layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 staff laid off in January</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">a further 650 Xbox employees were shown the door</a> in September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set? In this article, we'll take a look at what's inside the box, and see if it's the best way for new <em>Kill Team</em> players to start playing, along with seeing what it has for veteran <em>Kill Team</em> players.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the launch box for the current edition, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review">Operation Hivestorm here</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Starter Set contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Starter Handbook</li>
	<li>Angels of Death kill team (7x Space Marines)</li>
	<li>Plague Marine kill team (7x Death Guard)</li>
	<li>2x Operative Reference Sheets (1 for each kill team)</li>
	<li>Game board and MDF&nbsp;terrain</li>
	<li>Tokens, dice and card-measuring tools</li>
</ul><p>All of the miniatures included in the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set are from the collectible Warhammer Heroes sets. The included Space Maries are those from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-heroes-strike-force-justian-review">Strike Force Justain set we covered</a> for the last edition of <em>Kill Team. </em>All of the miniatures push out from the sprue (no need to cut them) and are push-fit, so they also don't require glue, which makes them perfect for those starting out in the wargaming hobby, as no hobby tools are needed.</p>

<p>The scenery is also beginner friendly, and is push-fit, pre-painted mdf that slots together (and can be reconstructed for easy transport). This, combined with the push-fit miniatures mean that from opening the box to playing can be extremely quick.</p>

<p>The<i>&nbsp;Kill Team </i>Starter Set is the complete package for your introduction to <em>Kill Team</em> and it contains everything you need to start playing. It is very much aimed at the beginner wargamer though and doesn't contain the full rules for <em>Kill Team</em> (we discuss what you need to get next to continue your <em>Kill Team</em> journey below). This means that players of the last edition of <em>Kill Team</em> won't need to pick this up, as the rulebook is a tutorial handbook and the 2 included kill teams can be picked up separately by getting the Warhammer Heroes sets they belong to. But for those new to wargaming or <em>Kill Team</em>, this is the perfect set to get you playing as it contains everything in a single box.</p>

<h2>What Kill Teams Do You Get In The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>The<i> Kill Team</i> Starter Set contains 2 kill teams, both with miniatures from the Warhammer Heroes lines.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=DJ9o9Tt4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=MeZ5WUMq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Angels of Death</h4>

<p>The included Angels of Death kill team is the repackaged Strike Force Justain from the previous edition of <em>Kill Team</em>. The rules for them on the included reference sheet are slightly different from those in the full <em>Kill Team</em> rules, and the profiles we discuss below are from the Starter Set (we discuss how to take the Angels of Death kill team beyond the Starter Set in the section below).</p>

<p>The Angels of Death kill team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Space Marine Captain - A close combat specialist armed with a plasma pistol and power fist, which can only be blocked with critical success, making it hard for your opponent to avoid damage.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Sergeant - The kill team's second in command armed with a bolt rifle that reduces your opponent's save dice on a critical hit.</li>
	<li>Assault Intersessor Warrior - A close combat specialist armed with a heavy bolt pistol and chainsword.</li>
	<li>Eliminator Sniper - A ranged specialist with 3 fire modes, the accurate executioner, hyperfrag with blast for multiple targets, and the armor-penetrating and high critical hit damage mortis.</li>
	<li>Heavy Intercessor Gunner - Another ranged specialist armed with a high rate of fire heavy bolter.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Warrior with auto bolt rifle - The auto bolt rifle has the torrent special rule, which can be used to make additional attacks against all visible enemies within 1 inch of your original target.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Warrior with bolt rifle - The standard bolt rifle gets piercing on a critical hit, which makes it harder to enemies to save against.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=PihfGyt1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=AKAPrE7P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Plague Marines</h4>

<p>The Plague Marine kill team is a new faction, having not had a dedicated kill team release in the last edition (only in the <em>Kill Team</em> compendium released at the start of the last edition). They currently only have the starter set rules, and not full rules on the Kill Team app (which may change after the release of the Starter Set). As such, the profiles we discuss below are from the Starter Set.</p>

<p>The Plague Marines kill team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Plague Marine Champion - A close combat specialist armed with a plasma pistol and plague sword, which lets you gain a critical success from a standard success if you didn't roll any critical hits.</li>
	<li>Malignant Plaguecaster - A psychic user with 2 spell options, the short-range entropy with extremely high crit damage, and severe which helps you gain a critical hit, and plague wind, which can roll an attack against every visible enemy within 2 inches of the original target.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Bombardier - A grenade-armed Plague Marine, carrying a blight grenade with a 2-inch blast radius, so even enemies that aren't visible or behind cover aren't safe.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Fighter - The fighter only carries a&nbsp;flail of corruption, a close combat weapon, which can only be blocked with critical hits. It has the shock special rule, which makes your opponent discard a success when struck with one of your successes.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Heavy Gunner - Armed with the short-range plague spewer, it can target all visible enemies within 2 inches of the original target.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Icon Bearer - Only armed with a short-range bolt pistol and plague knife, the icon they carry means it's easier for them to capture objectives as their APL is considered higher than their stat card.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Warrior - The standard Plague Marine operative comes with a bolter, which has the same stats as the Angels of Death bolt rifle, but without the piercing crit special rule.</li>
</ul><h2>Where Do I Go After The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>Once you've played through the <em>Kill Team</em> tutorials in the Starter Handbook from the Starter Set, you'll be ready to play full games of <em>Kill Team</em>. You will be able to initially upgrade to the <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules for free, via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/xfV8vUOg/download-the-kill-team-app-and-faction-rules-today/">Kill Team app</a>&nbsp;and you can also download the <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules and the full rules for the Angles of Death kill team via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/kill-team/">Kill Team downloads page</a>. The next stage is to purchase the <em>Kill Team</em> Core Rules and you'll be able to play full games of <em>Kill Team</em>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to use the included kill teams using the full rules, you should note the Angels of Death kill team isn't a legal kill team using the full rules. You can't take both the Space Marine Captain and the Intercessor Sergeant, but you can use the Sergeant as another Intercessor Warrior. You also can't take both the Intercessor Heavy Gunner and Eliminator Sniper in the same kill team, so you will need to add another Assault Intercessor, Intercessor Gunner, or Intercessor Warrior. If you pick up a pack of Intercessors, you will have more than enough to build the options for the different armament options for the Intercessor Warriors and Intercessor Gunners, and a pack of Assault Intercessors (or the cheaper Assault Intercessors and Paint Set) will give you all the options for a full roster.</p>

<p>The Plague Marines currently don't have full <em>Kill Team</em> rules, but I'm hopeful they release them online to coincide with the Starter Set release.</p>

<p>Or if you fancy a different kill team, you can check out the rules for free via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/kill-team/">Kill Team downloads</a> page and see which of the currently released 33 kill teams that take your fancy, and then pick up the box for them. Some kill teams require 2 boxes to be able to build all the options.</p>

<p>I really like what Games Workshop have done with the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set. It's not an essential purchase for veteran <em>Kill Team</em> players unless they don't have the 2 included kill teams from their release as Warhammer Heroes, but it does help onboard new <em>Kill Team</em> players very well. The starter handbook does a good job of taking players through their first few games with 2 very easy-to-pilot kill teams, and it makes it very easy to move into full games. We'll have to see what happens with the Plague Marine rules, but it would have been nice to have an additional Space Marine miniature so that it's a legal kill team out of the box, or at least have made the Angels of Death rules work with this kill team as it is.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>If you're brand new to wargaming, or <em>Kill Team</em>, then this is the perfect place to start. The miniatures are easy to put together, and the handbook does a great job of introducing the rules and setting you up to move into <em>Kill Team</em> lite, and then the full rules. If you're a veteran player, there's nothing extra here other than the miniatures and the new mdf scenery, so if you have them already, you won't need the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set, but if you don't have either kill team, then this may be a cost-effective way to get them.</p>
