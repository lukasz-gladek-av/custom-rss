The film framed its titular hero as more of an idea than a man and, by doing so, created space for one of Miller’s most riveting new characters to shine.&nbsp;</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23983452/furiosa-mad-max-trailer"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Mad Saga</em></a> — Warner Bros’ new <em>Fury Road </em>prequel — attempts a similar kind of mythologization as it jumps back in time to a point when green things still grew in the apocalypse. Compared to <em>Fury Road</em>’s deranged bombast, <em>Furiosa </em>feels like a leaner, more artfully realized vision of raw humanity struggling to survive in spite of itself. But the new film has a tendency to treat its namesake as the fulcrum around which a story is happening instead of someone participating in it, which is a shame considering how she’s the big draw.</p><p>Whereas previous <em>Mad Max </em>films have essentially been snapshots from a war-torn future, <em>Furiosa </em>chronicles the entire young adulthood of Furiosa (Alyla Browne in flashbacks and Anya Taylor-Joy closer to the present), one of the last people to know what it was like to grow up in the fabled Green Place of Many Mothers. Furiosa is just one of many kids able to truly thrive in the Green Place thanks to its natural abundance (read: fresh food and water) and relative seclusion within the treacherous Australian wasteland. But for all the safety Furiosa feels in her early years, she’s also keenly aware of how tenuous that security is. When her people are ultimately attacked by raiders, she knows the Green Place’s survival in secrecy hinges on the outsiders’ deaths.</p><p>By opening <em>Furiosa </em>in the Green Place and foregrounding it as the environment that first shaped Furiosa herself, Miller establishes early on how interested he is in using this film to illustrate the durability of ideas. As Furiosa’s snatched away from her idyllic home and enslaved by sadistic warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), the film spotlights how life in the wasteland can turn people into their most monstrous selves. But Furiosa’s memories of the Green Place, and its impact on how she sees the world, are part of what make her so well-suited to deal with the outside horrors.</p><p>Whereas <em>Fury Road </em>often<em> </em>felt like a gasoline and piss-soaked lucid dream punctuated with guitar riffs and the roar of flamethrowers, <em>Furiosa </em>unfolds much more like a stage play told in bookended acts that all crystalize how Furiosa became a warrior. Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris emphasize the importance of Furiosa’s perceptiveness as the film fleshes out the cast of weatherbeaten ghouls who serve Dementus. These include The History Man (George Shevtsov) and interpretive dance proclaimer Smeg (David Collins). Though none of Dementus’ goons can make sense of why the enslaved girl won’t speak, through them, she’s able to learn what it means to live among predatory strongmen who harness fear as a weapon.</p><p>It’s interesting to see more of <em>Max Max</em>’s dystopian world from the perspective of Dementus’ gang — a band of motorcycle-riding maniacs who frequently turn on one another both out of spite and necessity.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Furiosa can’t initially perceive it, there’s a distinct difference between the cultures of Dementus’ horde and that of the Citadel where Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme) rules his fanatic War Boys and enforcers like Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke). In Praetorian Jack, you can see shades of Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky, which brings a narrative poetry to the larger Furiosa story Miller has been telling with the franchise’s last two films. But from the moment Furiosa meets Dementus, you can almost immediately hear Miller and Lathouris struggling to lock in on what kind of presence they want their mad biker king to be.</p><p>Similar to Fury<em> Road</em>’s Immortan Joe before him, Dementus is another font of absurd masculinity whose cartoonish effects contrast with his bloodlust and penchant for torture. Through a face full of prosthetics that distract more than transform, Hemsworth tries to bring Dementus to life with an energy that’s meant to read as unhinged but tends to play as scatterbrained. You can see the spark of a complicated altruism in the paternal shine he takes to Browne’s haunted, adolescent Furisosa toward the beginning of the movie. But as the film brings the Biker Horde and the War Boys together in a prolonged power struggle, Dementus starts to feel more like a character stitched together from leftover ideas for Immortan Joe that didn’t make it into <em>Fury Road</em> or the 2015 <em>Mad Max </em>video game.</p><p>That feeling of Dementus being an echo of <em>Mad Max </em>villains past intensifies as the younger Immortan Joe — a more level-headed, cautious version of his <em>Fury Road </em>self — becomes a bigger part of <em>Furiosa</em>. The characters’ similarities feel like two expressions of what kind of archetypal tyrant would crave and attract power in the wake of society’s collapse. They’re both macabre brutes whose rages frequently seem to mask deep-seated insecurities about their places in the world. But <em>Furiosa</em>’s characterization of Immortan Joe and his mutilated failsons Scrotus (Josh Helman) and Erectus (Nathan Jones) does so much more to make the movie feel like an organic extension of <em>Fury Road</em> rather than a fancy new limb grafted on in response to the earlier film’s success.</p><p>Immortan Joe and his War Boys are also an important part of how <em>Furiosa</em> brings Taylor-Joy’s Imperator-to-be into the picture. And while the older Furiosa continues to say so little that she often feels like the latest example of the silent / deadly girl trope, she also becomes the focal point of some of the movie’s most impressive set pieces. <em>Furiosa</em>’s action sequences — chases through the desert and battles in places like the oil-rich Gas Town — all feel smaller in comparison to <em>Fury Road </em>in a way that actually helps the film establish its own identity.&nbsp;</p><p>The sequences’ scale and the way shots of explicit carnage are obfuscated by clouds of smoke and sand almost make it seem as if Miller’s reminding you how much more dire things become for Furiosa in the future. But the steely-eyed determination with which Taylor-Joy’s Furiosa moves through the film’s last third is mesmerizing — at least in moments when the movie just lets her be the star rather than the person who’s forced to step up when the men around her can’t quite get the job done.&nbsp;</p><p>For all of Taylor-Joy’s ability to command attention when she’s on-screen, <em>Furiosa </em>still makes its heroine feel like a supporting character in her own movie. This happens essentially right up until its final act, which comes closer to <em>Fury Road</em> than you might expect. And while the two films connect in a way that makes them work as a double feature, watching them back-to-back highlights just how much more the 2015 film gave Furiosa to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161871/yolk-heroes-a-long-tamago-pet-sim-idle-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NjYYdQ">The job of raising a hero destined to save the world is an underrated role. In video games, many of our RPG heroes come to us as fully grown adults who are old enough to handle being whatever kind of hero they need to be for the game they’re in. We don’t need to worry about bathing them, making sure they don’t poop themselves, or raising them in the right way so that they can have the right powers for whatever class of fighter they grow up to be. To be honest, I never considered the early years of the hero. That is, until I played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/"><em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em></a>.</p>
<p id="SZ3Vop">Developed by the small studio 14 Hours Productions and published by Astrolabe Games, <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> starts with a fairy. She lays an egg (in front of you) and tells you that she doesn’t want to raise it (rude!). She then gives you the egg and says that it’s up to you to raise the creature so that it can grow up to be a hero who saves the land of Faria from the Frog Lord. Thus began the biggest adventure of them all: parenthood. I named my character Beadle (like the scrawny salesman Beedle from The Legend of Zelda games), because I didn’t know what would emerge from the egg. After a brief few minutes of tending to the egg and playing a simple minigame where I protected it from the elements, a whole-ass human baby hatched from the egg — Beadle was a girl!</p>
<p id="C7Yu8p"><em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> contains all the trappings of your typical pet sim <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24145363/stardew-valley-like-idle-farming-sim-rustys-retirement">and idle game</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777555/tamagotchi-uni-killed-wore-wedding">like a Tamagotchi</a> — but then adds a whole bunch of other stuff onto that framework. On the most basic level you can tend to your Yolk Hero at the guild where they live. There, you manage your future hero’s four different status bars — energy, hunger, hygiene, and bladder — by taking actions like bathing them or sending them to use the toilet. Each task takes a set amount of time unless you decide to help your Yolk Hero by playing a simple mini game. So Beadle might take a minute and half to poop by herself, but I can shorten the amount of time it takes and lessen her constipation by button smashing my mouse. </p>

<p id="G09sd1">The game gets more complicated when it comes to the “heroes” part of it all. I can send Beadle on little adventures where she’ll fight a series of enemies with short walking breaks in between. A quest might take 30 minutes to complete, but I can step in to allow Beadle to complete the quest much more quickly by helping her fight. These quests introduce systems with a surprising amount of depth: Area 1 contains 12 different quests, during which you can level up your Yolk Hero. Player characters even develop specific skills for different classes like Monk, Ninja, Paladin, and so on. Beadle grew up to be a Samurai, which I didn’t pick but might have been influenced by the training I had her do in her child stage, so I would buy items and upgrades specifically tailored for her class to maximize her odds of success.</p>
<p id="z9WKOX">Turns out I am a bit of a helicopter parent, so I’ve been watching her fight a goose wearing a kimono to the left of my browser as I write this. If I see she’s having a tough time with a fight, I click over and give her a little boost to make sure she stays safe. That might make this game sound a bit demanding, but the greatest part of <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> is that I feel like I can put as much or as little time into it as I’d like.</p>
<p id="pu8szC">I still have memories of rushing off to the bathroom to feed my needy Tamagotchi as a child, but I don’t deal with that in <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em>. I am taking care of a budding hero. She might not be the most powerful warrior in the land, but she’s not so helpless that I need to be checking in on her all the time. </p>
<p id="nxGBRe">What’s more is that the game has settings that allow you to decide details of gameplay like whether or not you want the game to continue to run in the background when you close it or not. So if you want to turn off care for your character for the weekend when you’re away from your desk, you can. Similarly along those lines, features like the task queue allow you to line up a to-do list for your Yolk Hero. So when I left for dinner last night, I set up a little evening routine for her so she would come back with her status bars in good shape. </p>

<p id="8EATfi">Each time I log off, I feel a small pang of anxiety: Will my Yolk Hero be okay? What if she dies on her quest? I worry about my poor Beadle — but never for too long. </p>
<p id="xvBcNd">Again, that’s because <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> is an idle game that gives you a good amount of flexibility as to how much time you actually spend playing. If you want to get really into adventuring and help your Yolk Hero fight and explore, you can. If you just want to watch them bop around on the side of the screen as you work, that’s also possible. Or if you have moments where it’s just too much, you can just close the game entirely and allow your hero to work through their challenges themselves. </p>
<p id="DQlqSh">The joy of parenthood — at least, as it’s represented in the sweet little microcosm of this game — is about seeing growth, but also knowing when it’s okay to step away and let your child surprise you. </p>

<p data-characters="160" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With two versions of <em>Wuthering Wave’s</em> main character, the Rover, up for grabs at the start of the game, you might be wondering which one you should pick. </p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Many gacha games will put players in this position as they will provide a male and female version of the character, and people will always want to know if there is any advantage between one or the other. In this guide, we will break it all down for you.</p> <h2 id="h-is-there-a-difference-between-the-male-and-female-rover" data-injectable="false">Is there a difference between the male and female Rover?</h2> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">There isn’t any important difference between the male and female Rover. Their abilities and strengths are the same; they will use the same weapon and upgrade materials, and they will go through the story the same way. The Intimacy system that dictates your relationships with other characters will also remain the same, no matter what character you pick.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The difference between the male and female characters really boils down to things that can be determined by personal preference. Which character model do you prefer? Do you think the male or female voice actor is better? Do you typically just play as one or the other gender in your games? It honestly doesn’t matter. </p> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Wuthering Waves Female and Male Rover Comparison" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzqJU_nb5dI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">The only real difference between the two characters is their attack animations. I’ve embedded a comparison video above so you can have a good look at both characters as they move through their attacks. Personally, I prefer the female animations. There is just something very cool about the behind-the-back sword work that she does after some combos. </p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="false">If you are curious about the other characters and how they stack up when compared to each other, be sure to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-character-tier-list-main-dps-secondary-dps-and-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our Tier List</a> to find out who is worth chasing down and investing in for your party and who is better off for simple story missions.</p>

<p data-characters="247" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new developers discussion for <em>Genshin Impact</em> details some new quality of life updates coming in Version 4.7. The most notable change is an increase to the amount of Original Resin a player can hold. Here’s what that actually means for players.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">These changes should take place with the Version 4.7 update, which is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-roadmap-and-update-schedule-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled</a> to be on <strong>June 5, 2024.</strong> We will find out more about what’s new in Version 4.7 when the special program airs on <a href="https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1793129862229827913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 24</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-genshin-impact-s-new-resin-cap" data-injectable="false">Genshin Impact’s new Resin cap</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">With the Version 4.7 update, the total amount of Original Resin a player can hold will be <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/28920205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased</a> from 160 to 200. Since one Resin refreshes every eight minutes, this means your Resin will now cap in about 26 hours instead of the previous 21 hours.</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">If you were already logging in multiple times a day so that your Resin never reaches the cap, this change won’t affect you. However, for players who only log in once per day, they now have the ability to log in at the same time every day without losing Resin. No matter your preference, this change offers a bit more flexibility for players to play the game on their own schedule.</p> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">In <em>Genshin Impact,</em> Original Resin is the stamina currency used to earn rewards from gameplay. World bosses cost 40 Resin to claim their rewards, and most other materials cost 20 Resin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">When <em>Genshin Impact </em>first released, the Resin cap was only 120. This forced players to log in every 16 hours if they wanted to maximize their limited resources. The cap was increased to 160 Resin in November of 2020 for Version 1.1.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Images via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-other-quality-of-life-changes" data-injectable="false">Other quality of life changes</h2> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">The developers discussion also outlined some other changes coming to <em>Genshin Impact</em> with the next update.</p> <h3 id="h-increased-item-caps" data-injectable="false">Increased item caps</h3> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">The maximum number of forging ores, character EXP books, artifact EXP, and cooking ingredients will be increased. Hoarders rejoice!</p> <h3 id="h-more-friends" data-injectable="false">More friends</h3> <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">The friends list will be expanded to accommodate up to 100 friends. I’m glad HoYoverse has faith in my ability to make 100 friends.</p> <h3 id="h-recommended-artifact-stats" data-injectable="false">Recommended artifact stats</h3> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">If you’ve been using the recently added “fast equip” feature for artifacts, there will now be a custom option to fill in recommended artifact stats based on player data. If you want to quickly gear your character, it’s now as easy as clicking three buttons.</p>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">Of course, the build recommended by this feature won’t always be the most optimal available to you. It will probably be good enough to make your character usable, but for more advanced build-crafting, check out our <em>Genshin Impact</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build guides</a> for more nuanced recommendations.</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has announced that its popular action roleplaying series, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>, will be making its way to Steam for the first time ever. Currently available on PlayStation 4 , Xbox One, Nintendo Switch (cloud) and PC (via the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/epic-games-store">Epic Games Store</a>), the three following titles will make their Steam debut on June 13th, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="KINGDOM HEARTS - Steam Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5_3qdf19BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition, both HD collection and the beefed up KH3 package can be purchased in the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece bundle. If you’ve been wondering what all the fuss is about, this is the perfect gateway for any curious PC players out there.</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts made its PlayStation 2 debut way back in 2002 and has continued to grow a zealous following. It’s core concept back in the day was fascinating, fusing together multiple Disney worlds in a quest that had all the hallmarks of a JRPG classic.</p>
<p>Over the years Kingdom Hearts has expanded and mutated across multiple platforms, spinning an increasingly convoluted yarn for more than two decades. The upcoming Steam releases contain more than just the three mainline entries in the series with <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Square Enix providing a handy breakdown</a> of everything included:</p>

<h3>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</h3>
<p>This compilation contains four full games, with two additional story experiences for good measure.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS FINAL MIX</strong> – The game that started it all, remastered with HD visuals, improved controls, a reworked soundtrack, and more. This is the game that introduced us to Sora – a brave lad with big feet and a bigger heart.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Chain of Memories</strong> – Set directly after the events of the first game, Sora, Donald and Goofy enter the mysterious Castle Oblivion, and stumble into an adventure that’s forgettable in the best possible way! …That’ll make more sense when you’ve played it.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS 358/2 Days (HD Remastered Cinematics)</strong> – This story focuses on Roxas, a new character with a special connection to Sora. The compilation features cinematics from the original game, enhanced with additional text and remastered in HD.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS II FINAL MIX</strong> – The second numbered game reunites Sora, Donald and Goofy in an epic adventure across some of the most memorable and unexpected Disney worlds in the series. Like Tron – Tron’s in here!</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX</strong> – Prequel time! This game turns back the clock to before Sora ever wielded a keyblade and shifts the focus onto three new characters: Terra, Ventus and Aqua. It’s an emotional adventure with a wildly entertaining battle system – there’s a reason it’s a real fan favorite.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Coded</strong> (HD Remastered Cinematics) – This hi-tech tale takes Data Sora into the digital world to seek an answer about a cryptic message. The compilation features enhanced cinematics only.</p>
<h3>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</h3>
<p>This collection of games is a real dream for fans. It contains games that focus on some of the most popular characters in the series, Sora, Riku and Aqua, and set up the climax to the saga.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Dream Drop Distance HD</strong> – Sora and Riku take their Mark of Mastery exams to become true keyblade wielders. Things do not go as planned – if you thought your exams were stressful, you ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-</strong> – Made specifically for this collection, this episode gives you control of Aqua, following the dramatic ending of Birth by Sleep. It’s a short and sweet adventure that leads directly into KINGDOM HEARTS III.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS χ Back Cover (movie)</strong> – An HD movie that goes back in the timeline even further than Birth by Sleep. It tells the story of the Foretellers – but who are they and what will they mean for the KINGDOM HEARTS series?</p>
<h3>KINGDOM HEARTS III + Re Mind (DLC)</h3>
<p>The Dark Seeker Saga reaches its climax in KINGDOM HEARTS III. The Guardians of Light gather for the final battle against the forces of Darkness</p>
<p>Before that though, Sora must travel through a whole new set of Disney and Pixar worlds. He’ll team up with Buzz and Woody to explore a toy store, untangle a mother’s sinister plot with Rapunzel, soar across the skies of San Fransokyo with Baymax, and much more.</p>
<p>The PC version also includes the Re Mind DLC as standard. It features additional story content, some of the toughest and most exciting boss battles in the whole series, and loads of additional features, including gameplay modifiers and photo galleries.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, we imagine the Steam versions will land within the same ballpark as the Epic Game Store releases with HD 1.5+2.5 at £39.99, and the others at £49.99, all with a potential launch day discount.</p>

With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.</p>

<p>Player First Games <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">say</a> they will let anyone who played MultiVersus’ beta hop into its first season’s premium battle pass without paying a penny. That’ll also mean you’ll be able to unlock the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-smash-bros-fighter-multiversus-adds-friday-the-13ths-jason-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith-to-its-already-preposterous-roster">absolutely wedge-ified Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th</a> - the first reward on the paid pass - for free rather than paying money, too. (He’ll be offered for in-game currency and character tokens down the road if you miss him.)</p>
<p>The developers also sought to reassure folks coughing up cash for the track that they’ll get their money’s worth, by saying they’re bumped the number of “high-value” items -  ringouts, alternate characters, taunts and the in-game currency of Gleamium, a word I instantly dislike - across both the free and premium passes. In Fortnite fashion, climbing far enough up the battle pass will earn you enough Gleamium (shudder) to cover the cost of the next battle pass without investing any more real money, so you can technically pay once and then just play enough over its eight-week length to keep unlocking everything.</p>
<p>On top of the free battle pass, beta players will also get a costume for Adventure Time’s Finn the Human that sticks the lanky hero in a snug snow suit, plus a “special edition” ringout animation featuring some rising stars.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There’ll be plenty to grab for fans of, uh, anthropomorphic bananas, too, as Adventure Time’s surprise contender, the Banana Guard, will be unlockable as a playable character by working your way through a seven-day tutorial track. Completing the full week-long reward calendar will also get you Lady Banana Guard, who is exactly who you’d expect based on that name. To complete the banana offerings, players back from the open beta will be able to switch their announcer to a Banana Guard voice pack. That’s absolutely… <em>surprising</em>!</p>
<p>To grab the goods, you’ll need to log in to the returning <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play game</a> between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-year-after-ending-its-open-beta-multiversus-will-return-on-may-28th">its (re)launch date on May 28th</a> and June 11th. Based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">Ed’s time with it back in 2022</a>, MultiVersus is a fairly promising contender for a slick and entertaining Smash Bros-like on PC - no doubt doubly so if you’re a massive fan of Warner Bros IP, for some reason.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24162578/delicious-in-dungeon-kobold-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Rt8VSN">Why do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025746/delicious-in-dungeon-netflix-finally-some-good-food"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a>’s kobolds look like sexy dog people? You’re not the only one wondering.</p>
<p id="Rg1PAo">If you’ve played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> you’re probably familiar with kobolds. Introduced all the way back in Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the 1970s, the creatures look like small, bipedal dragons in the 5th edition of the tabletop RPG.</p>
<p id="ftB4UQ">But in <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, kobolds look… like dogs! So is mangaka Ryoko Kui just messing with us? Not at all.</p>
<p id="IZGU3D"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/kobold">Kobolds come from German mythology</a>, where they’re usually depicted as kind of typical goblin-y critters. They’re mischievous spirits that help or hinder around the house, depending on how annoyed they are with you.</p>
<p id="N49OvN">When Dungeons &amp; Dragons creator <a href="https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2022/01/dd-monster-spotlight-kobolds.html">Gary Gygax wrote his rulebooks in the 1970s</a>, he described kobolds as distantly related to goblins, but with “doglike voices.” Accordingly, the kobold in the original monster manual is depicted as a dog-like humanoid.</p>
<p id="VtZFra">Over the next nearly 50-odd years, Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ kobolds became more and more reptilian with each edition of the game. But in Japan, a different game hit: the computer RPG series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24146605/delicious-in-dungeon-video-game-inspirations">Wizardry</a>. <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> came out in 1981, and it was heavily inspired by D&amp;D. But its kobolds kept the dog-like features of the original D&amp;D monster manual!</p>

<p id="gbLeXj">As the years went by and more Wizardry games came out, kobolds continued to resemble humanoid wolves, while the Western tabletop counterpart grew into something more reptilian.</p>
<p id="v95bUb">Ryoko Kui has talked about how <a href="https://x.com/Gaearth/status/1758134409788822011">she grew up watching her dad play the Wizardry games</a>, and how inspired she was by the monster design. Her kobold design has a long legacy in Japan.</p>
<p id="H4IsZ1">That being said, she is perhaps the first person brave enough to make kobolds <em>hot</em>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-3-spoilers-mdfc-dual-land<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A first look at a unique cycle of lands from MTG's next set.</h2></div><div><section><p>Preview season for Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Modern Horizons 3, is in full swing, and we’ve got an exclusive look at 10 uncommon cards! This is a cycle of two-color MDFCs (modal double-faced cards), meaning you can play them either as the spell on the front side or the land on the back, with each one representing one of Magic’s color pairs. (You can preorder Modern Horizons 3 cards at <a href="https://zdcs.link/R0b5V" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.)</p><p><strong>Flip through the image gallery below to see all 10 new cards</strong>:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>MTG: 10 New Cards from Modern Horizons 3 - Double-Faced Dual Land Cycle</h3></div></output><p>This cycle of double-faced cards is rather unique compared to similar designs – Magic has had plenty of single-color MDFC lands, with a spell on one side and a land that taps for the same color on the other, but this is the first time we’ve seen dual lands like this. The spell on the front uses hybrid mana (meaning its cost can be paid with mana of either color that is shown), providing a lot of flexibility in how each card could be used.</p><p>That will likely be enough to make a few of them an appealing choice for Commander players looking to sneak more spells into their mana bases, and probably useful pick-ups when doing a booster draft for Modern Horizons 3. Of course, I’m certainly no pro, and I generally don’t play the Modern format that this set is largely designed around, so I can’t speak to the exact power level of the individual cards here without inevitably making a fool of myself.</p><p>That said, there are some clear synergies that this sort of design enables that seem worth pointing out. For example, they provide welcome support to a fun but currently fringe card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/brr/18/goblin-charbelcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Goblin Charbelcher</u></a>, which attempts to kill the opponent by using a deck that runs no cards with lands on the front face. That strategy previously had no access to dual lands to fix its mana, but now it has 10 more to choose from (though the red-green and green-blue options are likely the most relevant to it).</p><p>On top of that, it’s possible that the actual effects of these spells might not matter much when it comes to their usability. That’s because some of the most powerful cards currently played in Modern can be cast for free as long as you exile a card of a specific color from your hand. Running a blue-black dual land that can <em>also</em> be used to cast either <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/50/force-of-negation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Force of Negation</u></a> or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/87/grief" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Grief</u></a> (both Modern staples) for free could just be an appealing enough proposition on its own in the right deck.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But again, I’m no pro, and I’m sure it won’t take long for those who are to pick these cards apart and find all the best (and worst) ways to use them. For my money, I’m just glad they are at the uncommon rarity rather than anything more scarce, as I could certainly see a few of them becoming staples of budget Commander mana bases in the future.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-3-expansion-is-up-for-preorder">Modern Horizons 3 is available for pre-order now</a>. It's set to launch officially on June 14, with paper prereleases taking place starting June 7 and its digital debut on MTG Arena on June 11. </p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/TomRMarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

                <p>Footage of Deadlock, the next game reportedly in development at Valve, has leaked online, showing off gameplay of the multiplayer hero shooter in action. The new gameplay videos reveal Deadlock's training mode, several of its hero characters, and aerial lines that players will be able to ride around on, similar to the skyhook system used in BioShock: Infinite.</p><p>Described as a mix of Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2 influences, Valve-focused <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557" rel="nofollow ">content creator Gabe Follower</a> reported that the game will be a competitive third-person experience with a 6v6 format, tower defense mechanics, and it has a blend of steampunk and fantasy design influences. "Combination of Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Valorant, Smite, and Orcs Must Die," the account claimed.</p><p>"Hero design pretty much inspired by Dota universe," <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793" rel="nofollow ">Gabe Follower posted several days ago</a>. "Main map references modern steampunk European city--little bit like Half-Life. Initially game had sci-fi elements inspired by Half-Life and Portal, but after bad feedback dev team decided to focus on fantasy."</p><p>Several heroes have also been revealed, including the impish Ivy, gentleman demon Infernus, sneaky operative Haze, glass cannon Lady Geist, and pale sniper Vindicta. Interestingly, several of these characters have a "great for new players" tag, suggesting a beginner-friendly approach for newcomers. There's also a closer look at the training modes on offer in the game, giving players a chance to become familiar with the controls and gameplay of Deadlock.</p><p>If Deadlock is Valve's next game, it'll be facing some stiff competition in this market. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> have sizable audiences, while NetEase's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522324/" data-ref-id="1100-6522324">Marvel Rivals</a> also looks set to make a big splash in the competitive gaming genre when it's eventually released.</p>

Each Pack includes the following at each price point:</p> <ul data-found-items="28" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1331" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Founder’s Pack</strong> – $19.99 <ul> <li data-index="0">Game Over P90 Skin.</li> <li data-index="1">Game Over Sebastian Skin.</li> <li data-index="2">DedSec Player Card.</li> <li data-index="3">Bronze Founder’s Player Card.</li> <li data-index="4">1,000 XCoins.</li> <li data-index="5">DedSec Faction.</li> <li data-index="6">Five Weapon XP Boosters.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Founder’s Pack Elite</strong> – $39.99 <ul> <li data-index="7">Game Over P90 Skin.</li> <li data-index="8">Game Over Sebastian Skin.</li> <li data-index="9" data-injectable="true">Masquerade Singa Skin.</li>
 <li data-index="10">DedSec Player Card.</li> <li data-index="11">Bronze and Silver Founder’s Player Cards.</li> <li data-index="12">3,000 XCoins.</li> <li data-index="13">DedSec Faction.</li> <li data-index="14">10 Weapon XP Boosters.</li> <li data-index="15">Preseason Battle Pass.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Founder’s Pack Ultimate</strong> – $69.99 <ul> <li data-index="16">Game Over P90 Skin.</li> <li data-index="17">Game Over Sebastian Skin.</li> <li data-index="18">Masquerade Singa Skin.</li> <li data-index="19">DedSec Player Card.</li> <li data-index="20">Bronze, Silver, and Gold Founder’s Player Cards.</li> <li data-index="21">5,000 XCoins.</li> <li data-index="22">Anodized Rhino Skin.</li> <li data-index="23">Anodized Iselda Skin.</li> <li data-index="24">One additional Anodized skin.</li> <li data-index="25">DeadSec Faction + all four Year 1 factions when released.</li> <li data-index="26">20 Weapon and 20 Battle Pass XP Boosters.</li> <li data-index="27">Preseason Battle Pass.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">It’s important to note that if you already have the DedSec faction unlocked before purchasing, you won’t be given a bonus in trade. It’ll simply be less value in the Founder’s Pack.</p> <h2 id="h-which-founder-s-pack-is-worth-buying" data-injectable="false">Which Founder’s Pack is worth buying?</h2> <p data-characters="573" data-current-count="778" data-injectable="false">As for which Founder’s Pack you should buy, it’s suggested that you <strong>don’t go further than the Founder’s Pack Elite</strong>. While some of the perks of the Founder’s Pack Ultimate are nice, the various factions can be earned through gameplay. You’ll also still get the battle pass from the Elite tier. Otherwise, the choice between the Founder’s Pack and Founder’s Pack Elite is up to what you’re willing to spend on the game. Spend some time with the game first and see how much you plan to commit before forking over the cash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/heres-a-look-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-a-look-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="174" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Netflix YouTube channel just released a teaser that finally reveals Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt of Rivia for the upcoming fourth season of <em>The Witcher</em> TV series.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="The Witcher: Season 4 | First Look | Netflix" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kr3br-3i8TY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">The teaser only show’s Geralt’s back, his wolf school medallion, and then his bright face and yellowed eyes. Nothing about his appearance is a departure from the previous look, except for Liam’s leaner physique. Some fans might take issue with it, but the costume crew certainly won’t, as it will result in fewer costumes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-got-so-ripped-for-the-witcher-that-he/1100-6472420/">ripped apart by a Witcher that’s just too buff for them to handle.</a></p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">You could perhaps say that Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt looks more apprehensive than confident — unlike Henry Cavill’s take on the character. That might be his choice for the role, or a look imbued by reality as he knows he has big shoes to fill after Henry Cavill’s unexpected firing from the show.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">My take? Well, he pulls off the Geralt look, and certainly looks much better than Henry Cavill did in that cheap-ass wig from Netflix’s make-up test that somehow ended up as the character’s big reveal. Yes, we will <em>never</em> forget.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Make Up Test: Henry Cavill as The Witcher (2019) TV Netflix" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ET69EGN9iT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">The big question, I’m afraid, is not whether Hemsworth will look and act the part, but whether he’ll go for a new take on the character, or try to copy Cavill’s outing. Sadly, I believe fans might not be too keen on either. Still, I believe Liam Hemsworth is deserving of a chance, simply for having had the guts to take on the role.</p>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false"><em>The Witcher’s</em> fourth season still doesn’t have a release date, but you can play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em> on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and on PC.</p>

            <p>The classic anime series Gundam examines the traumatic experience of war, particularly the unalterable effect it has on those young soldiers forced to participate in the horrors of fighting for their life while taking the lives of others using weapons of inhuman strength and devastation. Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-4-maps-modes-zombies-announcement">incoming crossover</a> with Mobile Suit Gundam - as the original seventies animated series was called, before it evolved with the likes of direct follow-up Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and spin-offs such as Iron Blooded Orphans the recent (and very, very excellent) Witch from Mercury - will manifest itself as a set of Operator skins, weapons, finishing moves and other such gubbins in the next season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a>.</p>
<p>Season 4 of MW3 and Warzone will add skins based on two of the iconic mecha in the older series: the RX-78-2 piloted by Amuro Ray, equipped with its Beam Rifle and shield, and the magnificent MS-06S Zaku II controlled by long-running villain Char Aznable, complete with the axe-like Heat Hawk. A third skin will then offer up The Witch from Mercury’s XVX-016 Gundam Aerial, affectionately piloted by Suletta Mercury, and its Beam Rifle, which doubles as a glowing sword in the anime.</p>

<p>The Gundam Tracer Packs will appear sometime next month, and will only run for a certain amount of time before they vanish off to wherever Gundam Evolutions go to when they die. Alongside the full skin and weapon packs, there’ll be some extra unlockables you won’t need to pay money for, offering up the chance to nab another weapon blueprint, a weapon camo, stickers, emblems, a weapon charm, calling cards and more across Warzone and MW3.</p>
<p>What is weird about all this is that the Gundams have to be shrunk down to the size of regular humans to keep things fair - meaning matches might end up looking like a cosplay LARP as people-sized robots run around and do battle. Anyway, this press release claims that “since its debut in 1979, the Gundam franchise has centred around gifted pilots commanding technologically advanced machines into the onslaught of conflict - mirroring the challenges players face in Call of Duty”. I’ll just leave you to ponder that particular comparison.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="UTOReD">Characters like the Doof Warrior don’t come along often. The unofficial mascot of Immortan Joe’s army, and a symbol of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders">bombast</a> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>, the masked rocker with the flame-spitting guitar became an instant hit on the internet and received an immediate induction into the movie icon hall of fame. </p>
<p id="Z0Altq">The Doof Warrior is <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> in miniature. Both are combinations of seemingly disparate pieces and random parts, clearly grafted onto one another, but somehow still seamlessly organized to make something perfect and unique. The Doof Warrior is just one of <em>Fury Road</em>’s many miracles, but the story of his creation is also the perfect way to understand how the film reached the legendary status it has today. After all, why wouldn’t the coolest movie of the century so far also have the coolest character in it?</p>
<h2 id="aRwz7k"><strong>The origins of the Doof Warrior </strong></h2>
<p id="jTJT25">Like the rest of <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, Coma, the Doof Warrior, seems to have come about from the perfect intersection of a wildly ambitious, visionary filmmaker and technically excellent craftspeople. </p>
<p id="Tbsmw2">The idea, as far as anyone seems to remember it, was all director George Miller’s. In Kyle Buchanan’s book about the making of the film, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Chrome-Wild-Story/dp/0063084341?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Chrome-Wild-Story/dp/0063084341?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23925988__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925988__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>, Miller explained that the character is there to “distill the nature of <em>Fury Road</em>: Kind of wacky but rooted in some sort of reality. He was the equivalent of the drummer or the bugler, with his electric guitar.” Production designer Colin Gibson put it even more succinctly in an interview with <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/9dfq3e/mad-max-fury-road-guitar-player-doof-warrior-colin-gibson">MTV News</a> shortly after the movie’s release, saying “Uncle George, being George Miller, imagined the biggest little drummer boy in the world.”</p>

</p>
<p id="FQFGUT">With that idea in mind, Gibson said that his task, as he saw it, was to “build the largest, last <a href="https://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/marshallstack.html">Marshall stack</a> at the end of the universe.” And that meant having the apocalypse’s coolest guitar to drive those amps. </p>
<p id="xtusH7">For that, Gibson turned to salvage artist Michael Ulman, who did many of the props and vehicles for <em>Fury Road</em>. Ulman put together an incredible, sculptural guitar centered around a porcelain bedpan with a French horn at the center, and Gibson put a real working guitar somewhere in the center of it because, as he put it, “George — unfortunately — doesn’t like things that don’t work.” Thus the Doof Warrior’s incredible ax was born, a feat of engineering and art that could really play music and really shoot flames as it was driven through the desert.</p>
<p id="WJvy6S">“It is the shittest guitar I’ve ever had the misfortune to have hanging in front of me,” said iOTA, the guitarist and performer who played Coma, in Buchanan’s book. But even if the guitar wasn’t ideal to play, that didn’t seem to lessen iOTA’s enthusiasm for the role. </p>
<p id="D1yAS6">The Doof Warrior was one of the many characters that Miller created a fully fleshed-out backstory for. According to iOTA in an interview with <a href="https://movieweb.com/mad-max-4-fury-road-flamethrower-guitar-backstory/">Movie Web</a>, Miller said that Immortan Joe found Coma in a cave and had him schooled in music in order to lead his army into battle. Displaying a kind of dark creativity commensurate with the role, iOTA did Miller one better by suggesting that Coma was found in the cave clutching his mother’s decapitated head, and that Coma took her face off and wears it as his battle mask in her honor. </p>
<h2 id="sXiuYu"><strong>When the Doof Warrior took over the internet </strong></h2>
<div id="i0AwfW"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1bZYdfvmBk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WYkjnz">The Doof Warrior took the internet by storm the instant he arrived on the scene. As Cory Watson, the director of <em>Fury Road</em>’s behind-the-scenes documentary, told Buchanan, “You can’t even count the number of articles on the Doof Warrior that came out in the year or two after the film was released.” Sure, he quickly popped up in memes and gifs on Twitter and as a prime target for <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/15-fantastic-pieces-of-mad-c1432857850817.html">fanart</a>, but the way websites wrote about him was an almost perfect mirror of the film’s success. </p>
<p id="kVlKcV">While its cultural legacy may be massive now, <em>Fury Road</em> started off small at the box office, with just a $45 million opening weekend. As more people saw the movie and told everyone they could about how incredible it was, the movie became the fabled “word of mouth success,” eventually earning more than $150 million at the domestic box office and nearly $400 million worldwide. </p>
<p id="6p92Mk">Similarly, enthusiasm for the Doof Warrior started small, with critics and writers who saw the movie early <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2015/may/18/mad-max-fury-road-crazy-guitar-guy-doof-warrior-turning-it-up-to-11">writing about how cool the “guitar guy</a>” was, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/the-doof-warrior-max-max-fury-road">explainers popping up about who exactly the character was</a>. But as more and more people saw <em>Fury Road</em> and started clamoring to learn more about it, internet entertainment outlets started focusing their coverage even more and writing more and more stories.</p>
<p id="7cxfWg">Eventually, most of the stories started calling him by his rightful title, the Doof Warrior, instead of referring to him as <em>Fury Road</em>’s “guitar guy,” and the crew were happy to give reporters a peek behind the curtain. There were interviews with <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/9dfq3e/mad-max-fury-road-guitar-player-doof-warrior-colin-gibson">Gibson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrqhzZnERWA">Ulman</a>, and even <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/rkqb3m/we-talked-to-the-dude-who-plays-a-flame-throwing-guitar-in-mad-max-fury-road">iOTA himself</a>. Just like the movie, what started as an unbelievable curiosity suddenly bloomed into a cultural fascination that persists to this day: A cult hit that broke into the mainstream to become an absolute classic. </p>

<h2 id="KALGIr"><strong>The Doof Warrior still embodies Fury Road’s spirit</strong></h2>
<p id="8DzcEc">To give you an idea of how close <em>Fury Road</em> came to being a totally different movie, Miller told Buchanan in <em>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Chrome</em> that the studio tried to cut the Doof Warrior several times. <em>Fury Road</em> had several different test screenings, and at most of them the Doof Warrior only had temporary sound, so he was playing the same guitar riff every time, annoying audiences. Miller had plenty of experience keeping <em>Fury Road </em>alive despite studio attempts to shut the production down, and the Doof Warrior was no different — the biggest little drummer boy stayed in. </p>
<p id="QhgO1t">Miller knew exactly what he was doing with Coma: “What I knew and no one else knew is that his music was going to evolve, and eventually that would become part of the full orchestration of the story. Of course, by the time the film was finished, he became probably one of the most popular characters.” </p>
<p id="ffQuCf">And that’s still true to this day. The Doof Warrior is an instantly recognizable symbol of <em>Fury Road</em>. A character too cool to be in any other movie, but also one of Miller and the crew’s dozens of world-building masterstrokes that help propel <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> from a great movie to a true one-of-a-kind classic.</p>

However, some of those same people have started leaking footage of the yet-unannounced game online and the reaction has been...mixed, to say the least. </p><div data-video-id="193974" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="194" data-playlist="193974,196131,195189" data-current="193974"><div><p>The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193974/193974_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19440.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>We’ve known about <em>Deadlock </em>for years now, based on leaks and datamined information from other Valve games.

Well, based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gameplay and screenshots</a></span> from the closed alpha test, <em>Deadlock </em>will be a hero-based online third-person shooter featuring maps with MOBA-like lanes, mobs to kill, and <em>Bioshock Infinite</em>-like rails that you can grind around to get to areas quickly. </p><p>In the alpha test footage that has leaked online, it seems the game currently has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pDylan002/status/1793301907223535857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pDylan002/status/1793301907223535857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 characters</a></span>, and all of them share a similar steampunk-meets-fantasy style, similar to the rest of the game’s vibes. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Valve about <em>Deadlock</em>. </p><p>It should be noted that this build of <em>Deadlock </em>is likely still early and the game will change in looks and gameplay as it gets closer to an official launch, the reaction to leaked gameplay and screenshots of Valve’s next big thing has been fairly muted, with most fans more confused than anything else. </p><h2 id="h21841"><a id=""></a>The reaction to Valve’s next game hasn’t been great</h2><p>While I’ve spotted some folks excited to see what Valve is working on next, the majority of online chatter around <em>Deadlock </em>is focused on how “late” this game feels. The hero shooter craze has mostly died out, and the demand for another one, with MOBA-elements no less, seems lacking. The game’s generic, IP-less style and world have also confused fans who have long wanted a new <em>Half-Life</em> or <em>Portal </em>game from Valve, but are instead getting something more akin to <em>Valorant </em>meets <em>Overwatch</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to details from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>, people who have reportedly played <em>Deadlock </em>say that it plays very much like a MOBA, with creeps running around maps.

It’s also reported that a giant boss spawns in the middle of the map and can be killed for more upgrade currency. </p><figure id="" data-id="e46928f12d270ed7e528d6c0f97025f6" data-recommend-id="image://e46928f12d270ed7e528d6c0f97025f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Gordon shooting a heli with an SMG in Half-Life 2.

Valve is good at making games. And sure, that’s generally true, but keep in mind that when it comes to original, internally designed multiplayer games, well, Valve’s track record is far from great.<br></p><p>Yes, <em>DOTA 2, CSGO, </em>and <em>TF2 </em>are wonderful, but those are all games Valve inherited from outside developers and modders and then built upon and expanded.

We’ll have to wait and see how Valve reacts to this feedback and how it affects (or doesn’t affect) <em>Deadlock.</em></p><p><em>.</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kr3br-3i8TY" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.</p>

<p>Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: <em>Baptism of Fire</em>, <em>The Tower of the Swallow,</em> and <em>Lady of the Lake</em>. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and&nbsp;Freya Allan&nbsp;(Ciri).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week. Read all about it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/cdpr-working-on-free-witcher-3-mod-editor-to-allow-players-to-create-your-own">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

However, there isn’t much information about these groups, so we don’t know what abilities they will have just yet.</p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Ranked Mode will also be officially released later down the line. Currently, <em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>only presents a Trial Run version to give players a small taste.

While the current version may seemingly have this feature, it’s not accessible yet, but stay tuned for updates.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">If you want more variety in&nbsp;<em>XDefiant,</em>&nbsp;the upcoming seasons will bring forth new weapons and maps. It will make the game much less tedious once these roll out, especially if you’re gunning for another weapon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft will also improve <em>XDefiant</em> altogether by maintaining a balanced experience for all players. This mission goes along with their choice of not including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>, which has become a controversial topic in shooter games. More pushes like this will likely come up more and more to keep things fair in-game.&nbsp;</p>

You should be packing some excellent gear and be at or above level 100 to take on Echo of Andariel. But before you can even attempt it, you’re going to need how to get where she can be summoned: Hanged Man’s Hall.</p> <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false">Getting right into the meat of what you need to know, the <strong>Hanged Man’s Hall lair is found East of Tarsarak</strong> in Kehjistan. It’s not all that far. Here’s a picture:</p> <figure data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Working backwards, in order to summon the Echo of Andariel, you’re going to need <strong>two Pincushioned Dolls and two Sandscorched Shackles</strong>. Pincushioned Dolls are gained from The Beast in the Ice and Sandscorched Shackles are dropped by Lord Zir. These are endgame bosses if that isn’t already clear. You need to fight them in World Tier 4.</p> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">You’ve probably learned this, but the Pincushioned Dolls and Sanscorched Shackles you use in the summon will be consumed.</p>
 <p data-characters="125" data-current-count="125" data-injectable="false">Andariel is pretty analogous to her brother Duriel. That’s in terms of power level, but also in the loot that gets dropped.</p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="false">Also note that you can now fight Tormented versions of the bosses, if you feel prepared. These are level 200 versions that have better chances at rare loot. In order to summon the tormented version, you need <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-sygian-stone-in-diablo-4-season-4/">Stygian Stones</a>, as well as six Sandsorched Shackles and six Pincushioned Dolls. Good hunting.</p>

No settings let you remove them, and you can’t tweak anything about your install either.

<p data-characters="148" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Search and Destroy is a staple in <em>Call of Duty</em> and its competitive scene, and players may want to know if there is a similar game mode in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">Since the start of <em>Call of Duty</em>, Search and Destroy has been in every title. The goal of the game mode is for the attacking side to either eliminate the defending team, or arm and detonate one of the two bomb sites. Meanwhile, the defending team can either defuse the bomb (once planted) or take out all of the attackers. Players only have one life per round, and the first team who wins six rounds emerges victorious. Along the way, there have been a few different variations of the game mode, but the core principles have always been the same. </p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">Other FPS titles have similar game modes, leading to the question of whether or not it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-is-search-and-destroy-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Is Search and Destroy in <em>XDefiant</em>? </h2> <figure data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false"><strong>There is no Search</strong> <strong>and Destroy mode in <em>XDefiant</em> or any similar game mode</strong>.

Throughout the title’s first year, there will be four new factions, 12 weapons, 12 maps, and more modes and features. </p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft also confirmed that an official Ranked Mode will be added in a future update. With that in mind, a Search and Destroy game mode could potentially be the perfect game mode to complement the other potential offerings in a competitive setting.</p>

            <p>
A new year means a new Call of Duty, meaning Activision Blizzard is going to have to get around to unveiling it at some point. Reports are suggesting that 'some point' will almost certainly be during Microsoft's Xbox showcase this June, but before then, the first teaser has seemingly now been spotted in an unassuming corner of the internet.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, a likely new Call of Duty 2024 teaser site has emerged (thanks <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1793301871429382299">Charlie Intel</a>) at <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/">TheTruthLies.com</a>, where visitors are able to fiddle with some buttons on a TV set and watch a quick blast of mysterious footage.
</p>
<p>
Currently, only one of the TV's six channels shows footage when selected, and there's no explicit Call of Duty branding to definitively confirm the connection - but it's an easy enough leap to make given the distinctive orange logo that appears in various places around the site.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
Starting with the footage, though, it's a short jigglycam sequence - more The Blair Witch Project than Call of Duty, to be honest - that features a group of (gasp) activists scurrying through the woods at night. "This'll wake them up", somone says at one point, and we eventually see the results of their scheming when the footage cuts to daylight - revealing Mount Rushmore's four presidential faces now festooned with blindfolds and adorned with the words, "The truth lies".

Incidentally, the site's metadata has a longer version of that slogan, reading, "You might remember a better time. But it was false. Trust no one. Open your eyes. Find the truth."
</p>
<p>
It's the big orange logo squirted across Abraham Lincoln's noggin (and used as the site's favicon) that ties things together, of course; it's the same logo - a three headed dog - Microsoft previously used to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">tease the mystery Direct event</a> that'll immediately follow its Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday, 9th June. Last year, it was reported Call of Duty 2024 was being developed by Treyarch under the codename Cerebrus, so there's your link.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, we might know a fair bit about Call of Duty 2024 already. A report last November claimed it would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">Black Ops title set in the Gulf War</a> and featuring 'traditional combat technology' - one supposedly attempting "explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict."
</p>
<p>
More details will likely arrive on 9th June, and we can seemingly expect at least five more TheTruthLies.com teases ahead of then. There's no hint of a release date for Call of Duty 2024 yet - beyond claims of a "late fall, early winter" launch - but whenever it shows up, it'll reportedly be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">day-one title on Game Pass</a>.

            <p>We already know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cat-and-mouse-creation-of-hunt-showdown-and-why-there-may-never-be-a-hunt-2">a full-blown sequel</a> to swampy extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-will-never-replace-hunt-showdown-with-hunt-2-the-way-overwatch-2-did-overwatch-1">probably isn’t on the cards right now</a>, but developers Crytek appear to be lining up the next major update for the 2019 PvPvE cryptid-slayer as almost a whole new game regardless.</p>

<p>The upcoming update due to drop this summer - August 15th specifically, as confirmed in a new developer diary - will bring the half-decade-old FPS over onto the shiny CryEngine 5.11 engine, with all the visual polish, performance improvements and overall whizz-bangery that allows for.  Helping to showcase the new engine will be the first new map and biome in over three years, but we don’t know what that’ll look like or where it’ll be set just yet.</p>
<p>While the underlying gameplay will remain the same, general manager David Fifield said that the update is big enough to be considered “a significant relaunch of Hunt: Showdown at a whole new level”, adding that it will kickstart a “whole new era of Hunt”.</p>
<p>Part of that era, for what it’s worth, will be a fairly literal generation change, as away from PC the engine update means that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players will no longer receive official support (but will be able to carry over all their stuff to the new version for free when they do upgrade) - which might have at least some knock-on effect for those playing cross-platform on PC.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Fifield highlighted the new user interface and the systems for recruiting hunters and earning prestige as among those that will “continue to evolve”, with the developers also taking a closer look at hunter revival, health chunks, restorations and the ability to burn downed hunters, as well as aiming to reduce match stalemates in favour of “more definitive fights”.</p>
<p>There’ll also be some separate tweaks behind the scenes to things like matchmaking and servers, joining a step up in efforts to tackle cheaters and other “exploitive play”, aiming to improve the overall multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>Crytek plans to tease out more details in a series of weekly updates between now and August, before the major update lands on the 15th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24160969/outbreak-refined-switch-locations-legend-difficulty-path<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="l2rXdh">“<strong>Outbreak Refined</strong>” is a bonus quest in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>’s reprised “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24155578/zero-hour-walkthrough-outbreak-perfected-exotic-pattern">Zero Hour</a>” mission, which will allow you to unlock new perks for you to further customize your<strong> Outbreak Perfected</strong> Exotic Pulse rifle. To get these new perks, you’ll need to flip some hidden <strong>switches</strong> in the legend version of the mission each week. You can pick up “Outbreak Refined” from Ada-1 after you’ve completed “Zero Hour” for her once before.</p>
<p id="8fGt4X">In this <em>Destiny 2</em> guide, we’ll walk you through how to complete the legend version of “Zero Hour” and finish the “Outbreak Refined” quest. If you need to upgrade the Intrinsic perk for Outbreak Perfected and pick up the new Vimana Junker Exotic ship, check out our guide on the “Zero Hour” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23925011">vault puzzle</a>.</p>
<p id="4UJqjH"><strong>Note</strong>: Only two of the three Outbreak Refined quests are available at the time of this writing. The final quest will become available on May 28, and we’ll update this guide to reflect the new switch locations.</p>

<hr id="8gjIbp">
<h2 id="jXpWbl"><strong>How to complete ‘Zero Hour’ on legend</strong></h2>
<p id="nBmNAL">Before I tell you where to find the switches, first you need to know how to complete “Zero Hour” on legend. Unlike “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24124313/whisper-walkthrough-worm-exotic-pattern">The Whisper</a>” mission, the route you’ll take in “Zero Hour” changes based on the difficulty, so you’ll need to learn a partially different path if you want to complete this quest.</p>
<p id="8sZJGj">Start up “Zero Hour” on legend mode and get ready to run. While the normal version of this mission gives you 40 minutes, on legend you only get 20, and have to fight against more difficult combatants.</p>

<p id="Msgw2T">The first part of the mission plays out the same on both legend and normal, so proceed through the quest until you’ve killed all the Fallen, dropped down the elevator, and reached the room where you normally jump down to the ship on the bottom left. But this time, do not jump down. Instead, turn right.</p>
<p id="7j0OOl">You’ll see a group of air vents shaped like an E on the room. Run over to it and make your way to the top right vent. On the back side of the vent, you’ll see an open pathway. Take it. </p>

<p id="i6uzS3">Now you’ll be in a bit of a pipe maze, and there are switches on the wall for you to throw. These switches correspond to the concrete lids. The lid you need to open is three, and you’ll find the switch for it in the back left of this maze. Run forward, jump up to the scaffolding on your left, and then jump down to the left again, so you land diagonally from where you entered this area. Go down the path and flip the switch. </p>
<p id="6pI6Zt">Return to the concrete lids and climb on top of number three — don’t go in it. Use the lid as a jumping point to climb up the drain. At the top, take a left and head into the open vent on top of the boxes. Follow the path until you get to a big pit. Carefully jump into the cubbies here and kill the Fallen in your way. Jump from doorway to doorway until you can exit on the left side of the room, near the Captain. (If you throw the switch here, you’ll make this room much easier for your friends.)</p>

<p id="ggqoiA">Follow the path until you reach outside the Tower. Take a left and look for the very small footholds along the wall. Climb the pipes and be careful of the small metal platforms, as they’ll collapse after a few seconds of standing on them. Round the corner of the Tower and keep going. Climb up to the open vent and be careful of the exploding shanks inside. </p>
<p id="PYGl5y">Take a right and slide down the chute. Make sure to jump at the end so you don’t fall into the pit. From here, jump into the pipe room on your right and then climb the pipes up to a landing. From there, look left and shoot out the vent. You’ll now be in the fan room, which is where the points converge.</p>
<p id="CqirNw">Follow the normal route here until you reach the Cryptarch’s vault. Now you’ll need to know the secret vault path to stop yourself from being incinerated. Like on normal difficulty, this path changes every day, and is based on the burn for the mission (which you can check by opening your Ghost). </p>

<p id="DB9efC">Once you know your way through legend “Zero Hour,” finding these hidden switches is fairly simple. </p>
<p id="47j8kJ">After you’ve killed enough Fallen with Outbreak Perfected to advance the “<strong>Outbreak Refined 1</strong>” quest, head into legend “Zero Hour” and make your way to the <strong>concrete lids</strong> — the ones labeled one through four. Flip the three switch like normal. But this time, on your way back, stop by the scaffolding in the center of the pipe maze. On the sides of the room, you’ll see what looks like two big air conditioners. Above one of them, you’ll see a switch. Flip it and you’ll get a countdown on your screen that says “<strong>Catalyst Switch Primed</strong>” and then a short countdown.</p>

<p id="iTIETs">Run as fast as you can up to the number three lid and climb all the way to the top. Go through the doorway and turn left. Next to the shelf, you’ll see a switch on the wall. Flip it before your timer hits zero and you’ll finish this part of the quest. If the timer is a little too quick for you, have no fear, as you can do this route backward as well, and it’s actually a bit easier. Simply throw the switch next to the shelf, jump down the hole, and make your way back to the air conditioner switch.</p>
<p id="DmLsy9">Once you’ve successfully thrown the switches, you need to complete “Zero Hour” on legend. If you’ve already wasted too much time on the switches, you can restart the mission and you’ll stay on the same step — no need to do the switch puzzle again.</p>
<p id="vsKoo6">When you finish the mission on legend, you’ll be able to take the quest back to Ada-1, who will give you the <strong>Rapid Hit</strong> perk that you can now use to customize your Outbreak Perfected.</p>

Here’s what I’ve found so far when it comes to shaping Senua into the perfect warrior against the forces of darkness.</p><h2 id="h23817"><a id=""></a>You can put the combat on auto-pilot</h2><p>If you’re just here for the narrative and puzzle solving, you can either radically simplify the combat or put it entirely on auto-pilot, letting Senua do all the attacking and dodging on her own. Navigate to Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Accessibility and under Actions you’ll see Default, Simplified, and Self-play for both Offensive and Defensive actions, meaning you can either automate Senua’s attacks or her defenses, or both. <br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857">How To Make The Most Of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s Graphics On PC</a></span></p><p>This is a great way to simplify the game so you can focus on the story, OR to see the combat in action without your input.</p><h2 id="h23818"><a id=""></a>Blocking and parrying basics</h2><p>In <em>Hellblade II</em>, you want to be very active in blocking (as well as evading). Combat in this game is very much about paying attention to each individual opportunity to strike or prevent a strike—especially on the higher difficulties.</p><p>Holding RB/Ctrl will see Senua block attacks. This allows you to withstand most normal blows fairly well, but enemies have a few tricks up their sleeves and can find ways to break Senua’s stance. One example is when an enemy’s weapon glows red before they strike: While you can still block such an attack, it will knock you off balance, leaving you open. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-recommend-id="image://e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-recommend-id="image://e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, if you block mere moments (and by moments, I mean milliseconds; the window to time this is incredibly small) before a strike hits, Senua will instead parry her enemy’s attack, which can leave them open for a fatal finisher from her. This includes the more powerful attacks where an enemy’s weapon glows red.</p><h2 id="h23819"><a id=""></a>Evading is as essential as blocking</h2><p>If you press A/Spacebar, Senua will take a step back. If you move and press A/spacebar, Senua will duck and move in the direction of your analog stick (or WASD input). This is the best way to deal with an enemy’s heavy attack (when their weapon glows red). You can also put some distance between you and a foe by holding back and hitting the evade button/key.</p><h2 id="h23820"><a id=""></a>You can cancel attacks by evading and blocking</h2><p>Canceling attacks is pretty important to the general flow of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s combat. Senua is perhaps most vulnerable while she’s in an attack animation that hasn’t yet landed its blow. Good news: blocking and evading cancels out an attack animation.</p><figure id="" data-id="8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-recommend-id="image://8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Note how Senua blocks in the middle of a heavy strike, which results in a perfect parry.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-recommend-id="image://8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is perhaps most important for heavy attacks. When an enemy is in a block stance (or using a shield), fast attacks won’t do a whole lot. You’ll need to land a heavy attack, the wind-up of which is rather slow. If you’re trying to land a heavy attack but see that an enemy is about to hit you before Senua finishes her attack animation, simply evade with a directional input and a press of A or spacebar and you’ll cancel out the heavy attack. You can also block with RB/Ctrl and cancel out attacks. (It’s hard to know for sure, but I seem to pull off successful parries more often by canceling out an attack with a block, so perhaps the parry window changes during a cancel).</p><p>You can also cancel out fast attacks (X/Left mouse button), but these are usually so swift that you won’t need to worry about it. Still, it’s worth keeping in mind.</p><h2 id="h23821"><a id=""></a>Mash evade to get up or use Focus</h2><p>If an enemy gets the better of you and knocks you to the ground, you have two ways to get back up. You can either mash the evade button (A/spacebar) or activate your Focus ability to get up quicker.</p><h2 id="h23822"><a id=""></a>Evasion is the key to fire-breathers</h2><figure id="" data-id="f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-recommend-id="image://f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-recommend-id="image://f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fire-breathing enemies are a bit of a pain in <em>Saga</em> as you can’t block flames. Instead, you’ll have to evade their bursts of fire with a directional input + the evade button/key. Fire-breathers attack to their left and right as well as to the front. The latter is the most disorienting as the camera doesn’t make it obvious how to steer clear. In general, moving back with directional input combined with Evade is the best way to avoid the flames.</p><h2 id="h23823"><a id=""></a>You can sprint in combat too</h2><p>If you’re trying to close the distance between Senua and the enemy quickly, sprinting will help. Holding LB or Shift while moving in combat will see Senua sprint forward. If you hit the attack button while sprinting during Senua’s Focus ability (RT/E), Senua will perform a leaping attack.</p><figure id="" data-id="7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-recommend-id="image://7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Focus + Sprint + Attack results in a leaping strike.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-recommend-id="image://7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h23824"><a id=""></a>Don’t waste Senua’s Focus ability</h2><p>Senua has a focus ability which slows down time and allows her to execute a number of rapid slashes. You’ll charge this ability by attacking, taking damage, and executing perfect parries.</p><p>But Focus isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card for Senua. It is possible, particularly during the more challenging brawls, to miss your attacks while using this ability and you can also still be struck depending on an enemy’s stance. Also, if you activate it at a distance, make sure you’re sprinting forward to land a leaping attack on your enemy.</p><h2 id="h23825"><a id=""></a><em>Senua’s Saga</em> combat difficulty options explained</h2><p>In Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Combat Difficulty, you’ll find four options which you can change at any time (including during fights). Just how Dynamic adjusts the difficulty is hard to discern for certain, but easy, normal, and hard seem to influence how many hits Senua can take before she’s knocked to the ground, where an enemy can easily execute a coup d’état. Based on my research (which I did by allowing the first enemy in the Draugar Fight to attack me), Senua would get sent to her downed state after the following number of attacks: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Easy</strong>: five strikes<br><strong>Normal</strong>: four strikes<br><strong>Hard</strong>: three strikes</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to tell exactly how difficulty affects the strength of Senua’s attacks. Without standard HUD elements like health bars and floaty numbers all over the place, we don’t have anything concrete to go on. That said, after running through the “Draugar Battle” a few times on different difficulties, I do feel like Senua’s able to chew through enemies a little faster on the easier difficulties <br></p><h2 id="h23826"><a id=""></a>Where to practice combat</h2><figure id="" data-id="ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-recommend-id="image://ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-recommend-id="image://ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As soon as you start making progress in <em>Hellblade II</em>, you’ll gain access to chapter selection. This is a great way to practice <em>Hellblade II</em>’s combat for subsequent runs on hard mode if you so desire. After you rescue Fargrimr, you’ll have access to the “Draugar Battle” sequence which features about four to five minutes of fighting. You can skip the cutscene at the start of this sequence by pausing and selecting “Skip Cinematic” (let the scene play out just a second or two for this option to pop in the pause menu if it’s not there). </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677"><em>Hellblade II</em> Studio Reportedly Already Working On Its Next Game</a></span></p><p>Starting from a specific chapter won’t override your current playthrough accessed by selecting “Continue” in the game’s main menu <em>unless</em> you play past the point where you last left off. So if you’ve played through chapters one through four, and go back to play chapter two, you won’t override your playthrough unless you progress through chapter four and on to chapter five.<br></p><hr><p><em>Hellblade II</em> is a game of mood and tone more than anything else. While it doesn’t contain long lists of combo moves or upgradable abilities and weapons, the combat is still very rewarding and energizing to play through once you get the hang of it. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, while the Loot Reborn overhaul made Aspects permanent unlocks, applying them to new gear can still cost a lot in addition to the usual fees associated with repairs and rerolling items at the Occultist. But the biggest culprit has been post-campaign masterworking, a new system for slowly leveling up the stat affixes on a piece of gear.</p><p>Only available at World Tier 4, each new rank costs additional crafting resources and a ton of gold.

It was creating a huge bottleneck as players farmed the new Pit of the Artificer boss rush mode for crafting materials, only to find themselves short on gold.</p><p>“While we continue to review the gold economy there is one change we felt we needed to make right away,” associate game director Joseph Piepiora <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JPiepiora/status/1792315402716094907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JPiepiora/status/1792315402716094907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> over the weekend.

Currently, you can get about 1 billion gold for around $25. That’s a nearly seven-fold increase from what gold was selling for just before season 4 went live. Some players have used this as evidence that <em>Diablo IV</em>’s current gold economy is still out of whack, while others argue that the action-RPG’s progression design shouldn’t be influenced by the illicit activities of high-end players.</p><p>Despite the recent massive gold cost nerfs, it sounds like Blizzard is still looking for other ways to give players a break. “Team made a change this weekend but we may turn some additional levers on this and a few other mat items players have noted to us,” global community manager Adam Fletcher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/too-much-gold-sinks-and-not-enough-gold/160911/118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/too-much-gold-sinks-and-not-enough-gold/160911/118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on the Blizzard forum yesterday.

<p>You can only unlock these rewards by participating in Grahm’s Meat Cook, which requires playing Primal Cuts to acquire Prime Meat. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-most-meat-week-rewards">How to Unlock the Most Meat Week Rewards</h2>



<p>To unlock the most possible rewards from Grahm’s Meat Cook during Meat Week, you must keep the meter during the event as high as possible. There are three ticks on the meter; the first indicates bad performance, the second indicates good performance, and the third indicates the best performance possible. You want to ensure the meter remains above the third tick.</p>



<p>To do this, complete the optional objectives, focus on the main objectives, and work as a team. </p>



<p>The stages of Grahm’s Meat Cook include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wait for the event to start.</li>



<li>Help Grahm keep the camp clean, feed guests, and ensure the mood remains festive.</li>



<li>Extinguish bushfires (Optional)</li>



<li>Scoop Stinky Piles (Optional)</li>



<li>Clean Rotten Leftovers (Optional)</li>
</ul>



<p>Again, you’ll want to prioritize all objectives, even the optional, to ensure the best performance!</p>

<p>Will we find you participating for the Fallout 76 Meat Week rewards? You’ll bet Insider Gaming is there for the festivities. But in the meantime, check out what else we’re publishing daily:</p>

"We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Jorjani added: "The goal of the studio is to make really great co-op games. We really want to turn Arrowhead into a flagship studio, where people who want to make these kind-of games say to themselves: ‘I want to work at Arrowhead.’ When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that.”</p><p>Arrowhead will inevitably grow in size after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">Helldivers 2 sold 12 million copies in 12 weeks</a> to become the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time. However, Pilestedt and Jorjani insisted Arrowhead wants to focus on “measured growth”, and has no plans to go public.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next FromSoftware or Blizzard.</p></div><p>“We don’t run the business for monetary gain,” Pilestedt said. “The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist."<br>Meanwhile, Arrowhead has sald Helldivers 2's success <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-its-seen-a-horrifying-amount-of-threats-and-rude-behavior-from-some-in-the-community">has brought with it a huge amount of toxicity to deal with</a> even as it works to add more content to the game's live service. To that end, Arrowhead has indicated it plans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">to take more time with patches in order to get them right</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And why wouldn't it? After the stratospheric success of the LEGO game franchise and its countless crossovers with huge franchises, the Funko Pop toy folks following the same path could prove to be an incredibly smart move. </p><p>And make no mistake: Funko Fusion is definitely bringing the pop-culture franchise thunder. IGN recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/funko-fusion-announces-release-date-and-names-jurassic-world-back-to-the-future-and-other-ips-appearing-in-game">revealed</a> its September 13 release date along with the news that over 20 famous franchises would be joining the Funko party, including Jurassic World, Back to the Future, Masters of the Universe, JAWS, Shaun of the Dead, Chucky, The Thing, Battlestar Galactica, Umbrella Academy, The Walking Dead, Invincible, and many more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With less than four months to go until it's in players' hands, IGN's metrics suggest that gamers are paying close attention to this one. To wit:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Funko Fusion has over 3.2 million views on our TikTok account.</li><li>It's amassed over 600k views on our YouTube channel (over just two videos so far)</li><li>On Instagram, it's talled over 1.5 million views</li><li>And on Facebook (yes, <em>Facebook</em>!) it's hit nearly 1 million views.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Funko Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>We're looking forward to our first chance to play Funko Fusion, which should happen sooner rather than later. In the meantime, look out for some new exclusive gameplay at IGN Live, our upcoming in-person (and livestreamed) event next month (<a href="https://www.ign.com/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get tickets here</a>).
