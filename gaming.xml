<p>One thing that's quietly slipped by, however, is the reveal of a brand-new suit for our protagonist Samus Aran. As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/NinWire/status/1989347451074171162">Nintendo Wire</a> in the below post, the suit can be seen in a short clip posted on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/troopers/index.html">official Japanese website</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, it's got a similar vibe to Samus' new red suit, but there are also some clear similarities to the <a href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Suit">Light Suit</a> seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>What do you think? We wonder what kind of properties these new suits will take on. Will they grant new abilities? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Previews have now gone live for Prime 4, including our own. It seems many folks aren't too keen on the new Galactic Federation Troopers accompanying Samus on her journey, but otherwise, this definitely looks and feels like a new Prime game. Heck yeah.</p>

            <p>Most of the attention on Rockstar post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">second delay</a> has, rightly, been focused on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">their abrupt firing of 31 employees</a>, for which the IWGB have accused the company of union busting.</p>
<p>As all of that happens, though, the video game making machine continues to churn on, and GTA Online's continuing to get the additions Take-Two said it would when they set this latest delay in stone. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s online element/cash cow guise has long been a playground where regular people like you or me can live out a still somewhat satire-tinged take on the fantasy lifestyles of uber-rich criminals, so it honestly feels a bit strange that it's taken this long for Rockstar to add in mansions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the latest <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3921419k23a552/lay-a-proper-foundation-in-new-listings">Rockstar Newswire post</a>, those big houses are coming in an update this December. At this point, I'd ask that you briefly return your eyes to this article's strapline. There are almost certainly a few suitable living or at least sleeping places a GTA Online character can own at this point that I've left out of that list.</p>
<p>The game's economy, its prices for new additions hyperinflated to compensate for years of heist and business grinding from more dedicated players and the truckloads of real money spent by others, has long been an almost accidentally perfect parody of the real world.</p><p>Now, after years of living in cookie-cutter batchelor pads or tacky penthouses, its biggest whales are set to make the next step you would in real life. Buying a massive house to fill with monuments to your own glory, so you can live in the sort of cartoony decadence historically reserved for monarchs, major religious figures, robber barons, and investment bankers. No one in GTA Online needs a mansion. I'm fairly sure many who buy them will soon abandon setting foot in them, in favour of sleeping under the desk at a business or just not pretending to sleep at all. I remain unsure if this is just human nature or mastefully purposeful satire GTA Online players will play into.</p>
<p>If you jump into GTA Online this month, you can do three new missions for the folks who'll be selling the mansions. These new missions, dubbed "New Listings", involve clearing out squatters, finding construction materials, and motivating contractors. Doing all three will net you a discount of $2 million on your mansion. To put that in context, the <a href="https://www.gtabase.com/grand-theft-auto-v/properties/gta-online/the-orion-yacht">least swanky yacht</a> the game has to offer will cost you $6 million. Some <a href="https://www.gtabase.com/grand-theft-auto-v/properties/gta-online/darnell-bros-warehouse">business warehouses</a> go for more than $3 million. There's no indication of how much the mansions will cost yet, but I'm quite keen to find out, because I think I'll end up rolling on the floor laughing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/since-rolling-out-this-black-friday-deal-on-blink-video-doorbell-52-off-amazon-sold-10k-units.1354036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a video doorbell might not sound like the most exciting gift, but it’s one of those practical purchases that ends up being useful for home security. Amazon already <strong>dropped Black Friday prices on its own products</strong> ahead of the official sales rush which explains why Blink cameras and doorbells are sitting at record lows right now.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/">Blink video doorbell just hit $28 instead of its usual $59 price tag</a>, which makes it an incredibly affordable way to monitor your front door. This doorbell delivers <strong>head-to-toe HD video, infrared night vision, and up to two years of battery life</strong> on three AA batteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Blink video doorbell operates off of<strong> three included AA Energizer lithium batteries for up to two years</strong>&nbsp;which means you aren’t climbing ladders every few months to swap out dead cells. Extended battery life comes in the form of efficient power management that will only activate recording after motion gets detected or someone pushes the doorbell button. You can <strong>install this unit completely wire-free</strong> with the included mounting kit in just minutes; no electrical knowledge is required. And if you prefer a wired setup, you can hook it into your existing doorbell wiring.</p>



<h2>HD Video and Night Vision</h2>
<p>It <strong>captures a full head-to-toe view of anyone at your door</strong>&nbsp;which makes a much bigger difference than one would think. Cheaper doorbells usually cut off at chest level and don’t show packages on the ground or clearly show faces. The expanded field of view lets you see where delivery drivers place boxes, identify visitors before opening the door, or monitor your entire doorstep area within one frame. <strong>HD video quality remains clear during the day, and infrared night vision automatically kicks in when the light starts to fall</strong>. You can actually make out faces and read package labels at night instead of just some blurry shapes moving around.</p>
<p>Two-way audio lets you communicate with whoever’s at your door through the Blink app on your phone: You hear them clearly, and they hear you respond in real time. That proves incredibly handy when you’re not home but need to give delivery instructions, tell a friend where the spare key is or let a visitor know you’ll be there in a few minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon includes a free 30-day trial of the Blink Subscription Plan</strong>, which stores your video clips securely in the cloud and adds person detection. That way, you avoid most of the false alerts from cars, animals, or trees that may be moving in the wind, only to receive notifications if an actual human were to approach your door.</p>
<p>The <strong>doorbell supports Alexa-enabled devices</strong> so you can see who’s at your door from any of your Echo Show or Fire TV devices. You can ask Alexa to show your front door camera, arm or disarm your system, or get notifications on your smart speakers about activity at your door. This should come as no surprise as Amazon owns both Blink and Alexa, after all-and the two systems interact seamlessly with no need for elaborate setup routines.</p>
<p>At $28, this doorbell costs less than dinner for two while providing real security value for your home. The deal is live on Amazon right now, and considering how quickly these early Black Friday prices tend to sell out, grabbing one sooner rather than later probably makes sense.</p>

<p>Chief among these is the “blink” system, which lets you warp instantly from point to point in a way that reminds me now of the similar nausea-preventing movement systems seen in many virtual reality games. Here, being able to go from one hidden corner to another without the risk of being seen revolutionizes the stealth gameplay.</p>
<p>Hopping up to a nearby rooftop or down on top of an unaware enemy with a quick blink is incredibly satisfying, making you feel less like a crawling assassin and more like a bona fide superhero. The same goes for the “dark vision” that lets you see enemies and allies through walls, an ability that’s all the more necessary in a game without any sort of mini-map to help you get the lie of the land.</p>

<p>In contrast to the elegant, super-powered sneaking, combat in <em>Dishonored</em> can feel a bit slow and clunky. This is exacerbated by the game’s “chaos system,” which sends seemingly endless waves of enemies that turn each violent engagement into a war of attrition against a nearly overwhelming force.</p>
<p>It’s usually a better idea to simply blink away to safety until they quickly call off the pursuit. Or, better yet, just avoid combat altogether by sticking to the shadows, coming out only when you can take out your next assassination target cleanly and silently.</p>
<p>In a lesser game, the assassination-focused gameplay could threaten to feel too repetitive. But <em>Dishonored</em>‘s structure encourages different paths to that same final goal in each mission, from magically assisted sneaking to social manipulation and eavesdropping to actually taking a moral stand in a long-running feud.</p>
<p>Add in side quests that offer plenty of opportunity for creative problem solving, and you have a game that encourages multiple playthroughs to explore all the different ways you can succeed. That should provide enough of an excuse to revisit <em>Dishonored</em>, or to dive in for the first time if you missed it during its debut.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/digital-foundry-covers-the-disappointing-tech-in-pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-covers-the-disappointing-tech-in-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1354000/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Our pals over at <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-a-massive-cross-gen-gap">Digital Foundry</a> have provided their verdict on the recently-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Switch and Switch 2, covering the tech utilised and the performance gap between the two consoles.</p>
<p>Looking at the visuals in the sole location of Lumiose City, Digital Foundry states that the execution is rough around the edges, looking "garish" even on the Switch 2. One particular highlight is the fact that the majority of NPCs found on your travels are motionless; rooted the spot in set locations (and yes, we've also covered this in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-creepiest-entry-yet-not-in-a-good-way">previous feature piece</a>).</p>
<p>Both versions feature copious pop-in, while many of the pedestrians also pop-<em>out</em> when you move closer to them. On a positive note, however, Switch 2 features a lot more detail in the environments, with sharper textures in general. However, the repeated flat texture maps for the buildings' windows and balconies is called out as being a huge negative, with pixelated visuals when you get close up.</p>
<p>Switch 2's biggest upgrade comes with its overall image quality. It utilises DLSS upscaling to bring the resolution up to a 1440p target while docked and 1080p in handheld mode, and the difference between the two consoles is night and day. Meanwhile, frame rate for the Switch targets 30fps, but often drops down into the 20s when panning the camera around. The Switch 2, meanwhile, is locked at 60fps with only very rare drops.</p>
<p>Pretty much what we'd expected, then, but it's lovely to get a proper breakdown from the tech experts over at Digital Foundry. You can check out their full verdict and more over on their brand new website.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-out-and-it%E2%80%99s-immediately-being-called-out-for-being-filled-with-ai-slop.1353997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is officially out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. If you pre-loaded the game, you can jump in right now and start your journey with the latest release in the annual shooter mega-franchise, seeing everything this year's entry has to offer. Which, players have immediately noticed, also includes a slew of AI-generated slop used for in-game rewards.</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've seen Activision use generative AI for assets within Call of Duty. It did so <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">in 2023 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">in 2024 for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, with both instances facing severe backlash from players. So we can't really be surprised that there's AI slop stuffed into Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but what is surprising is just how much of it fills the game.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988982194916999619">Kumesicles on X (formerly Twitter)</a> shared an image of the in-game calling card rewards that all feature AI-generated assets, with their post becoming the lightning rod that is drawing plenty of attention, but it's not the only example of AI assets in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Activision also used AI-generated assets within the campaign, and for the prestige icons that players grind hours to attain. It's also likely that there are more AI assets to be found, though at the time of this writing and considering that the game only released today, these examples are the ones that have caught players' eyes and ire the most.</p>



<p>The replies to Kumesicles' post are a quick look at how players feel about the game being stuffed with AI slop for these assets, even if they are a small part of the game. Another look is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash">the game's Steam page</a>, where several player reviews are also criticizing the use of AI slop, on top of other issues with the game, like how the campaign cannot be paused, is always online, and will kick you from a level if you go AFK, forcing you to restart it.</p>



<p>At some point, you really have to wonder what you're paying for here. Cosmetic changes for your character and your profile in games make good goals for players to reach and good microtransactions because they were, historically, carefully crafted by artists to look cool, so that when you saw it, you wanted to grind the hours it would take to earn those small calling cards and profile pins, to have them on your profile as a badge of your own gaming prowess.</p>



<p>Of course, that's not the whole Call of Duty experience, but having a cool-looking profile that flashes when you get the winning kill of a match or make the best play in a round is an ingrained aspect of the quintessential Call of Duty experience. Why should you be getting less than what you got in previous games? It's not like Activision can't pay artists to make something that players might actually want to have on their profiles.</p>



<p>It may be a small element of the game, but it's a big showcase of just how much Activision does not care about getting the details right. So long as Call of Duty remains the commercial juggernaut it's been for over a decade, Activision will continue to degrade its quality to see how much it can get away with ripping players off. Even if Activision backtracks and replaces these assets with art actually made by humans, we have no reason not to expect the same rigamarole next year, likely even more egregious than what we're seeing now.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders could end up being one of the sleeper hits of 2025 for Nintendo, and if you’re a Switch or Switch 2 user eager to know if everyone’s small, round, pink cutie is coming to old-gen or current-gen hardware, you’ve raced into the right place.</p>



<p>Since day one, the differentiation between games, hardware, updates, and other issues has been unclear for the Nintendo Switch and its Switch 2 successor. It’s like this will continue for several years yet. This is where we come in to tell you which pit lane you need to go to for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>



<p>The spiritual successor to 2003’s Kirby Air Riders has a lot of competition to catch up.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Kirby Air Riders On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>

<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders is most definitely launching on the Nintendo Switch 2 when its November 20 release date finally arrives.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2 has had a decent amount of exclusives in its first year. Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and the upcoming Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are system-selling starlets. But Nintendo isn’t content with this, which is why we’re getting another exclusive—and another racer at that.</p>



<p>You could say Kirby Air Riders isn’t the type of game everyone has been crying out for, but we won’t say no. It should provide competition and another option to Nintendo racing fans. The main thing that wasn’t in doubt was the game releasing on the Nintendo Switch 2, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1">Can You Play Kirby Air Riders On Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<p><strong>You can’t buy and play Kirby Air Riders on the OG Nintendo Switch, making it a Switch 2 exclusive.</strong></p>



<p>A Switch 2 port was never in doubt, but the original Nintendo Switch was touch-and-go. We’re already sensing a theme with big-time Nintendo exclusives—Metroid Prime 4 aside. The old-gen hardware has served its purpose and attracted well over 150 million buyers. Now, the race is on for Switch 2 to surpass the device it succeeded.</p>



<p>How do you do this? By restricting the availability of shiny new Nintendo titles. Kirby Air Riders is only coming to Nintendo Switch 2, which means if you’re keen to ride the airy waves, you need to make a Kirby-sized jump to the Switch 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-kirby-air-riders-on-any-other-platform">Is Kirby Air Riders On Any Other Platform?</h2>



<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders isn’t coming to PlayStation, Xbox, or PC; it’s only available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>We thought we’d address this question quickly, especially in this day and age of exclusives and first-party titles flying here, there, and everywhere. Kirby Air Riders is coming to Switch 2 and nothing else.</p>



<p>Are you excited for Kirby Air Riders? Can it be a force in the kart-racing genre, battling Mario Kart, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and others? You know what to do: Go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let us know what you think of the game and if it has potential.</p>

<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p>Wordle can only be played on the New York Times website. There is currently no app for you to download the official game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-dying-light-hellrunners%E2%80%94the-zombie-game-that-never-made-it.1353982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light fans have been enjoying The Beast since mid-September, and thanks to updates made by Techland, it’s proving to be a gift that keeps on giving. In case you’re uninitiated with The Beast, the game effectively sets up the next generation of Dying Light, an open-world zombie slasher title that has existed since 2015.</p>



<p>However, not <strong>every Dying Light game </strong>ever concocted has made it to the market. In 2015, the Techland team released Dying Light, then in 2022 came Dying Light 2: Stay Human. But between those games sat a whole array of concept titles, and one in particular would have been a total genre pivot for fans of the relatively new franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-hellrunners-laid-to-rest">Dying Light: Hellrunners Laid to Rest</h2>



<p>Between 2016 and 2017, the team at Techland was busy innovating in the Dying Light space, and one title that came out of the creative minds of those at the firm was Dying Light: Hellrunners.</p>



<p>Hellrunners would have been a ‘runner’; a game that typically uses procedural generation or a never-ending loop to permit the player to, you guessed it, <strong>run forever</strong>. As the player traverses an endless pathway, they’re faced with obstacles to repeatedly overcome while securing points, coins, tokens, or something else entirely.</p>



<p>However, Techland was quick to point out that the endless approach was just one angle, and that the team was also trying out a ‘level-based’ approach.</p>



<p>Think of a game like Canabalt, a horizontally-scrolling endless runner, but add in nicer graphics, is what I was told. Then, throw in the undead and some parkour mechanics, and you’re probably close to picturing Dying Light: Hellrunners.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Canabalt is a side-scrolling endless runner with a single-button input that kept players engaged by demanding them to dodge obstacles</figcaption></figure>







<p>I caught up with Techland’s Tymon Smektala, Franchise Director, to learn more about Hellrunners and why the game never saw the light of day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We experimented with a runner DL game but after some prototypes realized that there’s not much we can do to make it stand out or innovate within the genre.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that, Hellrunners was shelved, never to be revisited, and the team moved on to piece together Dying Light 2: Stay Human.</p>



<p>Being a Dying Light fan, I was curious to learn if there were any relations between ‘Hellrunners’ and ‘Nightrunners’, the faction that exists within Villedor in Dying Light 2: Stay Human.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There was no connection between Hellrunners and Nightrunners – Nightrunners were conceptualized later in the production of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, long when Hellrunners was altogether scrapped.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s easy to imagine Dying Light: Hellrunners as a pretty gnarly mobile game. Runners are still pretty popular today, but they’re mostly hyper-casual experiences that offer little in the way of gameplay depth and are mostly time-killer titles.</p>



<p>I could just picture Dying Light: Hellrunners, though. I can imagine obstacles being items to vault or leap over, gaps that need to be crossed with a well-timed grapple hook, and undead lumbering in your path that need to be struck down as you run, all while you collect UV bars, coins, or vials of Antizin.</p>



<p>Do you wish Dying Light: Hellrunners had been made in the end? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

The game includes a full co-op campaign and mission collectibles to hunt down.

This is designed as a co-op campaign for up to four players, but it can be experienced solo, as well. This cooperative design has removed Call of Duty's feature of allowing you to choose the difficulty you play the campaign. Instead, difficulty scales based on how many players are in your party. However, playing solo isn't necessarily the easier route, and it might take a bit longer to complete alone.</p>

                <p>Once you've gone on enough raids and worked your way through some quests, you can eventually gain access to Stella Montis, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map. While you're exploring this new map, you'll want to make sure you're working on Lance's quest In My Image, which tasks you with finding and looting three androids in Stella Montis. And about that--we have some good news and bad news we'll dive into further down.</p><p>Before heading in, be aware that you don't need to extract from Stella Montis to complete In My Image, so you can always bring in a free loadout if you just want to navigate this labyrinthine map in search of androids. By doing so, you'll eliminate any major loss of resources if you find yourself in a bad situation and don't get out.</p><p>When you're ready to set off, here's how to complete In My Image.</p><h2>Where to find androids for the In My Image quest</h2><p>Though Androids can be found on other maps, you'll need to specifically find Androids on the Stella Montis map to complete this quest. They look like the same androids that you may have encountered on the lower levels of Blue Gate, but only the ones in Stella Montis can actually be looted. Well, some of them, anyway. Remember when we said we had some good news and bad news?</p><p>The bad news is that <strong>there is no specific spot on the map dedicated to finding androids</strong>, meaning you'll just need to explore the map thoroughly to come across random locations where these inactive robotic humanoids are leaned against walls or splayed out on the floor. Additionally, not every android you come across in Stella Montis can be looted. Some are static and can't be interacted with at all, which means you'll need to keep an eye out specifically for those that have a little icon show up over their bodies indicating that you can loot them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602569" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602569"></a><figcaption>Loot three androids to complete In My Image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>But there's some good news, too. Androids aren't that rare in Stella Montis. You may need to walk around for a while checking rooms and hallways, but with enough time (and a sharp eye), you'll almost certainly come across enough of them to complete the quest within a run or two. Make sure you're checking corners and other areas that aren't in your direct line of sight, as the androids can sometimes be sitting in spots you wouldn't expect.</p><p>Once you've found and looted three androids, you will complete In My Image and be ready to return to Lance in Speranza. Head to one of the Stella Montis extraction points while being careful to avoid other raiders and the Shredder enemies roaming the area, then make your way back to continue to the next quest.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Valve Talks The Next Steam Deck | GameSpot News</p>
      </div>
<p>"Obviously, the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck," Griffais explained. "The thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product."</p><p>In Griffais' summation, Valve doesn't just want a better battery in the Steam Deck 2--though that would be a welcome improvement, considering it was a point of contention in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">GameSpot's Steam Deck review</a>. Instead, the company wants something more substantial, an upgrade that makes the new handheld worthy of being a Steam Deck successor. To get there, the available Systems on a Chip (SoC) need to catch up to Valve's ambitions.</p><p>"We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life," Griffais continued. "We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck."</p><p>This lines up with what Griffais has previously said regarding Valve building a Steam Deck 2. Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge in September 2023</a>, Griffais explained that the company is waiting for a "significant enough increase" in performance technology, suggesting an upgraded Steam Deck may not arrive until 2026. </p><p>"We also don't want more performance to come at a significant cost to power efficiency and battery life," Griffais said at the time. "I don’t anticipate such a leap to be possible in the next couple of years, but we’re still closely monitoring innovations in architectures and fabrication processes to see where things are going there."</p><p>Released in February 2022, the company launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-release-better-screen-battery-life/1100-6519051/" data-ref-id="1100-6519051">a revised Steam Deck in November 2023</a> that retained the same performance as the original model but included an OLED display. This Steam Deck 2 sounds like it'll be a much more powerful device, so long as the technology Valve hopes for comes to fruition.</p><p>While a Steam Deck 2 may be a little ways away, the company's imminent hardware lineup is coming out soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">The Steam Controller, Steam Frame, and Steam Machine</a> are all shipping in early 2026, and while we don't know the prices just yet, hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">affordability is a key concern</a> for Valve.</p>

            <p>With the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, eager fans have criticised Activision for its in-game calling cards seemingly created using generative AI.</p>
<p>The calling cards in question belong to the 'Jack of All Trades' campaign challenges, as well as two specific calling cards in the 'Embrace the Nightmare' campaign endgame challenges. These cards appear, in the eyes of members of the Call of Duty community, similar to AI Studio Ghibli recreations which have been circulating online for the past few months.</p>
<p>Activision has declared AI was used during the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/">the game's Steam page</a>. The mandatory disclaimer notes: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets." While the disclaimer does not specify which assets have been made using AI, players are speculating these calling cards are a clear example.</p>

<p>These calling cards have circulated online, both <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541">on social media</a> as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/so_these_calling_cards_are_definitely_ai/">the game's Reddit page</a>. The reaction is mixed, with some enraged at the apparent use of AI in a full price video game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/comment/nosyn0q/?context=3">Take user Commercial_Pirate501</a>, who wrote: "It cost 96 dollars in my country and more than 130 dollars for vault edition lol. I personally enjoy this game, but this is [a] ridiculous amount of money for a game with tons of AI generated content."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I havent really looked at the Multiplayer and Zombie calling cards as closely and im willing to bet they're using ai on those too but its only the Campaign and endgame calling cards that are this type of blatant Sora/Grok artstyle <a href="https://t.co/5qmEXhoQkJ">pic.twitter.com/5qmEXhoQkJ</a></p>— Kume (@Kumesicles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kumesicles/status/1989327996126126344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Another user on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/comment/nos0szi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Loqh9 summerised their thoughts more succinctly</a>, writing: "Damn that's awful fuck this".</p>
<p>Alternatively, others are uncaring of possible AI use. For example you have <a href="https://x.com/MEFestof1l/status/1989342779005362572">M3Festof1l on X</a>, who commented: "This looks normal. I don't give a shit who or what created the image as long as it looks normal." These are of course just a few opinions in what is a wider debate both on AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and game development as a whole.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Activision to determine whether these calling cards and others were created using generative AI.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella stated "Microsoft is Thriving" after the company laid off 9,000 employees in a double-down on AI</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft formerly acquired Activision Blizzard in late 2023</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Valve believes the new Steam Machine can succeed where the first models failed, and according to two senior engineers, the reason is simple: the software finally caught up, leading to a wider game catalogue.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Yazan Aldehayyat stated that one of the reasons the original Steam Machines failed was the lack of software, as very few games were compatible with SteamOS (based on Linux), and only a few games could run well using other compatibility tools like Wine.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier," </em>Aldehayyat said. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows.</em>"</p>



<p>Pierre-Loup Griffais echoes the sentiment, saying that the small game catalogue was the reason the older Steam Machines failed, highlighting that many of the features of the new Steam Machine, such as the ease of use that's closer to a console than a PC, were already there. And with the system seeing limited adoption, developers had no incentive to develop Linux ports of their games. The work done on Proton since the launch of the Steam Deck has now ensured the new Steam Machine will have a big game catalogue from launch.</p>



<p>SteamOS has also been improved a lot since the launch of the original Steam Machine, and plenty of performance optimization work has been done on the operating system to improve the Steam Deck performance. For the new system, Valve has done <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff,"</em> and now, it is expected that the same performance advantages introduced on Steam Deck over time after its launch with work on SteamOS will be available on the new Steam Machine as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-with-good-software-optimization-the-new-steam-machine-could-punch-well-above-its-specs">With Good Software Optimization, the new Steam Machine Could Punch Well Above Its Specs</h2>



<p>The new Valve system won't be a powerhouse exactly. Its official technical specifications, revealed earlier this week, which you can find below, position the system between the Xbox Series S and the PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (front)<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed (back)<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (back)</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6 Cores /12 Threads<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 Compute Units<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models, both with a high-speed microSD slot:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Although the new Steam Machine is expected to run games at 4K@60Hz, early tests suggest some games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, may struggle to hit these performance targets. The system, however, is still far from launch, and with further improvements to its software side, the new Steam Machine could deliver better performance than in its current pre-release state, although the 8 GB of VRAM is definitely a limiting factor, and will be even more so in the future.</p>



<p>And if the new Steam Machine becomes as popular as the Steam Deck, it wouldn't be surprising to see either presets dedicated to the machine or even Steam Machine native builds that deliver better performance, as we have seen with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-native-steam-deck-build-performance/">Cronos: The New Dawn native builds.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-price-will-determine-the-steam-machine-s-success">Price Will Determine the Steam Machine's Success</h2>



<p>With the game catalogue issue of the original Steam Machines solved, it will likely be the price that determines the success of the Steam Machine. Valve is well aware of this, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Yazan Aldehayyat confirmed it will be very competitive</a>. How much it will be remains to be seen, as the cost of the system when <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">it launches early next year</a> has yet to be confirmed.</p>

Cicadamata" - yes the rogue apostrophes are part of the official title, yes I will exclude them in future because they make my thalamus itch - is one of those games that makes me incandescently sorry I didn't spend the past 20 years studying graphics design so that I could, for example, tell you what exactly is going on with that icecream bar HUD, those landscapes of bright diodes and cubes sliding through checkerboard obelisks, those twirling android digits, that wrist-rolling Muji paperweight of a shotgun.

<p>
The best I can do is defensively blurt words like "stylish" and "stylised" and fish desperately into my decreasing pocketful of "Cool" pop and gaming precedents and trends. This looks like... a frantic arena <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set inside the menu of a classic WipEout game? Like, er, a playable vaporwave album? I feel like we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-cant-stop-trying-to-go-faster-in-neon-white-even-with-a-record-time">invoked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-normal-is-a-psx-era-nightmare">vaporwave</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/broken-reality-out-now-with-demo">a lot</a> on here, and need to start identifying subgenres of vapors and waves. Look, why don't you watch the trailer while I try to nail down a gloss. Usefully for my dignity, you will not be able to read the words below the video embed because your eyes will have popped out of your skull.

<p>
Hello again! Assuming you still have connected retinas, I have some updates: people on the socials have been comparing Cicadamata to nu-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, and it seems the developer, flowergarden, is <a href="https://x.com/onaeire/status/1989042466876485726">some kind of fan</a>. I can certainly see a little of the upcoming Bungie game's art direction in there, though thankfully, none of its extraction-shooteriness. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3817250/CICADAMATA/">the Steam page</a> explains, this is a mix of platformer, shooter and speedrunning game in which you "hop, skip, and jump to become one with joyeuse, until you are no longer you". At the risk of blunting the hyperactive swagger of that Steam page, it looks like you play some kind of robot rabbit, Fawn-A2, and you'll be "tearing flesh from bone" in "15+ freeform levels across 6 spheres".
</p><p>
Hang on, robot rabbits! I know what this reminds me of: Jumping Flash! All those downward-looking ground-slams in the trailer are a dead ringer for the 1995 PS1 game, as are the chirrupy whoops and bops of the kill and platforming effects. Robbit wasn't this lethal, though - it's like he's been modded into Ultrakill. Cicadamata is out in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Slow internet speeds aren’t just frustrating. They can affect everything from your work to late-night streaming sessions. If you’re done dealing with dead zones and calls dropping off mid-sentence, you need a solid mesh Wi-Fi system.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5582/">The TP-Link Deco BE25 WiFi 7 is a great option to consider, and right now, its 3-pack system is going for $200 on Amazon.</a> You’re saving $70 on a solution that delivers the speeds you’re actually paying for, in every corner of your house. It’s an early Black Friday offer, which means it is most likely going to wrap up soon, before the actual event begins. Grab it for less while the discount is still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5582/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stable Connection for All Your Devices</h2>
<p>This 3-pack setup offers coverage up to 6,600 sq. ft. The 4 high-gain antennas and 4 high-power FEMs are capable of supporting over 150 devices without compromising performance, which means you can connect all your essentials – smartphone, laptop, PC, gaming console, tablet, and more – without experiencing lags or slowdowns.</p>
<p>As for the speed, the Deco BE25 taps into Wi-Fi 7 with a 4-stream dual-band setup that reaches up to 5 Gbps combined; that’s 4,324 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on 2.4GHz. Those on a multi-gig service will finally be able to take full advantage of their internet plan with exceptional, ultra-fast speeds. It’s actually the kind of performance that makes a lot of difference while working on resource-intensive creative projects or playing some cutting-edge online games. Multiple 4K streams or back-to-back video calls won’t be a problem either. Each unit also comes with two 2.5G WAN/LAN ports, which you can use for high-performance wired connections.</p>



<p>Deco Mesh works by creating a unified network with a single network name and then uses AI-Roaming technology for optimal speeds throughout your property. You can move around your house without manually switching between networks, as your devices will automatically stay connected to the fastest node.</p>
<p>You’ll also have access to TP-Link’s HomeShield platform, which offers a bunch of free security features like network security scans, IoT device identification, parental controls, and quality of service tools.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fresh previews just dropped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-release-date-motorcycle-open-world-2000625308"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, that big Nintendo holiday blockbuster we still haven’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-trailer-nintendo-switch-release-date-2000641104">gotten a dedicated Direct for</a>, and they document a troubling discovery. At least for the game’s opening areas, the stoic bounty hunter Samus Aran isn’t alone. Instead, she’s accompanied by what is reportedly a very annoying Galactic Federation trooper named Myles MacKenzie. A new trailer reveals he’s not the game’s only sidekick, either.</p> <p>“Oh wow! Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. What a mess. You’re alone, on a planet, with no hope of survival. But, you’re also not sitting next to Phil anymore in that cubicle…So…Win?” That’s apparently how Myles introduces himself in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, according to a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview"><em>IGN</em> preview</a>. <em>Metroid</em> fans are used to quiet, creepy adventures investigating strange mysteries on alien planets. The last thing most of us want is an NPC constantly babbling nonsense in our ears.</p>

 <p>But it sounds like that’s exactly what Myles does, at least in the early part of the game. He sounds full of cringe-y, MCU-style quips and the most obvious tips, like telling you to use missiles to damage armored enemies. “I was in complete disbelief at how Myles was <em>constantly&nbsp;</em>talking during gameplay, to the point where I dug around the settings menu to see if I could tone it down,” <em>IGN</em>‘s Logan Plant writes. “The only option I found was to mute voice acting entirely…”</p>

 <p>Not good! Potentially even worse, Myles isn’t alone either. A new trailer today revealed even more trooper companions:</p>  <p>The overview introduces three additional humans Samus will come into contact with, seemingly in different parts of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s world. With previews stating that the game features four main biomes forking off of the central desert hub area, this heavily implies that Samus will be working with one of the stranded troopers in each of the different areas.</p>

 <p>“Like Samus, some Galactic Federation troopers were also transported to Viewros,” we learn from the new trailer. “Follow distress signals to help the troopers, and occasionally battle alongside them. They can provide useful upgrades. Teamwork is key if any of you hope to escape the planet alive.”</p>

 <p>Will they all be as chatty annoying as Myles apparently is? Hopefully not. It’s still a major red flag, though.</p> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/so-far-metroid-prime-4-doesnt-feel-like-metroid-at-all/"><em>VGC</em>‘s Andy Robinson</a> was equally critical of<em> Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s opening hours, finding an escort mission that required him to defend Myles particularly off-putting. “By itself, these feel like pretty uninteresting mechanics,” he wrote. “But inside a <em>Metroid</em> game, it feels particularly disappointing.<em> Beyond</em>’s opening section felt like a solid, if predictable, <em>Prime</em> game drenched in a puddle of gameplay and narrative tropes, each sabotaging what makes the franchise beloved by fans. <em>Metroid</em> games are essentially sci-fi horror, but so far, <em>Beyond</em> feels like <em>Indiana Jones</em> – and not the good ones, either.”</p>

 <p>You don’t have to be a diehard <em>Metroid</em> fan to be turned off by overly yappy NPCs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-atreus-hints-puzzles-suljic-ps4-ps5-1850300067"><em>God of War</em>‘s Atreus</a> constantly interrupting quiet moments with unwanted hints was one of the bigger knocks against <em>Ragnarök</em> until an option was later patched in to make his suggestions less frequent. Even when the writing isn’t annoying, I still get tired of NPCs constantly talking to fill the lulls between action. Just because nothing is happening in the game doesn’t mean nothing is happening for me as the player.</p> <p>We’ll find out if it’s as big of a drag in the rest of <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> once it’s out on December 4</a>. And if it is, well, I hope Retro Studios is already working on a way to patch in an option to cut Myles’ mic.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-always-lose-your-stuff-these-apple-airtags-are-now-practically-free-on-amazon-2000644338</link>

              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or backpack happens to the best of us and Apple just made the solution super affordable. The company kicked off a serious Black Friday sale on AirTags, dropping prices to record lows we have never seen on these trackers before. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">four-pack now sits at $64 instead of the usual $99</a>, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">a single AirTag costs just $18 down from $29</a>. What really makes this deal great is that <strong>AirTags now cost less than the main competitors</strong> like Samsung and Tile, despite offering significantly more reliable tracking thanks to Apple’s massive network of devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 1x AirTag at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 4x AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>AirTags work by tapping into the <em>Find My</em> network, which includes <strong>hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world</strong>. When you misplace something with an AirTag attached, nearby iPhones, iPads, and Macs anonymously relay its location back to you without those device owners even knowing. This network density gives AirTags a serious advantage over rival trackers that rely on smaller user bases. You get precise location data in crowded areas where Apple devices are everywhere, from airports and shopping centers to coffee shops and office buildings. The <strong>whole system works completely anonymously and securely</strong>&nbsp;so your location data remains private while still helping you find your lost items.</p>



<h2>Precision Finding That Works</h2>
<p>Setting up an AirTag takes all of ten seconds with your iPhone or iPad: you pull the tab to turn it on, hold it near your device and it automatically pairs with one tap. You assign it to something, such as keys or a backpack, and it immediately shows up in the Find My app alongside your other Apple devices. It’s a completely frictionless process compared to trackers that require separate apps and fiddly Bluetooth pairing routines.</p>
<p>Precision Finding leverages Ultra Wideband technology to take you directly to your AirTag when nearby. On-screen directions on your iPhone feature distance and arrow indicators, almost like a game of hot and cold, that take you straight to your lost item. This works incredibly well in your home or office when something slides between couch cushions or ends up buried under a pile of papers. You can also <strong>let the AirTag play a sound to help locate it by ear</strong>&nbsp;which proves useful when Precision Finding narrows it down but you still need that final audio cue.</p>



<p>And if someone actually does lose something far from home, the<em> Find My</em> network keeps working in the background. When any Apple device comes near your lost AirTag, it securely and anonymously updates the location in your<em> Find My</em> app. You’ll get a notification showing you exactly where to find it on a map. The system even works when your AirTag is in Lost Mode, which lets you add contact information so someone who finds your item can reach you directly.</p>
<p>AirTags are built for <strong>real-world conditions with IP67 water and dust resistance</strong>. Attach them to a gym bag, drop them into a travel backpack, or clip them to your dog’s collar; rain and dirt aren’t going to ruin them. They’re small enough to slip into a wallet’s card slot or attach to your keychain without adding bulk. Apple designed them to be durable and practical for everyday use, not fragile gadgets you need to baby.</p>
<p>That means the $64 four-pack provides coverage for your most important items at only $16 per tracker, cheaper than buying four single AirTags separately, even at the discounted $18 price. You can tag your keys, wallet, backpack, and car keys all at once, creating a complete tracking system for everything you regularly misplace. The peace of mind from knowing you can locate your essentials in seconds pays for itself the first time you avoid being late because you couldn’t find your keys.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NCSoft’s and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers is not the only multiplayer game on the horizon; Guerrilla Games has something cooking in this space as well. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Horizon Steel Frontiers is a new MMORPG that was revealed yesterday. It is launching for PC and mobile devices, but we do not have a release date yet. Also, a new interview recently revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-developers-used-ai-extensively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI was used ‘extensively</a>‘ in the development process of the upcoming multiplayer game. </p>







<h2 id="h-guerrilla-s-horizon-multiplayer-title-is-their-next-big-project">Guerrilla’s Horizon Multiplayer Title is their ‘Next Big Project’</h2>



<p>The clarification about Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer title came through a post by Jason Schreier on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>. Schreir stated, “Just to clear up some confusion I’ve seen,’ Horizon Steel Frontiers’ from NCSoft is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that’s in development at Guerrilla Games.” Schreier added that Guerrilla Games’ upcoming Horizon multiplayer title is their “next big project”. He also thinks that NCSoft’s MMO is “meant for Asian markets”. </p>



<p>The Horizon franchise has been in the news a lot lately. Earlier this year, it was all about Sony’s Horizon clone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit against Tencent</a> for the latter’s upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Then the focus shifted to NCSoft and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers, which dropped an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN-NNgWIyIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10-minute video</a> revealing some gameplay and other elements of the title. And now, we have been informed that another Horizon multiplayer game is on the way; it seems the series fans have a lot to look forward to in the coming years. </p>







<p>In other news, court documents have revealed that the Horizon Zero Dawn movie is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-movie-planned-to-release-in-2027-court-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned to release in 2027</a>. Additionally, Tencent recently responded to the lawsuit, stating, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fame doesn’t create a trademark</a>.” What are your thoughts on another Horizon multiplayer game being worked on by Guerrilla Games?

And now, a new trailer published by Nintendo shows Samus will also interact with a wider cast of human characters throughout the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In IGN's just-published <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hands-on preview</a>, we described Galactic Federation trooper Myles MacKenzie — who Samus gets lumbered with for a lengthy chunk of the game's opening area — as "mildly annoying to downright infuriating" with "cringey" dialogue and contstant chattering through gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Myles, three other human troopers are highlighted in Nintendo's new 7-minute Overview Trailer (which feels as close as we're going to get to a dedicated Direct) seemingly from later sections in the game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond is structured with four major areas accessible via its desert hub (a forest area where you meet Myles, then an electrical power plant, frozen research center, and firey volcano area). The suggestion is that Samus will meet more of the main quartet in each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Like Samus, some Galactic Federation troopers were also transported to Viewros," the trailer states. "Follow distress signals to help the troopers, and occasionally battle alongside them. They can provide useful upgrades. Teamwork is key if any of you hope to escape the planet alive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A montage then shows the other troopers in action, chatting away about getting back to their families, donning a mech suit to smash a wall for Samus, and even prising open a door. Huh — couldn't Samus have just done that with a new suit upgrade?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Metroid games have featured other human characters before — even while Samus is typically a silent protagonist. But the real concern here, beyond it interrupting the core solitary exploration of most Metroid adventures, is that the human characters on offer in Beyond are simply too distracting, and too unlikable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we discovered in our hands-on preview, gameplay with Myles features escort-style sections and moments where you need to defend the hapless trooper while he hides behind the rock. Allow him to perish in a firefight and you're given the chance to revive him using Samus' psychic powers. Fail to do so (or try and refuse) and you get a Game Over screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of all the things Metroid Prime 4 could’ve been, I never would’ve guessed it would include outdated escort missions with a companion that never stops talking," we wrote.

GTA 6, of course, is expected to have a gargantuan debut, with one firm modeling sales of 40 million and revenue of $3 billion in the first year alone. Van Dreunen concurs that GTA 6 will be a massive launch, but said people are overly optimistic if they think GTA 6 is a magic bullet.</p><p>"After the high comes the hangover," he said.

It won't."</p><p>When GTA 6 comes out, gamers and investors alike with "enjoy their respective highs," but the painful comedown may come next.</p><p>"I expect a period of sobriety to follow. In the absence of any similar releases in the near future especially investors are likely to redeploy their capital elsewhere, thereby lowering the industry's overall valuation," he said.</p><p>The video game industry has faced cuts and setbacks in recent years, including a spate of mass layoffs, price increases, and numerous game cancellations.</p><p>People like former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">saying time and again that the AAA scene is unsustainable.</a> In 2012, Assassin's Creed III director Alex Hutchinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pursuit-of-aaa-is-a-cancerous-growth-ac3-dev/1100-6365381/" data-ref-id="1100-6365381">the pursuit of AAA games represents a "cancerous growth." </a>Because of this, Hutchinson said he expects AAA games to die out. "I think that will leave the AAA blockbusters as nothing more than the last of the dinosaurs," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 is set for release in November 2026 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, following a delay from May 2026.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Activision and developer Treyarch have an official excuse for people who want to blow off work to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 today. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-the-replacer-is-becoming-a-playable-operator-in-black-ops-6/1100-6527638/">The Replacer</a>, a fictional character portrayed by Peter Stormare, has written a sick note for players to give to their bosses, while jokingly adding that he will step in and boost productivity.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1989324006709707185" rel="nofollow ">official Call of Duty account on X</a> provided the sick-note template as Black Ops 7 launches today on PC and consoles. However, students are apparently out of luck, as the letter only addresses employers and not principals nor teachers. It also feels as if a parody on asking AI, like ChatGPT, to craft an excuse is missing here.</p><p dir="ltr">The sick note for a popular game release is nothing new. In fact, almost a decade ago, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skip-work-or-school-to-play-fallout-4-with-this-to/1100-6432097/">a fake doctor's memo created for Fallout 4</a>. In 2019, developer Respawn posted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawns-sick-note-for-star-wars-fallen-order-play/1100-6471480/">a silly droid note for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order players</a>. Meanwhile, last year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-replacer-has-come-to-replace-your-favorite-memes/1100-6527319/">Replacer came to replace your favorite memes</a>, with Stormare even doing<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condescending_Wonka" rel="nofollow "> the Condescending Wonka meme</a>. Stormare first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaIhm01aIY4">brought the character to life for Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 in 2013</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you do skip work or school today, be forewarned that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-cant-pause-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-so-you-better-hold-it-in/1100-6536212/"> Black Ops 7 doesn't let you pause the campaign</a>. That means if someone calls to check up on you, they might hear explosions and gunfire in the background. In addition, Treyarch has<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-aim-assist-changes-are-inspiring-lots-of-debate-and-discussion/1100-6536208/"> tweaked aim assist with Black Ops 7</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign review</a>.</p>
