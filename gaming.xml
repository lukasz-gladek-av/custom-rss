            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-june-28th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a week of change in the gaming industry. Unfortunately, we've seen yet more layoffs and studio closures this week, but this week has also yielded a major acquisition, a newly-unionized studio, and some contract alterations from big companies.</p>
<p>Here's what's been happening on the business side of the gaming industry this week!</p>
<h2>More layoffs and closures</h2>
<p>It wouldn't be a gaming business roundup without layoffs and closures, or so it seems. This year's layoff total has, after all, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns">already beaten last year's</a>, and there are still six months of the year to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/second-wave-challengers-gaming-business.jpg?itok=Fav98LJN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/second-wave-challengers-gaming-business.jpg?itok=epjsg1Rm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Challengers, we hardly knew ye.</figcaption></figure><p>This week sadly saw Korean studio Challengers <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/second-wave-developer-folds-after-missing-wage-payments-and-amassing-1-7m-in-debt#close-modal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">closing</a>&nbsp;after building up $1.7 million in debt. CEO Koji Tamura said the studio hadn't managed to attract enough publisher or player interest for its projects to continue.</p>
<p>On the layoffs side, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-of-mass-layoffs-at-gameloft-toronto" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported this week</a> that Gameloft had laid off "the majority" of its Toronto studio, a report that Gameloft itself later confirmed to the publication.</p>
<p>Chinese news platform The Paper, meanwhile, reported (according to machine translation) that&nbsp;<em>Tower of Fantasy&nbsp;</em>developer Perfect World has supposedly been <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27838848" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit by large-scale layoffs</a> across multiple departments. Those layoffs remain unconfirmed at time of writing.</p>
<h2>Cygames' parent company buys&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>dev Nitroplus</h2>
<p>Nitroplus, the studio known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fate/Zero</em>, was <a href="https://x.com/nitroplus_staff/status/1805851928569544964" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bought this week</a> by Cygames parent company CyberAgent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steinsgate-nitroplus-gaming-business.jpg?itok=fhagyoPu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steinsgate-nitroplus-gaming-business.jpg?itok=ZrysPhRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Original&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>co-developer Nitroplus has been bought up by Cygames' parent company.</figcaption></figure><p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nitroplus-to-be-acquired-by-cygames-parent-and-resume-work-on-games-abandoned-due-to-lack-of-resources/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional reporting by Automaton Media</a>, a PR <a href="https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/way/list/detail/id=30416" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> accompanying the announcement of the purchase reveals that CyberAgent will be helping Nitroplus to "pursue projects it had abandoned due to a lack of resources".</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what those projects might be, but if you're a fan of Nitroplus' visual novels, it's a happy day for you.</p>
<h2>People Can Fly and Square Enix reach new&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>agreement</h2>
<p>Square Enix and People Can Fly reached a new agreement this week regarding the ongoing development of upcoming title&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>(almost certainly not its final name).</p>
<p>The project ran into trouble earlier this year when around 30 employees were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs">apparently laid off from the project</a>, with a further 20 being moved from&nbsp;<em>Gemini&nbsp;</em>to other People Can Fly projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/people-can-fly-bulletstorm.jpg?itok=3GOd27Z1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/people-can-fly-bulletstorm.jpg?itok=g2tIYDRe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bulletstorm</em>&nbsp;dev People Can Fly has worked out a new approach for&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>with Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>The new contract appears to stipulate a more stripped-back development model for&nbsp;<em>Gemini</em>; it states that "future revenues" obtained by People Can Fly for&nbsp;<em>Gemini&nbsp;</em>will "only cover the direct costs" incurred for development.</p>
<h2>Another ZeniMax studio unionizes</h2>
<p>The unstoppable march of gaming unionization (hopefully) continues, as another ZeniMax studio revealed its intention to unionize earlier this week.</p>
<p>Bethesda's Montreal branch <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced a few days ago</a>&nbsp;that it has filed for certification with Quebec's Labor Board "with the intention of unionizing" and joining with the wider Communications Workers of America union.</p>
<p>The studio says its union is intended to make Bethesda "a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent" and that its "seat at the table" will ensure job security for employees, as well as promoting transparency, accountability, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>SAG-AFTRA announces new indie contract tier</h2>
<p>Media union SAG-AFTRA announced this week that it will introduce a new tier for its Independent Interactive Media Agreement, with a new budget range now being included in the agreement.</p>
<p>As reported <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-announces-fourth-tier-to-new-indie-dev-contract" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, projects with budgets between $15 million and $30 million will now benefit from SAG-AFTRA's union protection, as well as "provisions against AI" and access to unionized performers.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, SAG-AFTRA found itself the subject of heavy criticism after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-announces-groundbreaking-agreement-with-ai-voice-company-and-it-isnt-even">signing a controversial agreement</a> with AI voice company Replica, an agreement on which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/actors-union-sag-aftra-doubles-down-on-controversial-ai-voice-agreement-but-silences">later doubled down</a>&nbsp;to the consternation of many.</p>
<h2>SNK opens a new Singapore location</h2>
<p><em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>studio SNK has <a href="https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/us/press/2024/062801/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opened up a new location in Singapore</a>, which was technically established in 2022 but which was officially unveiled earlier today.</p>
<p>SNK says its new studio marks a "significant milestone" in its mission to create "high-quality games", and that the Singapore location has the potential to "set new benchmarks in game development".</p>
<h2>CD Projekt is a big contributor to the Polish economy</h2>
<p>We end on a story that demonstrates just how important gaming can be to national economies, and that's been illustrated this week by none other than&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>studio CD Projekt.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1806341488114073695" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) earlier this week</a>, CD Projekt revealed that it was solely responsible for an impressive 1.75% of Polish exports to the US last year.</p>
<p>That's 1.75% of all of Poland's US exports, not just those in gaming or even entertainment media. The next time someone tells you "it's just a game", make sure to throw this statistic at them.</p>

        <p>"Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Valve has seemingly purged aimbots in Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>Team Fortress 2 fans – who've long complained about the prevalence of aimbots cluttering up lobbies in Valve's tentpole shooter game – are reporting "a large ban wave" after a "prominent hoster" confirmed they had been banned.</p>

<p>Whilst fans were careful not to get too excited given there's been no formal word from Valve, Discorder Megascatterbomb said, "The strongest evidence we have of a large banwave is the Steam charts, however the maintenance period may have simply knocked them offline temporarily".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update: As of right now, it seems as though the VAST majority of aimbots have been purged. It's 7AM and I've seen no bots, that's unheard of.</p><p>This is definitely not confirmation of any long term trend, but it's a step on the treadmill, let's get them to take more. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FixTF2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FixTF2</a> <a href="https://t.co/Jolw2MGfbe">pic.twitter.com/Jolw2MGfbe</a></p></div>— Weezy (@WeezyTF2) <a href="https://twitter.com/WeezyTF2/status/1806282466077901226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However, since then, plenty of players have noticed an improvement and even newly-created bot accounts are reportedly getting insta-banned.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems developer Valve itself is banning people, not its Valve Anti-Cheat software.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>valve are now banning tf2 bot hosters and sending this message directly to them, stating "Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated"</p><p>VALVE PLEASE KEEP DOING THIS DON'T STOP <a href="https://t.co/PQ9SRZnB60">pic.twitter.com/PQ9SRZnB60</a></p></div>— heavy team fortres 2 (@heavyfortres) <a href="https://twitter.com/heavyfortres/status/1806418629581476180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Our team noticed your accounts were involved in majorly disruptive activity in Team Fortress 2. Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated, and accounts used for other purposes have been locked or banned."</p>
<p>"I just had a bot-free game, entirely, was 30 minutes and not a single bot joined or tried to join, it was wonderful," said one <a href="https://x.com/FancyNight3D/status/1806258247793352799">happy player</a>.</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/16-year-old-team-fortress-2-has-just-beaten-its-own-concurrent-user-record">Team Fortress 2 beat its own concurrent user record last summer</a>, clocking up 258,997 players.</p>
<p>Whilst that may not sound impressive given the PUBG: Battlegrounds' record-breaking peak currently sits at a hefty 3.2m players, it's important to note that even though TF2 is widely considered one of the greatest shooters of all time, it's just about to turn 17 years old.</p>
<p>The spike is likely attributable to Valve's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-fortress-2-gets-a-full-on-update-sized-update-this-summer-valve-says">all-new time-limited Team Fortress 2 summer event</a> that introduced several new maps, taunts, effects, war paints, and more.</p>

            <p>Let me continue the theme from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-how-were-all-spending-our-last-tenner-on-the-best-deals-in-the-steam-summer-sale">round-up of Steam sale reccs for under a tenner</a>, while exchanging the concept of money for the concept of time: what can you do in celebrated open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-review">"anecdote generator"</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> in two hours or less? Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-be-the-worst-wizard-in-dragons-dogma-2-act-1">the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?</p><!--more-->
<p>The trial will run from now until 19th July at 6pm BST, 10pm PT and 1pm ET. Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2054970/Dragons_Dogma_2/">Steam page</a>. Should you feel tempted to buy the full game, rejoice in the knowledge that your trial save progress will carry over. You can also effectively extend the trial by several precious moments by kitting out your character in advance using the free Character Creator &amp; Storage tool. As for what you might do in those two whole hours, beyond trouncing my preview accomplishments and revealing me for the pitiful backslider that I am - I would focus on levelling up a class to get a sense of the ability design deeper in. I would also hire-and-fire as many Pawns created by other players as you can - they'll clue you in about secrets or sidequests they've had experience of in their worlds.</p>
<p>We like ourselves a Dogmatic Dragon round these parts, but the game has a Mixed rating on Steam for reasons ranging from performance through complaints about an empty world and underwhelming story to the game's design just being a bit chaotic. One of the bigger contention-bones back at launch was the spread of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-plan-to-make-dragons-dogma-2s-dragonsplague-less-frequent-and-more-obvious">dragonsplague</a>, a Pawn ailment spread via online interactions, which could lead to major story characters getting murdered (you're highly unlikely to experience this in the opening two hours). I'm interested to know what the RPS commentariat thinks of the game in hindsight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-culprit-behind-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pc-framerate-issues-is-your-mouse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree has taken the world by storm, selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 5 million copies</a> within the first release day. However, some players still complain about the DLC, such as the difficulty factor and the PC performance issues. Now, if difficulty is a problem for you, then too bad; get better at the game. But, if you are facing issues with Shadow of the Erdtree on PC, then FromSoftware may have some solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players have reported frame rate instability in the expansion, with random frame drops disrupting their gaming experience. The <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FromSoftware Player Support</a> account X (formerly Twitter) has identified a significant factor contributing to this issue. They’ve revealed that a ‘mouse-control related app’ running in the background is the culprit behind the PC’s frame rate instability. The support team has recommended that players close this application before running Shadow of the Erdtree to improve performance.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">【ELDEN RING】PC版において、マウス制御関連のアプリを起動している状態でゲームをプレイするとフレームレートが安定しない場合がございます。その場合、マウス制御関連のアプリを停止してゲームプレイをお試しいただきますようお願いいたします。</p>— FROMSOFTWARE PLAYER SUPPORT (@fromsoftware_sp) <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1806520401314586632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The FromSoftware Support Account has addressed other PC issues, too. They have also spotted a bug in the PC version that shows an “Invalid behaviour has been detected” message. This message usually appears when players start playing or trying out multiplayer mode. The support account has advised players to try restarting the game, and if the issues persist, they should consider checking the integrity of their game files. Communication instability could also be one of the reasons for this problem. Rest assured, if you aren’t cheating, you will not be penalised when you encounter this issue in multiplayer mode.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ゲームを再起動してもこの問題が解決しない場合は、ゲームファイルの整合性確認をお願いいたします。お手数をおかけしますが、よろしくお願いいたします。<br>※本問題は通信が不安定な場合も発生する可能性があります。</p>— FROMSOFTWARE PLAYER SUPPORT (@fromsoftware_sp) <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1806619392337412531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dystopika-cyberpunk-city-builder-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had big plans for last weekend. I was going to reinstall <em>Wolfenstein </em>and blast some Nazis. I was going to try out <em>F1 24</em>. I was going to maybe even dabble in some <em>Civilization</em>, because <em>VII</em>'s reveal has it on my mind. Instead, my free time ended up getting blindsided by something else entirely: a cyberpunk city-builder* called <em>Dystopika</em>.</p><p>* Note: it is not the kind of city-builder the existing genre would have you assume. You do build a city here, yes, but...that's all there is.<a href="https://dystopika.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Dystopika</em></a><em> </em>is more like <a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a>, <em>Townscaper </em>or<a href="https://aftermath.site/summerhouse-steam-game-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Summerhouse</em></a><em> </em>than <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. You're given a blank, very dark canvas and are left to "paint" yourself a city, dropping certain types of buildings here, and others there. Drop enough of them, or do enough with the ones you drop, and you can unlock some more stuff.</p><p>You can adjust the height of buildings, add decorative effects (like neon lights and huge billboards), adjust the weather and time of day, and take some very nice photos. And that's it! There are no budgets, no rules, no emergencies to deal with, no sewerage links or power lines to bother you.<em>Dystopika </em>is, despite its lack of challenge or variety, a wonderful timesink. </p><p>What few tools it <em>does</em> give you are enough to conjure a megalopolis out of nothing, but alongside those sweeping gestures it's also able to provide hours upon hours of meditative honing as you zoom in to see tiny flying cars buzzing around and delicately place holographic adverts and landing pads on rooftops, as though you were holding a tiny pair of tweezers.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dystopika - cozy cyberpunk city builder - ambience OST #1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUjrvmyscQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While its ease of use and freedom of expression are hallmarks, another star of<em> Dystopika</em> might be its soothing <em>Lo-Fi Beats To Blade Runner To</em> soundtrack, which complements the "action" perfectly. Listen to the music in the vid above, it just hums along like this <em>forever</em>, it's lovely.</p><p>As superficial as it is, <em>Dystopika </em>is still a really good cyberpunk game, if only because--unlike, say, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which was burdened with having to reconcile the genre's aesthetics (mission accomplished) with its subject matter (eeehhh)--this is just zeroing in on the former without even bothering to deal with the latter.</p><p>Which is great! I absolutely do not want to play an actual cyberpunk city-builder. This is not a fictional space known for its strong central services and tax revenue! Focusing solely on the aesthetics and allowing us to do nothing else but swim in the vibes is just fine, thank you.</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>For decades, Hideo Kojima was one of the top video game designers and directors at Konami, as well as the driving force behind the Metal Gear series. But in 2015, Kojima left Konami behind and struck out on his own. The relationship between the two sides was reportedly strained, with Geoff Keighley revealing Kojima was not allowed by Konami to attend that year's Game Awards. Regardless, at least one producer at Konami would love to bring Kojima back to the franchise he created.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/konami-producer-says-it-would-be-the-dream-for-kojima-to-return-to-metal-gear/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Game Chronicle</a>, <a href="https://fandom.slack.com/archives/C045JJ0S5UM/p1719582757714659?thread_ts=1719582661.433959&amp;cid=C045JJ0S5UM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> producer Noriaki Okamura expressed his admiration for Kojima during a live stream. Okamura also shared his desire to have Kojima return to Metal Gear Solid in the future.</p><p>"Just speaking for myself, personally, I'd like nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again," said Okamura.

Despite Kojima's lack of involvement with the remake of Snake Eater, his story is intact in Metal Gear Solid Delta and the game will feature the original voice recordings including David Hayter's performance as Naked Snake/Big Boss.</p><p>As for Kojima, he and his team have more than enough projects to work on, including Death Stranding 2, OD for Xbox Series X, and a new property with Sony that has yet to be officially unveiled.</p>

As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, some space to shine later this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-turning-up-the-heat-with-its-super-sexy-lovestruck-expansion-pack<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The Sims team keeps bringing the heat. As part of its "summer of love" efforts, it has announced a new expansion pack for its life-simulation game.</p>
<p>It's known as the Sims 4 Lovestruck Expansion Pack, and if the reveal trailer is anything to go by, it promises plenty of sexy shenanigans including gyrating while wearing an oversized aubergine costume. Excuse me for one moment, I need to go and get myself a cold drink, 'cause things just got steamy!</p>
<p>"It's time to open your heart to romance in the beautiful world of Ciudad Enamorada! Go on swoon-worthy dates in the neighbourhood; your Sims will be able to hunt for the best spot to try the romantic blanket in the city's gardens, dance until morning at their favourite night club, or even experience the beautiful simplicity of sitting together to watch the stars," reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Ciudad Enamorada itself is described as the "perfect place" for all of these romantic experiences, with Sims 4 players able to create dating profiles for their character via the Cupid's Corner app.</p>
<p>Once Sims are all set up, there will also be the chance try out the expansion pack's new romantic interactions, which include a new kiss, a sultry dance (assume it's the one shown in the trailer above) and three new WooHoo spots.</p>
<p>Of course, while it certainly sounds like there will be the opportunity to WooHoo like you've never made your sims WooHoo before, there is still plenty of chance that hearts will be broken.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 team has introduced a Romantic Boundaries system, however. This system will allow players to "customise your Sim's experience with boundaries and jealousy", meaning they can define how any given Sim approaches romantic relationships in terms of physical and emotional romantic exclusivity. "This allows for Sims to date multiple Sims without impact to other relationships," the team said.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 Lovestruck Expansion Pack is set to saunter its way onto PC, Xbox and PlayStation next month, on 25th July, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-lovestruck-expansion-pack">retailing at £35</a>.</p>
<p>Those that pre-order the pack - or at least purchase it before 5th September - will be able to get their hands on the Cry Me a River Eyeliner (which shows the wearer's eyeliner streaming down their cheeks), the Herbert Heart Plushie, and the Basic Breakup Double Bed (according to The Sims 4 team, "your ex took the bed, but not your dignity! Mostly"). You can see these items in the second image below.</p>

  <p id="DAQNR3"><strong>Viper</strong> is a melee DPS job in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>, introduced alongside the <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion. Vipers use dual blades that attach in the middle to dish out damage.</p>
<p id="Spq5Qg">Vipers hack and slash as a scouting class, sharing its gear with Ninjas. It mainly uses three-step combos while ending its combo with different skills.</p>
<p id="KYdzac">Below, we explain what you need to do to unlock Viper in <em>FFXIV</em>.</p>
<hr id="nkFzWZ">

<p id="lyNzRz">Viper unlocks via a quest in Ul’dah. Before you head there, you’ll want to make sure you have met the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li id="3eMPX9">You have one combat job at level 80 or higher.</li>
<li id="QJHm7e">You own the <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion.</li>
</ul>
<p id="noodYa">Once you meet those two requirements, head over to <strong>Ul’dah, Steps of Nald</strong> and talk to the <strong>Worried Weaver NPC</strong> at the location below to accept the quest “Enter the Viper.”</p>

  <p id="DAQNR3"><strong>Pictomancer</strong> is a casting job in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>, introduced alongside the <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion. Using a magicked brush and palette, players can paint their spells to deal damage.</p>
<p id="Spq5Qg">This magical ranged DPS cannot resurrect allies the way that Red Mages and Summoners can, but they can buff their allies and move quickly using a magical dash.</p>
<p id="KYdzac">Below, we explain what you need to do to unlock Pictomancer in <em>FFXIV</em>.</p>
<hr id="nkFzWZ">

<p id="lyNzRz">Pictomancer unlocks via a quest in Old Gridania. Before you head there, you’ll want to make sure you have met the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li id="3eMPX9">You have one combat job at level 80 or higher.</li>
<li id="QJHm7e">You own the <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion.</li>
</ul>
<p id="noodYa">Once you meet those two requirements, head over to <strong>Old Gridania</strong> and talk to the <strong>Cheerless Hearer NPC</strong> at the location below to accept the quest “The Joy of Pictomancy.”</p>

<p>If you don’t mind a free-to-play game, especially one with such interesting gameplay mechanics as The First Descendant, then you’re liable to download said game on any system you can, right? Well, what systems is The First Descendant releasing on?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-descendant-on-playstation">Can You Play The First Descendant on PlayStation?</h2>



<p>Good news! You can play The First Descendant on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on day one. There is no waiting period for the console release, despite a clear focus on PC, and it’s still free-to-play on both systems.</p>



<p>If you visit the PlayStation Store on your specific system and search for “The First Descendant,” you’ll find the game available to download on July 2!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-descendant-on-xbox">Can You Play The First Descendant on Xbox?</h2>



<p>The First Descendant will launch on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on July 2, the same day as all other systems. However, if you go searching for the game on the Xbox Store right now, it says unavailable. On launch day, it will change to available.</p>



<p>Simply follow the usual steps by opening up the Xbox Store, searching for “The First Descendant,” and then downloading the game in the background on launch day!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-first-descendant-on-pc">Is The First Descendant on PC?</h2>



<p>On PC, The First Descendant will only be available on Steam. It’s not on the Epic Games Store, and that’s likely a good thing, depending on your personal outlook on the digital storefront. </p>

<p>Palworld’s much-anticipated expansion is now live, helping bring players back to the “Pokemon with Guns” game that went viral at the beginning of 2024. Palworld’s Sakurajima Island is now live for PCs and Xbox consoles with updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4159718272378624292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">v0.3.1</a> and a bunch of new content for the players to immerse themselves in. Learn more about the features of Palword’s Sakurajima expansion below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Sakurajima is a free expansion with a new island. Players have to work towards taking over a tower that is protected by the latest faction, “The Moonflowers”, and save the island from their evil grasp. The Sakurajima also brings some new species of Pals to capture in Palworld.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palworld players have a new spot for PvP battles, as a new arena has been introduced in the Desiccated Desert, where players around will battle it out to emerge victorious. A new stronghold under the control of Rayne Syndicate, Oil Rig, has also appeared, and you need to use the aid of your friends to defeat the dangerous enemies that lie here and acquire valuable resources such as crude oil. Sakurajima’s Crude Oil can also be extracted by placing the crude oil extractor at specific locations. Players can also use the new material Plasteel to create other extracting equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get ready to level up, Palworld players! The new cap has been set at level 55, offering more technologies and increasing the upper limit for the Pal capture bonus to 12 from 10. But that’s not all. A new raid in Palworld’s Sakurajima Island, the Blazamat Ryu, has arrived, featuring the strongest Dragon Pal yet.</p>



<p>Good news, Palworld players! You can now store 960 Pals, doubling the original capacity of 480. No more worries about running out of space for your Pals. Plus, Palworld’s Sakurajima expansion brings a host of new features, including a Meteorite event, a new medal merchant, new weapons, NPC and Pal cosmetics, buildings, and a range of fixes and adjustments. Get ready to explore and enjoy all these new possibilities!&nbsp;</p>

    <p><span>"If that could happen, that would be the dream."</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></em> production producer Noriaki Okamura would “like nothing better” than to work with <em><a title="Platforms > Meta [108 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l Gear</em> series creator <a title="People > Hideo Kojima [144 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/people/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> and the original <em>Metal Gear</em> team again, he said in the first official “<em>Metal Gear</em> Production Hotline” video released today. <span id="more-895768"></span></p><p>“It’s not my place to answer on behalf of anyone outside the company, or to guess how they might feel about it,” Okamura said. “But just speaking for myself, personally, I’d like nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again. If that could happen, that would be the dream.”</p><p>Okamura noted that Kojima and others have moved on to new things and have new commitments, so <a title="Companies > Konami Digital Entertainment [1,069 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/konami">Konami</a> cannot be dependent on them, nor set any expectations that they return.</p><p>Okamura also said that Kojima and the original <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> development staff will be credited for their original roles in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, just as they were in <em><a title="Games > Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a></em>.</p><p>The discussion about Kojima was part of a small set of user-submitted questions featured at the end of the video. Here is the full set of questions and answers:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Is there any chance that the original staff members will return to work on, co-develop, or supervise any of the <em>Metal Gear</em> series?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura, Production Producer:</strong> “Wow, okay. I can see we’re starting with a tough one, huh. Well, it’s not my place to answer on behalf of anyone outside the company, or to guess how they might feel about it. But just speaking for myself, personally, I’d like nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again. If that could happen, that would be the dream. But people have moved on to new things and new commitments, and that’s just our current reality. We can’t just take it for granted that everyone would work with us again, or let ourselves be completely dependent on them. I just don’t think it’s right for us to be the ones to make that kind of demand of anyone. So we’re working with the expectation that whatever we make, it’s up to us, it’s on our shoulders to do a good job.</p><p>“But on a related detail, since we had a lot of questions about this, Mr. Kojima and all the original development staff are of course credited for their original roles. They were already included in the [<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</em>], and they’ll be listed in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> as well. They’re a part of these games too, so absolutely, they’re in.”</p><p><strong>Will all the characters in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> have the same voice acting as the original? Will there be any new performances?</strong></p><p><strong>Okamura:</strong> “For both Japanese and English, the story of the game and all the voice acting will be the same. We definitely didn’t do any recasting. However, and this is something you see a lot in <em>Metal Gear</em>, but characters will give you advice on how to play, especially the controls. But some of those lines don’t match up with the controls on consoles now, and you can’t really have that, so we’ve actually recorded new versions of just those lines. And, sadly, some of the original cast is no longer with us, or couldn’t be available to record, so in those cases we’ve made sure that we have permission first, then went through and made use of their existing recordings to assemble the new lines.”</p><p><strong>Who is involved in the development of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>? Are you using any outside studios?</strong></p><p><strong>Okamura:</strong> “I think we mentioned this briefly in our last episode, but we do still have many of the same people who worked on the original <em>Metal Gear solid 3: Snake Eater</em> as part of the team. And, we’re also working with a number of people at outside partners. In particular, we’re working closely with the very skilled team at <a title="Companies > Virtuos [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/virtuos">Virtuos</a>, who have previously helped us on other <em>Metal Gear</em> titles as well. They’re assisting us on several fronts, especially because we’re building this game in Unreal Engine 5, instead of the FOX Engine that we’ve been using up until now. Their expertise in that area has been a huge help. We’re really glad to have them working with us.”</p><p><strong>When you decided on a remake title, why did you start with <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Okamura:</strong> “Well, <em>Metal Gear</em>, as a series, has quite a lot of ground to cover, but when we stepped back and took a look at the saga as a whole, it just made the most sense to us to start with <em>Snake Eater</em>. And I know there’s plenty of people who haven’t played a <em>Metal Gear</em> game before, and some of them probably just went, “you want us to play <em>3</em>, first?” So I just want to assure everyone, don’t worry, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> is the perfect place to get started with <em>Metal Gear</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch the full video below.

                <p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has reacted to the "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at some of the company's employees, denouncing these comments and standing behind his workforce. In an interview on the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft blog</a>, Guillemot was asked to discuss what things about the video game industry dismay him and what makes him excited for the future. Starting with what dismays him, Guillemot singled out the online attacks, and though he did not mention any specific game by name, it appears he is reacting to the reaction by some fans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p><p>"One thing I am concerned about right now is the malicious and personal online attacks that have been directed at some of our team members and partners," he said. "I want to make it clear that we, at Ubisoft, condemn these hateful acts in the strongest possible terms, and I encourage the rest of the industry and players to denounce them, too. I am proud to support the amazing work of our teams and partners, and I will always trust in their creative choices. We should all celebrate the hard work and talent that goes into making video games."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows - Who Are Naoe and Yasuke?</p>
      </div>
<p>Shadows features two playable characters, one of whom is Yasuke, a Black man modeled after a real historical figure who lived in Japan in the 16th century, arriving in the island nation with Christian missionaries. Despite Yasuke's status as a real person, some criticized the decision to include him in Shadows. Elon Musk weighed in, writing, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1794019942167191602" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"DEI kills art,"</a> and it's not hard to imagine what happened next.</p><p>Executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/assassins-creed-shadows-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> that he wanted to respond to Musk's tweet, but said it would be fruitless to do so. "By attacking someone like Elon… I will not convince people about our point of view as a team," Cote said.</p><p>"I just hope and wish that people can keep an open mind about this and see the game for what it is. It's an Assassin's Creed game, and I believe the best one we've ever built," he added (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/assassins-creed-shadows-executive-producer-says-elon-musk-is-just-feeding-hatred-with-his-reaction-to-the-games-black-protagonist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>Going back to the Guillemot interview, the CEO was also asked to talk about what he's excited about in the video game business. He said it's new technology and "the potential it can bring for our developers and, of course, for our players." Guillemot said he wished gaming hardware would evolve faster, going on to say that the lack of evolution has "held the industry back a bit when it comes to developing truly new experiences."</p><p>"If, as game makers, we can adopt and master technological advancements like generative AI and the cloud more quickly, we will be much better positioned to create new, stand-out experiences for players," he said.</p><p>For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo is confirmed to be making another console</a>, while Microsoft has said it is working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/" data-ref-id="1100-6523373">"biggest leap ever" for its next system.</a> Sony, for its part, is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PlayStation 5 Pro device.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has announced that upcoming narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>has been delayed out of 2024.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/fr/dontnod/cp/2024/06/28/don_t-nod-optimizes-the-release-window-for-its-next-leading-game-for-lost-records-bloom-et-rage-and-don_t-nod-reports-on-its" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a press release</a>, Don't Nod says the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-by-life-is-strange-devs-is-first-game-in-much-larger">announced during last year's Game Awards</a> and which was originally set to launch later this year, will now be arriving in early 2025 instead.</p>
<p>The studio says the decision comes after an "in-depth assessment of recent trends and developments in the industry", and that the delay has been put in place in order to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>"has a successful launch".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-delayed-camcorder.jpg?itok=5xWsJDdR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-delayed-camcorder.jpg?itok=BPTkgfdq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>won't be arriving as soon as you might have hoped.</figcaption></figure><p>Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert says it's important for players to give both&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>(which was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">during the Xbox show earlier this month</a>) "the space they need to be enjoyed" by players.</p>
<p>Guilbert says that he thinks the wait for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records&nbsp;</em>"will be worth it", so it sounds like the studio is confident in what it's created, even if it is going to take a couple more months to release.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, it's an upcoming narrative adventure game from the studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game revolves around a group of friends who spend an unforgettable summer together in 1995, but there's one problem: something happens during that summer that makes all of them "promise to never speak again", as the Steam page says.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, you'll know what to expect: a game that's fairly light on gameplay but heavy on storytelling, atmosphere, and character. Fans of Don't Nod's other narrative work will likely love it.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in early 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stars-reach-qa-raph-koster-dives-into-every-aspect-of-its-sandbox-mmo-with-a-fully-simulated-galaxy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, MMO fans finally have the pleasure of learning about Stars Reach, the next game envisioned by genre guru Raph Koster and his team at Playable Worlds, a studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/raph-koster-the-man-behind-ultima-online-and-star-wars-galaxies-is-back-doing-his-own-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in late 2019. Koster was the Lead Designer on the seminal Ultima Online, the Creative Director on Star Wars Galaxies, and the Chief Creative Officer on EverQuest II.</p>
<p>For Stars Reach, Koster has returned to his sandbox roots with the power of today's technology. The developers at Playable Worlds have crafted a first-of-its-kind server architecture running partly on the cloud, which allows players to fully modify the universe. In turn, the worlds (yes, plural) will react. Water flows, creating natural currents. Forests can catch fire. Flora changes as heat and humidity change. Creatures migrate as food sources are depleted. This is a single, global, persistent universe that won't reset during downtime. The actions players take affect the landscape, are visible to all, and are permanent.</p>
<p>The game aims to allow players to build a home on the planet of their choice, an underground lava mining facility, an underwater dome farm, and an orbital starport, and these are just a few examples. You will be able to rule a planet as you see fit, and there will be even areas of space where PvP is enabled. Stars Reach also adopts a fully classless system, eschewing levels in favor of skill-based progression, which means you'll never be 'outleveled' when playing with a friend.</p>
<p>I was able to speak for nearly an hour with Raph Koster about virtually every aspect of Stars Reach that I could think of. The game's ambition is through the roof, as you'll see in the full transcript below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Raph's Vision for Stars Reach - Announcement Video 4k" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FoJUeNgTWBs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let's start with the basics. What engine are you using?</strong></p>
<p>Unity.</p>
<p><strong>Are you aiming to eventually release this game on other platforms?</strong></p>
<p>We're focusing on the PC, but we have been doing work to prepare for other devices, including controller and touch-screen compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that the player's actions are permanent, but as I understand it, only as long as players are active on that planet. If they don't visit that planet anymore for any reason, the buildings will be lost or erased.</strong></p>
<p>We can decide whether or not to have the wormhole to a planet collapse based on not just the activity but whether or not players have stuff there. If there's a planet that people go to and they go and nobody builds here, let's just extract all the gold and diamonds, kill all the monsters and leave. That might be a planet that eventually goes away again.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of the setup of the universe, is Stars Reach somewhat realistic in that you have planets that have very different features? Or are they all Goldilocks (habitable) planets?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are making them all Goldilocks. However, that is because long ago, an alien civilization terraformed this arm of the galaxy to make it suitable for their genetically engineered pets, which are humans. So they set up this arm of the galaxy for us in order to eventually let us spread across the galaxy. They have disappeared now, but we have been allowed off of our homeworlds by the robot servants that they left behind. That doesn't mean that all the planets are that similar. They can have different fauna, different flora, different gravity, different day and night, different temperature ranges, different seasons, different seasonal lengths, and different year lengths. Also, there's actually a lot of variety that can happen between the different planets, but we are not planning on starting out with planets with fully poisonous atmospheres. We can do that; we just aren't starting Stars Reach that way.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe in the future. In terms of size, are the planets going to be roughly the same size, or will there be any differences in that area?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are looking at them all being the same size. Space areas will be bigger. The robot<br>
servitors do not allow you to colonize the entire planet. They basically created a force field dome and are restricting a portion of the planet and that's the part that the humans are allowed to visit.<br>
That's because they don't want us messing up the rest of the garden. They saw what we did<br>
to our home worlds. These areas, we are aiming for them to be village-sized. We are looking at zones about four kilometers on a side for planets. We'll see how big we get them; we want to push them as large as we can while preserving the idea that this is a game about a guild owning a planet, about a group of friends coming to own a planet, all of them connected in this galaxy. So they share an economy, trade, and all of that. but it isn't a game about the 10,000-person battle on a planet. It's a game about smaller groups and that is because we want to bring back that sense of community where people come to know each other, they know who their fellow planetary citizens, they establish those ties and friendships. It's not about building downtown Manhattan necessarily with millions of people crammed into a tiny space because that doesn't help build those sorts of friendships, and that is a really big part of what we are trying to do.</p>
<p><strong>Let's say that a lot of people want to go to a specific planet at the same time. Do you have some sort of instancing mechanism in place to prevent overcrowding on a single planet?</strong></p>
<p>We can do instancing, but we are actually trying to avoid it. We are avoiding phasing and all of<br>
those kinds of things because they are very gamey. What we are interested in is providing the sense of an alternate world, an alternate reality that you go into. What our tech allows us to do is have flash crowd support, so if there is an event or something and a lot of people are going to pile into a planet, we can handle a higher load than normal. That isn't the issue. But there could be queues within the galaxy. Like, if there are too many people currently orbiting this planet, then maybe the orbital space has gotten crowded.</p>
<p><strong>A space traffic jam.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our entire galaxy is running on a simulation. It is not just voxels and it's not just Minecraft style. Every cubic meter has little AIs in it. When you see water flowing downhill, what you are seeing is little water AIs holding hands and walking down the hill. It is a level of simulation that has never been seen in a game like this before'.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You've claimed that players can reshape the environments in Stars Reach. Let's talk about that.</strong></p>
<p>Our entire galaxy is running on a simulation. It is not just voxels and it's not just Minecraft style. Every cubic meter has little AIs in it. When you see water flowing downhill, what you are seeing is little water AIs holding hands and walking down the hill. That is what is going on. We know the temperature and humidity for every cubic meter of the entire galaxy. Things can be in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state. If you take a heat ray and heat up that water, it is going to turn into steam, float away, then eventually condense, and fall back into a puddle someplace.</p>
<p>It is a level of simulation that has never been seen in a game like this before. That allows us to do all kinds of new gameplay. You can shoot and bring down a cliff onto your enemies. You can open up a lava pit and watch things fall in and die. You can grow individual trees they will be healthier or not based on the kind of soil that they are growing in. I'm sure there's even more that we haven't even thought of yet, but the stuff pervades the gameplay everywhere, and all of it is a hundred percent persistent. If somebody burns the forest down, it is burned down for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Does it grow back automatically, or do you have to do it on your own?</strong></p>
<p>There is a way to grow trees and they do grow back. Every tree that you saw in that video grew there. We didn't place them; they grew there. And if we just let it run, those forests would spread over the map. So we do let players regrow the forests and so on. In fact, every planet has a health bar. The reason why humans have left their home worlds is because we've ruined them with nuclear winters, global pandemics, and climate change. So, we are going out into the galaxy, and it is a second chance for us to do better.</p>
<p>One of the things that Stars Reach is about is saying to players that they are now in charge of this planet.&nbsp;Can you keep it alive? Can you do well with it? Can you manage it successfully? Are you going to strip mine it, drive all the creatures extinct, chop down every tree, and build a strip mall here? Or are you going to try to build a pastoral peaceful village? We leave that up to the player.</p>
<p>Of course, if you build it into a shopping mall, now you have a net import economy and will have to import all of the stuff you need from other planets. Every planet has different resources with different qualities on it. They all have different creatures with different AI behaviors, different appearances,&nbsp; different stats, and so on. Every planet is unique.</p>
<p><strong>So, players could potentially ruin the planet and turn it into an arid, lifeless landscape.</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of physics examples, something that just popped into my mind is that it would be cool if there was a way to boil water while your enemy is in there. But this leads me to ask whether there is going to be any sort of magic in the game. Or is it strictly science fiction?</strong></p>
<p>Our setting is science fantasy. There isn't magic, but there is the famous Arthur C. Clarke quote that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Well, the Old Ones, the ancient civilization that made humans, had that kind of tech. Their artifacts are out there.</p>
<p><strong>You briefly mentioned the economy earlier. How is it going to work? Are there systems to trade all across the galaxy via a unified auction house, or will players have to deal with local economies?</strong></p>
<p>It is a fully player-driven economy. The entire galaxy is in one economy. You absolutely have the means to trade, but we do not show you all of the goods in the galaxy in a single auction house. The game is too big for that. We want there to be price variation across the galaxy so that the gameplay is there of smuggling goods from one sector to another, of arbitrage, finding something selling cheap here and selling it for a higher price someplace else, of finding a region of space particularly rich in particular gases or resources and trying to not let out the secret that that's the place to go to get this stuff. We have a rule that people can move fairly quickly. We never want to block you from playing with your friends. So we let you teleport to your friends, actually, sort of Altered Carbon style. You download yourself into a clone local to them, and then after you have some fun and chat with them, you rewind back to where you were.</p>
<p>But the other side of the rule is goods move slowly. They can never teleport or be cloned that way. If you want to go out into an asteroid field and start blasting away at the asteroids to harvest the crystals, you are going to end up literally dragging them behind your ship in a bunch of mesh bags, almost like a 3D game of snake and the space spiders are going to be coming and stealing it off of your tail. You will have to smuggle it through the wormhole the slow way and get it to the planet that is its destination. Whereas, if you want to play with your friends, you can just get to them very quickly and easily, but you can only take the gear that you have on your tool belt.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things in the game economy that are meant to drive that kind of interdependent gameplay, from varying statistics on different planets to the ability for players to run shops on their planets. You can have a local auction house per planet and it can advertise to nearby areas.</p>
<p><strong>Could you place an NPC vendor at your own home for people to come and buy your stuff?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We do not yet have spaceships in, but people can fly around in their spacesuits engaging in space combat. All of our combat is actiony, but we do have homing bullets and lock-on for people who want to use a more traditional tab-targeting combat.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay, cool. You mentioned space, so let's discuss that. Let's say that you have to trade goods... Is there space combat?</strong></p>
<p>Everything that I described for the planets is the same. Space is simulated just like the ground is. If you want to build your home as a space station on an asteroid, you can do that. You can tunnel holes in the asteroid, go inside, and perhaps find alien creatures living there. Yes, there is space combat. We do not yet have spaceships in, but people can fly around in their spacesuits engaging in space combat. All of our combat is actiony, but we do have homing bullets and lock-on for people who want to use a more traditional tab-targeting combat; they can do that also. They both coexist within Stars Reach. Space gameplay is actually really important.</p>
<p><strong>How will spaceships work when they make it into the game?</strong></p>
<p>When you start out, we will be handy everyone a small single-seater spaceship.</p>
<p><strong>You put out some very interesting teases in the last 10 days. Among other things, you said 'What if monsters didn't always respawn in the same place'? I always thought that it was very boring for monsters to always be in the same place in games. Is it player-driven, like do you have to hunt them down to make them move, or will they just migrate off their own volition potentially as well?</strong></p>
<p>All of our creatures run AI like The Sims. They have needs, hunger, fears, and all of that. If the environment changes around them, they might migrate because they will move around to satisfy their needs. They do reproduce. We do allow players to drive them extinct. The game does fight against that because the Old Ones and the servitors are trying to maintain the populations of the creatures. That's part of the servitors' job. There are ways for players to defeat that, but I'm going to keep it a secret for now as to how exactly those systems work.</p>
<p><strong>You also said that they may invade you in your cities.</strong></p>
<p>That's right. Let's say that there is an infestation of ice wolves. They might only come out in the winter when it is cold because they only like the cold. If the population starts to explode because nothing is a predator of theirs and players aren't killing them, then they will reproduce and their territory will spread. And yeah, then they might invade your town. On the other hand, if you killed too many of them, you could drive them extinct on that planet. One step beyond that, we have xenobiology as a profession track in Stars Reach. If you gather the genetic samples from the ice<br>
wolves, you could bring them back from extinction, too.</p>
<p><strong>In the case of NPC invasion, will they be able to damage player-made buildings?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we don't have creatures damaging people's houses. But they'll certainly damage you!</p>
<p><strong>Another interesting tease was that you might get snowed in while at a tavern. Was that just a fun tidbit, or would there be a purpose in that sort of situation?</strong></p>
<p>Due to our simulation, if you walk into the lava, it is going to burn you. It might even catch you on fire. If you walk into water waste deep, you will slow down. If you are on the edge of an icy cliff, ice is slippery in our game. If you are walking through really wet dirt, it turns into mud, and you move more slowly. So yeah, if there is snow around you, your traversal will become more difficult. We are planning to have skills that allow players to learn how to do things like navigate snowy conditions, climb super slippery cliffs, and so on. In Stars Reach, players have tools like grav meshes so they can fly and grappling hooks so they can zip around the world. But yeah, getting snowed in can be a thing, and it will affect gameplay pretty dramatically because those ice wolves might not suffer any movement penalty on ice, but you do.</p>
<p><strong>So, the environment also affects combat in a way.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. Pretty significantly, in fact!</p>
<p><strong>Something else that you said a few days ago is that you could potentially write quests and create contracts for players. How does this system work? Could you write a full quest text, or is there just a basic framework?</strong></p>
<p>It is a contract system. Let's say that I am a crafter, and I have made a crate of high-quality rifles for a guild that is buying them. They have sent me the money, and I have now made the rifles, but they are far away. I can create a mission on the contract board, a job for another player to deliver these rifles to this planet's mailbox by this date. The reward money is held in escrow. You do have a deadline. If you don't do it in time, there is a penalty. You create these contracts for other people. We can also drop authored quests into that same system, but a huge amount of the point is to allow players to help drive the economy by creating contracts between themselves. These can involve delivering things, killing things, mapping areas, and so forth. There is a pretty wide array of things that you might need a contract for.</p>
<p><strong>Can the contract system be tied to PvP? Could you ask for a player or a player guild to be hunted down?</strong></p>
<p>It could, yes.</p>
<p><strong>We have talked about a lot of the sandbox content, but at some point, you have also mentioned potentially going into an underground alien laboratory. That sounded a lot like a dungeon. Are there traditional MMO-style dungeons in Stars Reach?</strong></p>
<p>Our procedural generation tech for the planets is capable of including handcrafted content into the planets, so we have the ability to insert things like crashed pirate ships, points of interest, alien labs, etc. into the maps when they are generated. All of these maps, by the way, they are not just random soup. They are the output of a toolchain where our designers define the important aspects. We need the canyons to be this wide that combat is fun. We need the mountains to have these kinds of slopes so that traversal is fun. We need this amount of space reserved for player housing and so on. It is a very sophisticated toolchain, and it can then insert that content in and that serves as the starting point. From that point forward, the simulation runs.</p>
<p><strong>Can players expect to be fighting big bosses if they want to?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, and I think an important thing for people to know is that we are not a game where you<br>
level up and get more hit points and gain power that way, so a big, tough boss is probably going to one-hit kill you. It is a very different feeling because it's a horizontal progression system. You advance through a skill tree progression where what you're doing is acquiring more capabilities.</p>
<p>Even though that boss might just stomp you with one foot, another player can just run up to you and one-touch revive you. The dynamics of combat are actually very different from traditional MMOs. It feels much more fluid and actiony and real-time than what I think people are used to. But yeah, there's absolutely huge bosses. They have different tactics. On every planet, the creatures come with different AI tactics. A lot of that stuff is generated along with the plane, so there is a lot of variety, and as you visit different worlds, you're going to have to relearn how to fight individual enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of combat, a lot of games in the MMO genre fall somewhere on the spectrum of the so-called Trinity (tank, DPS, healer/support). How does Stars Reach work in this regard?</strong></p>
<p>There are absolutely roles within combat, even though we are a profession-based skill tree system. Players can choose to specialize in the different professions. There are tracks for different kinds of combat tactics and so on. There are the usual kinds of things, like, I can learn how to stun enemies or blind them. There are things that come with our simulation. I can freeze them or set them on fire. A key thing here is I mentioned your tool belt earlier. You venture out from camps or cities<br>
with a loadout on your toolbelt and you only have the capabilities you take with you on that tool belt, and it is a fairly limited inventory. Right now, we let you take five different tools with you.</p>
<p>Those might be guns; they might be serving tools, crafting tools, harvesting tools, or whatever. But you have to make choices. Each of those tools has what we call special moves or capabilities that are associated with them. As you skill up, you get to decide what specials you take with you that you have attached to that tool. You end up with a hotbar of five tools and about ten specials, basically. There are some extra wrinkles to that. We have charged-up shots and a variety of other things like that. That is what your hot bar is like, so even if you learn a lot of different things while you are on an adventure, you are building a loadout for a specific role and there is that interdependence with party members. If you build a toolbar meant for a solo player, then you can go out and play solo. If you want to be essentially a DPS-type person, you build a toolbar full of DPS-type tools and moves and you go up that way, but that means you won't be able to do other things that you know how to do until you come back to camp or town and swap it out.</p>
<p><strong>Loadouts are swappable whenever you're not on an adventure, then?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and these tools also have a socketing system. So you can actually custom design the way that your tools work as well.</p>
<p><strong>I'm guessing gear will be very important in Stars Reach. Do you have a rarity system?</strong></p>
<p>Everything in the game is crafted by players. Every piece of gear is customizable and has unique stats. So yes, the gear matters a lot. If you are a combatant, you depend on weaponsmiths for your<br>
weapons. Everything also can take damage and break. It might need repair. You might want to strip it and replace sockets in it. Those crafters, like the weaponsmiths, rely on the miners and the harvesters who bring them the materials. The miners rely on the people who map the planets and explore, and the explorers rely on the combatants. All these different ways to play are<br>
interrelated. We've set it all up in a large-scale economy, so yeah, gear matters a lot. If you venture out into different areas of the world, you're going to want to equip the right kind of gear for what you're doing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stars Reach Announcement Q&amp;A Video 4k" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7UzWbHa0bCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let's say you defeat one of those big bosses we talked about before. Will they drop just crafting materials rather than fully constructed items as in a traditional MMO?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly, we drop resources and materials. That said, the Old Ones and the servitors have left all kinds of technological components all over the place. Our creatures are smart enough to pick up interesting things and take them back to their lairs, so I wouldn't say that 100% of the loot is resources.</p>
<p><strong>One of the things that you mentioned in the video is that, just like in Star Wars Galaxies, there are many other professions, like Dancer. How do you plan to make them as fun as traditional professions?&nbsp; What kind of mechanics will there be, and do you have to sacrifice some of your combat proficiency to be a top-class performer, for instance?</strong></p>
<p>Stars Reach is, in many ways, the spiritual sequel to Star Wars Galaxies. We do have those kinds<br>
of things on our roadmap. We believe that peaceful play should matter just as much as the combat ways to play. We do not separate life skills into a separate track. If you want to be a player who plays entirely peacefully and never learns how to shoot a gun at all, that's fine. We think you should<br>
be rewarded by the game for doing that, be able to become wealthy and famous and progress that way.</p>
<p>We are currently looking at around 40 different professions that are spread across combat, social professions, entertainment professions, leadership, xenobiology, mapmaking, scouting and a wide area of crafting things. All of them are designed to provide either goods and services that matter elsewhere in the game, so every single one of them generates something that can result in you making money and getting progression.</p>
<p>You can learn all the skills in the game. You just can't have them all in practice at the same time. When you hit the cap on how many you can have in practice, you will have to start choosing which ones you keep active. If you want to reactivate something, it doesn't cost you anything but time. You don't need to re-level it or anything. You can just turn it back on. It will turn on after a certain amount of time in order to prevent people from cheating by just flipping everything instantly.</p>
<p>You can change your character over the course of a real-time week or something, but we let you basically fully respec your character. So yeah, you can learn everything, but you can't have all of it going at once. All the peaceful ways to play matter just as much and are on equal footing with the combat ways to play.</p>
<p><strong>It will be like relearning to ride a bike.</strong></p>
<p>That's exactly right. That's actually the logic we use.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Well, I might have a hundred more questions, but in the interest of time, I will narrow it down to a few more. When do you plan to open up Stars Reach for playtesting?</strong></p>
<p>We are starting limited testing with friends, family, and selected community members this Summer. If people are interested, they should wishlist us on Steam, sign up for our mailing list, and join our Discord because we will be starting to grab people out of the community sometime this Summer.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a roadmap for how long you plan to be in Pre-Alpha, Alpha, Beta, etc.?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It is very dependent on testing, because you have to progress through the stages of testing and get the game right, which also means, of course, it's always dependent on money. But I would say we've got at least a year and a half of work to go.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to launch Stars Reach in early access?</strong></p>
<p>It's too early to talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>What about the business model?</strong></p>
<p>Business model-wise, we've currently modeled it out, not really inventing anything, just using standard business models from today. It will be free to play with a VIP subscription, which seems to be the standard. We are definitely avoiding any form of pay-to-win.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever consider using Kickstarter or crowdfunding in general?</strong></p>
<p>Usually, people ask that more aggressively! We get asked, are you asking us for money? The<br>
answer to that is we are not asking you for money right now. We are announcing the game.</p>
<p><strong>How open are you to tweaking and modifying parts of Stars Reach based on the community's feedback?</strong></p>
<p>Very. The whole point behind announcing now while we are still in Pre-Alpha is so that players<br>
can collaborate with us on helping us make these systems what they can be, because we are making this game for players, not ourselves.</p>
<p>We have been very quiet until we could show the basics, show the innovation, show the new things we are doing. Now that we have all of that foundation in place, we are moving to an open development mode. Expect us to be blogging, posting videos and screenshots, showing things in development. Raw footage, all of that kind of thing, on a regular basis and involving the community in everything we do from here on out.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have a lot of work to do still on the visuals and we know that. We are very upfront about that. There is lighting work, there's animation work. Our visual target is in the realm of Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact, and Fortnite. That's kind of the area that we are aiming for. We are not there yet, but we are not done, and we are continuing to work on that.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Personally, if I may provide a piece of feedback, while I'm very excited about the feature set, I would say the visual style and animations still need a lot of work.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. All of that is still fairly early. In fact, when our website goes live, you'll even see an FAQ question there: are these visuals what it will be? We have a lot of work to do still on the visuals and we know that. We are very upfront about that. There is lighting work, there's animation work. There's a bunch of stuff we still need to do. With the general direction of the art style, we are not aiming for high realism. The instruction to the art department is to do to sci-fi what World of Warcraft did to fantasy, make it welcoming, colorful, and broadly appealing. High realism actually signals to the market that this is a game only for hardcore people, and that isn't really the game we are making. We want a game that you can jump in five minutes and have fun. Our visual target is in the realm of Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact, and Fortnite. That's kind of the area that we are aiming for. We are not there yet, but we are not done, and we are continuing to work on that.</p>
<p>We also need to get the frame rate up. There's plenty of work left to be done. There's a few reasons why we aim for that kind of that target. There is an audience market reason, as I just said. Also, Because of the architecture, it actually is a lot harder and more expensive to do highly detailed textures and do full realism and also have a dynamic world. We make a trade-off choice between having a slightly more cartoony world and giving you flowing water, for example. We are putting our foot on the gameplay side. That's what we are doing. But we know that the graphics still need to get better for sure.</p>
<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the character creator and the number of races/species in Stars Reach.</strong></p>
<p>We are going to support a full morphing character creator, state-of-the-art, that lets you choose faces, height, weight, gender, expression, muscularity, all of those things that you expect. It's just not quite done yet. I'm not going to say how many player species are available because we are saving those back to do gradual reveals over time. There's several more than you have seen so far. But we are sticking to humanoids because we share all of the clothing and all of the gear works across all of the different choices. It lets us maximize that aspect of the economy.</p>
<p>It was actually a pillar for the game that all the characters should be cosplayable on a budget because we want to give that ability to players. We want to see them dressed up at Comic-Con and those conventions, so we stuck mostly to these fairly humanoid shapes.</p>
<p><strong>You're using <a href="https://wccftech.com/popul8-qa-how-generative-ai-can-solve-one-of-gamings-age-old-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didimo</a>, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we're using them for the character customization. We have partnered with them pretty closely and have helped evolve their technology in order to support doing this at an MMO scale. They have been a wonderful partner.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about other uses of generative AI, like with NPCs? Is that something you'd be interested in adding to Stars Reach?</strong></p>
<p>As you know, the use of LLM and diffusion-style models is pretty controversial. Our game is built on AI. Obviously, the entire environment is AI, but it isn't LLM or diffusion-style AI. We currently do not use any of that in the game itself. This is much more a game about players taking most of the roles that NPCs usually do. That doesn't mean that there aren't any NPCs, but there are far more players in this game than there are NPCs, so that use case is not something that is really at the heart of what our game is.</p>
<p><strong>So there will be other NPCs in Stars Reach beyond the servitors you mentioned.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. There's a whole bunch of lore around not just the servitors, but also there are other genetic experiments that were created by the Old Ones that are out there. Various sorts of tentacle monster things that call themselves the Cornucopia. Expect to encounter more things.</p>
<p><strong>Raph, thank you a lot for your time.</strong></p>

  <p id="bXdhib"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>is already kicking players’ butts. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">tough-as-nails DLC</a> takes a challenging game and makes it even more difficult. Players have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dlvwmy/miyazaki_is_laughing_at_our_optimized_builds/">making jokes</a> about how a character higher than level 500 and the strongest build in the game can get pulverized by a random creature in a field. Now that it’s out, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes">FromSoftware has successfully solidified its reputation</a> for making difficult games yet again, but that’s not all. Players themselves and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186312/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficulty-too-hard-git-gud">culture around FromSoftware games</a> can make playing <em>Elden Ring </em>even more difficult, since some players shame others for using <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/qtsyad/are_spirits_this_games_easy_mode/">certain items</a> or fighting styles. </p>
<p id="TBh79S">As FromSoftware developers have diversified the toolkits that players can use to beat their games’ many monsters, a subset of intense fans has responded by discussing which ways of beating the game are valid. Tools like the Mimic Tear Ashes can summon a duplicate of a player’s character to fight alongside them during a boss fight, or magical spells like Meteorite of Astel can fire a barrage of meteors against an enemy. These items exist within the regular base version of the game, but some people argue they can lessen specific challenges since they can be used from afar. Now, with the difficulty up even higher for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, prominent streamers and players on social media platforms like Reddit are taking to the platforms to discuss why it’s actually OK to use these tools — especially now that the DLC is even more difficult. </p>
<p id="HlQBca">Im_dontai, a streamer with more than <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/im_dontai">1.9 million followers on Twitch</a>, has been streaming the DLC since its release. In a clip, he pushed back on the larger culture of players who disapprove of using features like a magic build or the Mimic Tear and people complaining about the difficulty of the game. </p>

<p id="nbWeC2">“It’s because y’all are playing it the way that the internet is making you feel like you gotta play,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sukgumi/video/7383734081168608555">Imdontai said on a stream</a>. “Yo, no magic, no summons, no mimic, no armor. [...] The game is hard as hell, and I got my motherfucking Mimic by my side, bro. I’m playing how I want to play. I don’t care who calls me a bitch, and you shouldn’t either. Play the game how you want to play the game.” </p>

<p id="lm4IdG">The idea that <em>Elden Ring</em> should be played without summons originates prior to the release of that game and ties to a decade-plus-long conversation about difficulty in FromSoftware’s previous games. All modern FromSoftware games have included ways for players to get help with certain challenges, either by enlisting NPCs or other players to fight alongside them. <em>Elden Ring</em> also expanded much further upon the repertoire of fighting styles and magical powers available to players. Yet there are still some players who say that this isn’t the “right” way to play a FromSoftware game. If you had an issue beating a boss, magic and summons aren’t the answer. The proper response, according to die-hard fans, was to “git gud” and learn the proper patterns of attack for each boss without the need for magical ranged attacks, NPC summons, or (in the case of <em>Elden Ring</em>) spirit ashes. But now, players have their hands on the DLC, and it’s… well… really dang tough! So much so that it has sparked a larger conversation about the role of summons and other supports in the game. </p>

<p id="yeWzgA">Reddit user TheHessianHussar shared a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dmk313/to_everyone_still_not_using_summons/">post on Reddit</a> discussing summons that has been upvoted more than 11,000 times. “To everyone still not using summons.... Just do it. The game is literally balanced around them,” the user said. “I am myself an oldschool souls gamer and I was one of the people who refused to use summons, since I wanted to play the old way. The ‘ethical’ way I told myself. But let me tell you, they are no longer optional.”</p>
<p id="uOYahm">Commenters resonated with the general sentiment of pushing back against those who say you shouldn’t play the game with the additional support. One person responded by likening the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dmk313/comment/l9wm3yw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sentiment to</a> “low-self-esteem, insecure teenage bullshit,” and others said that people who don’t like players using summons can go “touch grace.” It’s not as if using sorcery and summons makes a difficult game that much easier; each player still has to learn how to fight each boss. Additionally, <em>Elden Ring</em> is largely a single-player game, and whether or not someone uses summons doesn’t impact other players.</p>
<p id="XIj40b">The Reddit post insinuated that you <em>need</em> summons to beat the DLC. That’s not exactly true, but maybe the time has come to simply let people play the game the way they want to. In cordial conversations about the idea of using no-summons runs in <em>Elden Ring</em>, some players have talked about how “rewarding” it can feel. Any way you play <em>Elden Ring</em>, whether you like it as a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22957071/elden-ring-torrent-ultimate-horse-companion">horse-girl simulator</a> or you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionsouls/comments/144eufw/my_elden_ring_fashion_gotos/">play it for the fashion</a>, the game can feel rewarding. You <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24184982/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficult-hard-boss">can even run away</a> and that’s still a valid way to deal with an overwhelming enemy! So now, at least some players are supporting each other — summons or not — in playing the game however each person wants to. </p>

  <p id="oZ88Ao"><small>This essay on </small><small><em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em></small><small>was originally posted in conjunction with the movie’s arrival on Netflix. It has been updated and reposted now that the film is leaving Netflix on July 1.</small></p>
<p id="16PYaG">One of the great mystery movies and neo-noirs of the late 20th century is leaving Netflix soon, featuring one of Denzel Washington’s finest roles. <em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em>, Carl Franklin’s adaptation of Walter Mosley’s excellent 1990 novel, is leaving the streaming service July 1. The movie is 100 minutes of atmospheric excellence. It’s tense when it needs to be, sexy when it wants to be, and always captivating. </p>
<p id="6jbmMp">In late 1940s Los Angeles, Denzel Washington is Ezekiel “Easy” Rawlins, a World War II veteran recently laid off and looking to make ends meet. When a friend introduces him to a private investigator looking to hand off a seemingly straightforward job — find a missing woman — Easy gets pulled into a web of conspiracies and deception, putting him in the crosshairs of some of the most powerful people in the city.</p>

<p id="G0JxLl">It’s a gripping story about postwar racial divisions in 1940s LA, and every element of the movie works in concert to create a complete picture of its main character and the world he inhabits. <em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em>fires on all cylinders, using every avenue available in cinema. Gorgeous cinematography, period-accurate production design, an evocative score, standout performances, sharp dialogue, and a whirlwind narrative all support and build on each other. There’s nothing extraneous in <em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em> — every single decision works together to create a larger whole.</p>
<p id="wLQZST">The film is particularly deft at displaying how Washington’s noir lead isn’t able to navigate the world in the same ways as white detectives in similar films, something Franklin was particularly interested in exploring within the movie.</p>
<p id="5oYCo8">“Obstacles are the key to drama,” <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/07/carl-franklin-interview-devil-in-a-blue-dress-and-denzel-washington.html">Franklin told Slate</a> in 2022, when the movie was added to the Criterion Collection. “If it was a Sam Spade character, you know there’s going to be the one cop who’s going to be cool with him, and the other cop is going to want to break his neck. In Easy’s case, both cops want to break his neck.” </p>

<p id="vuUZea">Easy is a rich role — a smart, caring man just trying to hold on to his life, serving the role of a detective without being part of the law enforcement system. Washington absolutely delivers on that role’s potential. He’s confident, calculating, effortlessly cool, and as sexy as he’s ever been. While Washington had already been nominated for three Oscars and won one (for <em>Glory</em>) by the time this movie came out, his star was still rising. It’s a joy to revisit that part of his career.</p>
<p id="IdN9cN">Washington’s striking performance is supported by excellent co-stars: Jennifer Beals gives a particularly alluring performance, and Washington has electric, instant chemistry with her and with Lisa Nicole Carson. Tom Sizemore oozes scuzziness<strong> </strong>as the duplicitous PI who hires Easy. And Don Cheadle steals the show in a minor role<strong> </strong>as Easy’s chaotic friend Mouse. Mouse is the kind of supporting role that allows for that, as the loudest, funniest guy in the room — and he won multiple critics’ awards for his performance.</p>

<p id="1zbJ5J">While <em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em>got positive reviews, it <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1817150977/weekend/">did not do very well at the box office</a>. Franklin <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/07/carl-franklin-interview-devil-in-a-blue-dress-and-denzel-washington.html">attributed that in part</a> to the release’s unfortunate proximity to the O.J. Simpson verdict announcement, which he feels complicated America’s feelings about a crime story ostensibly involving a Black man and a white woman. Franklin, who had previously directed the surprise-hit low-budget crime thriller <em>One False Move </em>starring Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton, never got to make another Easy Rawlins movie. He told Slate that Sony bought the rights to the first three books of the series, and the hope was to make it a franchise. (At the time, there were four books in the series. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Amethystine-Walter-Mosley/dp/031649111X?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Amethystine-Walter-Mosley/dp/031649111X?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23850768__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23850768__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">As of June 2024</a>, Mosley will have published 16 of them.) But <em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em>’ poor box-office performance stopped that plan right in its tracks. It’s a shame, because it’s easy to imagine how excellent a Washington/Franklin Easy Rawlins franchise could have been.</p>
<p id="95uind">If you end up falling for this movie too, the <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/32355-devil-in-a-blue-dress">recent 4K release from Criterion</a> is well worth buying — it brings out Tak Fujimoto’s moody cinematography and the movie’s performances extremely well. But for now, check it out on Netflix while you can. It’s among <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21266801/best-movies-on-netflix">the best movies the service has to offer</a>. </p>
<p id="HlMVcS"><small><em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em></small><small>is leaving Netflix July 1.</small></p>
