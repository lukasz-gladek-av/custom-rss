<p>In our Football Manager review, I wrote, <em>“Football Manager 26 is the first step of a new era, and as we’re seeing with some of the biggest clubs in the country, any new era comes with the challenge of rebuilding and both setting and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better with updates, but I doubt that this entry will be the one to make the most of the switch to the new engine, overhauled UI and new features. It might take one or two more years for this rebuild to really meet its potential.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Last week, Nintendo surprised everybody with an announcement: Over four years after its “<a href="https://youtu.be/aZ3QC8e1_yg?si=xf6L-A2b_nt4OgDX&amp;t=699">last major free content update</a>,” <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is getting a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">Switch 2 upgrade and a free update for all players</a>. It’s not often that an incredibly popular game goes <em>years</em> between updates, but since when has anyone been able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">predict what Nintendo will do</a>?</p></div><p>In 2021, the company was very clear that the 2.0 update would be the game’s last. Slowly but surely, most of us stopped playing, accepting that support for <em>New Horizons</em> had ended. Well, sike, I guess! In preparation for the 3.0 update and Switch 2 Edition this January, we at <em>The Verge</em> decided to check in on our islands and see what we’ll be coming back to in a few months.</p><p>I’ll admit, I was expecting a much bigger mess. While I haven’t played <em>New Horizons</em> in ages — the villagers tell me it’s been 11 months, though it feels much longer — my kids have jumped into the island periodically during that time. And, just like in real life, they’re slobs in <em>Animal Crossing</em>. Yet our island appears mostly intact. There were a few items strewn about, and a shockingly small number of weeds, but not much else to complain about. Mostly, without me to do the gardening, the entire island is now one gigantic field of flowers. It’s beautiful and not at all what I was anticipating. Even more shocking: Both of their houses were tidy. Now if only I could get them to do that in real life. —<em>Andrew Webster</em></p><p>Returning to Isla Ashtra has been a neat exercise in forensically investigating my own brain. After being away for many years — one villager told me it was five years and four months, to be exact — there are some parts of my island where I can clearly see my thought process and other places where I have no idea what the hell I was thinking. I was pleased to see my little pizza shop and fondly remembered the process of remixing mundane items like a hat into a clever pizza display. But, as I continued to explore, I found items discarded randomly about — a crystal ball here, a mirror there — and I simply cannot intuit why they’re there. Maybe I meant to make a tarot shop, or maybe I just needed to free up some inventory space. Who knows? Certainly not me. —<em>Ash Parrish</em></p><p>My island, once populated with lovable neighbors and thoughtful placement of shrubs and amenities, is gone. It has been wiped from existence by its creator, me, in a swift act of negligence while moving data from an original Switch to a Switch 2. I guess I didn’t do something correctly. Oops. Precious erased neighbors, cover your ears for what I’m about to say. I should feel more sad, but I’m not. Maybe I’ll become engrossed in building a new island once the Switch 2 Edition update comes out in January. If I do, I will erect a memorial to you all on it that I hopefully don’t accidentally erase someday. —<em>Cameron Faulkner</em></p><p>My house is perfect, an oasis of organized calm. The kitchen is warm and inviting, espresso maker on the counter beautifully complimenting the totally-not-a-KitchenAid mixer on the sideboard. There are no clothes strewn on the hardwood parquet of my bedroom floor. Upstairs, in the office, there is nothing on my desk except my laptop and a mug of coffee. The bathroom, too, is spotless. If only I could say the same for literally any part of my real home, where my children — now ages 12 and 7 — currently sit on our stained, ratty sofa, fighting over who gets to be the lead player in <em>ACNH</em> today.</p><p>The truth is, my island house is not a home but a fly trapped in amber — a fossil, fixed and unchanging. My daughter was 6 and my son a baby when I first started playing, and back then I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/04/parenting-in-a-pandemic-chaos-control-and-an-animal-crossing-meltdown/">was able to exert some measure of control</a> over the island and, by extension, over anything else at all, in a world gone even madder than average. But really, the world is theirs to inherit, and to remake in their image. And they have done so, with flowers, trees, rocks, and even houses in unexpected, unfamiliar places. The part of me that has learned to make peace with the chaos is allowed to overrule the part of me that craves organization. If only they wouldn’t leave so much crap to trip on lying around on the ground everywhere — in <em>both </em>our worlds. —<em>Kate Cox</em></p><p>I played <em>New Horizons</em> every single day for two years, amounting to what my Switch Lite tells me is over 1,700 hours of time spent on my island. I collected every single item in every single colorway. I unlocked every DIY recipe and, after the 2.0 update, every cooking recipe. My storage is full of spare Nook Miles Tickets and crafting ingredients and rare seasonal items. But my island itself? It’s completely unfinished. The fish market along the southern shore gives way to a vast field of wheat (and artfully placed weeds), and then… nothing. The river lies incomplete and connected to no water source. The museum sits alone at the top of a hill I never finished building. And I’d moved all the villagers’ houses to the beach to keep them out of the way for a construction period that never ended.</p><p>I am so unbelievably excited to have a reason to complete that construction. I’ll see you all in January. —<em>Kallie Plagge</em></p><p>When I last fired up <em>New Horizons </em>three years, 11 months, and (estimating here) a couple of days ago, I had no idea all of the hoops you had to jump through in order to move your island between consoles. I left my island, LilHalcyon, thinking I could always return — even on a new Switch — once I downloaded the game again. <em>Had </em>I heard people telling each other about the importance of backing up your island online and using the Island Transfer Tool? Probably, but I didn’t take that advice to heart. This is how I wound up in a mild panic, confused as to why LilHalcyon wouldn’t load up on my Switch 2. As I sat there looking at Tom Nook in a void of darkness telling me he couldn’t find a backup on my OLED Switch either, I thought something might have gone wrong with the download process and all my villagers had been lost in the ether.</p><p>But then Kallie pointed out that I probably never moved things over from my long-uncharged OG Switch — and she was right. I was relieved to see all of my old buds still knocking around. All of the roaches and weeds were kinda gnarly, but LilHalcyon was still the charming little homestead I remembered. A couple of other villagers speculated that I was a figment of their imaginations who might have never existed in the first place. But I’ve let them all know that reports of my (and our island’s) death have been greatly exaggerated. —<em>Charles Pulliam-Moore</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Verge Staff</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/814497/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-2025-return]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-sales-ubisoft-politics-culture-war-2000641428</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-ubisoft-details-its-battle-to-overcome-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%98haters%E2%80%99.1344949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> became a target for right-wing culture warriors ranging from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587">random shareholders</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">to Elon Musk</a>. In a recent video shown at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft reportedly tried to take back ownership of the narrative surrounding the attacks and demonstrate a potential playbook for dealing with haters online. How much of it is just spin remains to be seen, but it’s an unusual move for a company that usually shrinks from controversy.</p> <p>The video’s existence <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">was reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, including a partial transcription of what it said and additional comments from CEO Yves Guillemot after it was shown to gaming industry members during an event at the conference. The brief presentation detailed the company’s version of events, positioning the game’s unexpected delay last year as a bold move.</p>

 <p>Instead of shying away from criticisms lobbed from certain corners of the internet that Ubisoft was “virtue signaling” by featuring the story of African samurai Yasuke, it doubled down on polishing the game and highlighting the elements that made it<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>. So the theory goes, anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft has stopped sharing sales data with Circana who reports the software &amp; hardware sales in the us.</p> <p>First image the top selling games of 2025 as of June including AC Shadows, second image top selling games of 2025 as of July without Shadows.</p> <p>Mat from Circana confirmed this <a href="https://t.co/4WuKoSgRhP">pic.twitter.com/4WuKoSgRhP</a></p> <p>— JorRaptor (@Jorraptor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“With our allies beside us, we found confidence again: To stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters,” the narrator of the marketing video says, according to <em>Game File</em>. “And by the time<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launched, thanks to our fans, momentum was finally on our side.”</p>

 <p>Guillemot elaborated on the pivot in a conversation afterwards. “We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” he said, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Game File</em>‘s translation</a>. “And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.”</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ sales figures are in stealth mode</h2> <p>It’s an echo of something the cofounder said shortly after announcing the game’s delay. “I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda,” he told investors last year in an apparent attempt to beat the allegations of the company’s worst critics. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-game-cancel-reconstruction-black-slave-2000633318"><em>Game File</em> also reported</a> that the company canceled an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> set in post-Civil War America over concerns about political unrest.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft did hit back at critics earlier this year. The official <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1897048261619540235">dunked on one of the most high-profile social media accounts</a> leading a campaign against the game. But developers working on the game were <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">reportedly also advised</a> not to post about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ release to avoid becoming a target of the harassment campaign.</p> <p>How has this all worked out for Ubisoft? It’s hard to tell. <em>Shadows</em> was well reviewed at launch and sold well in its first few months. It was the third top-grossing game in the U.S. as of June, but Ubisoft has stopped sharing public sales data in the months since and hasn’t officially confirmed <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1960794645308252467%7Ctwgr%5Edbaadbf897184f93beb9cf56c0dee354ed10b92a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">exact sales figures</a>. It must have been happy enough with the results to move ahead with other delays. Ubisoft told investors earlier this year that a slate of unannounced upcoming blockbusters <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">would take longer than expected to ship</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a shocking move, D-CELL GAMES’ Unbeatable has been delayed to early December, with less than 12 hours until its planned launch. As to why the last-minute delay happened, it seems an unreleaseable bug was found and needs to be fixed urgently.</p>



<p>Announced via Kickstarter in 2021, Unbeatable is an anime-inspired rhythm game releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. As vocalist Beat, you’ll resist a tyrannical government that outlawed music. With the help of your band, you’ll bring music back to the world via engaging rhythm gameplay. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo for the game</a> was released on PC and PlayStation 5 and was well-received by fans. The game was originally set to release on November 6th, but according to the developer, it won’t launch until December.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a developer post on Steam</a>, RJ Lake, one of the game’s directors, announced that Unbeatable is now coming out on December 9th, 2025. The game was expected to launch in less than 12 hours, so the delay is very last-minute. As to why, the team cites a low-repro progression blocker that would require pushing the console release date back if fixed. To that end, to ensure the game releases on all platforms simultaneously, it has been pushed to December. </p>



<p>Delays for games are a rare occurrence, much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less at the last minute</a>. Given the popularity of Unbeatable, it’s sure to be disappointing. However, D-CELL GAMES does mention that, with the extra time, it’ll be able to work on some pre-launch content it couldn’t get to. So, while it’ll be a month before we get to play it, the version we’ll get will hopefully be the best possible one.</p>



<p>What do you think of Unbeatable’s last-minute delay? Are you disappointed? Did you play the demo? If so, did you enjoy it?

It can be a lot of fun to track things down on your own, but it can also prove challenging at times. If you're struggling to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest, we'll help you along with things.</p><p>Note that you need to extract from the topside with Major Aiva's Patch once you obtain it. With this in mind, it's a good idea to bring along an augment with a safe pocket so that you can ensure you don't lose your quest item even if you fall in battle.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, read on for where to find Major Aiva's Patch in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest</h2><p>Your first objective for Echoes of Victory Ridge will be to actually find Victory Ridge, which is located in the northern portion of the Dam Battlegrounds map. Zoom in and seek the West Broken Bridge POI--that's where you're headed. Note that this is a mostly safe area in the majority of matches, but you never know if you might run into other questers, so keep an eye out and try to be friendly. Or shoot them on site--it's your call.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275" data-ratio="0.55354993983153" data-width="1662" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275"></a><figcaption>West Broken Bridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the circled area above, you'll need to look for a small box containing Major Aiva's Patch. This can be hard to spot if you don't know where to search. Look around for part of the fallen road that can be crawled under--more easily spotted if standing on the northern end of the POI and looking south. Under the right side of this crumbled road is the box with Major Aiva's Patch inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277"></a><figcaption>Major Aiva's Patch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg"></figure><p>Place Major Aiva's Patch in your safe pocket if you came equipped with one, then head east to the North Complex Elevator to extract. There are often a lot of ARC patrolling here, so retreat to safety after calling the elevator if you get their attention and can't fight your way out of it. Hopefully, you'll get back to Speranza and turn this quest in so you can move along to the next one.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

Some of the companies that Nintendo has acquired in the past 10 years have included Shiver, Dynamo Pictures, SRD, and Next Level Games.</p><p>Beyond buying companies outright, Nintendo said it will use some of its money to fund internal development and expansion, including through the construction of a second building at its corporate headquarters in Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, Netflix is once again looking at making a TV series adapted from a video game, but it's not something like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/">adaptation of The Witcher</a> or its <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/">new Splinter Cell animated series.</a> Alongside A24, Netflix is reportedly making a reality TV cooking competition, based on the beloved indie co-op cooking game, Overcooked.</p>



<p>The report describes it as a show that'll follow a similar path to Netflix's other viral cooking shows like 'Nailed It!' and 'Floor is Lava.' Phil Duncan, Oli De-Vine, and Gemma Langford from Ghost Town Games, the studio behind Overcooked, are reportedly working on the adaptation as executive producers.</p>



<p>Both Netflix and A24 declined to comment on the report, so for now, we only have Deadline's report to go off of. While Deadline has the kind of track record where we can safely assume that this will be confirmed soon, nothing's impossible, and it could be the case that this project, if it is in development, never makes it across the finish line.</p>



<p>If that were to happen, though, what a disappointment that would be, because there is no game better suited to be adapted in this way. Of course, some of the shenanigans that players get up to in Overcooked are too fantastical to be feasible in the real world, but it would be an undeniably entertaining show if chefs had to toss ingredients to each other, jump over gaps to get to different stations, and cook with the kinds of insane limitations and obstacles players face in Overcooked.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this is not a project that ends up in the trash.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced that tickets for BlizzCon 2026 will go on sale on Friday, November 7, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time through Sunday, November 9, at midnight Pacific Time. These will be 'Early Bird' tickets available for $249.99 (a price that includes all taxes and fees) while supplies last. The organizers also confirmed that the maximum number of purchasable passes per account has been increased from two to four.</p>



<p>The second wave of tickets will go on sale starting Tuesday, November 18, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time, for $289.99. A ticket grants two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon 2026 on both Saturday and Sunday, including access to all Halls and Arena, during show hours. Moreover, fans will also obtain some in-game goodies (currently unspecified) and exclusive items to commemorate the event. Tickets will go on sale <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/bc/events/blizzcon-2026-159916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Tixr</a> and you'll need an account to buy them.</p>



<p>As usual, the main event will be the Opening Ceremony, where Blizzard holds the biggest announcements and reveals. The Opening Ceremony will take place on the Main Stage in Hall D, with seats available on a first-come, first-served basis. In this case, we might see the launch news of the next Diablo IV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to be released at some point in 2026</a>. World of Warcraft: Midnight, on the other hand, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be scheduled to launch in February</a>. That said, there will undoubtedly be news about updates for World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal throughout the event, especially in the dedicated developer panels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-makes-a-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had confirmed earlier this year</a>, BlizzCon 2026 will take place at the usual venue, the Anaheim Convention Center, on September 12 and 13. The fan-focused convention returns after a three-year hiatus; the last BlizzCon took place on November 3 and 4, 2023, and the big announcement was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>, a trilogy of World of Warcraft expansions (The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan) featuring a continuous storyline written by returning writer guru Chris Metzen.</p>

<p>What appears to be a nearly full lineup of Intel Core Ultra 300 Panther Lake CPUs has been leaked online ahead of an official announcement. </p>



<p>The new CPUs, which were listed by known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1986086104286597269">jaykhin0</a>, show processors ranging from the high-end Core Ultra X9 388H to the Core Ultra 3 322. When it comes to Cores, Panther Lake features a max of 16 cores, depending on the chip. For clock speed, users are looking at a max boost of 5.1 GHz for the top processor while the more entry-level options reach 4.4 GHz. </p>



<p>It’s unknown if this is the complete family of CPUs for the next mainline release, but it’s enough to get an idea of what enthusiasts should expect. You can check out all of the early specs for yourself below.</p>



<p>Intel is rumored to release Panther Lake to the public in Q1 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A24 and Netflix are teaming up for a new video game adaptation: Overcooked. Furthermore, it will take the form of an unscripted reality cooking competition.</p>



<p>If you are an avid multiplayer fan, no title has come close to being as fun and frustrating as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overcooked</a>. Created by Ghost Town Games, the cooking simulator made waves in 2016 for its stressful yet enjoyable gameplay. Since then, a sequel and remaster have come out and it remains one of the best co-op indie titles in recent years. Now, it seems the concept of the game is making its way to one of the world’s biggest streaming platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-a24-planning-unscripted-competition-show-based-on-overcooked">Netflix and A24 Planning Unscripted Competition Show Based on Overcooked </h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, the outlet revealed that A24 has acquired the rights to Overcooked and wants to adapt the game into a cooking competition. With that, Netflix is said to be teaming up with the company to stream the series. No official comments from Netflix or A24 are available at this time. </p>



<p>As for what the show will look like, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a> says it’ll be similar to Nailed It! and The Floor is Lava, two family-friendly shows Netflix has. Still, the high-octane challenges and ensuing chaos will remain, which were key to the game’s rapid success. Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine, and Phil Duncan from Ghost Town Games and A24 are set to executive produce the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how Overcooked is translated into reality TV. Fortunately, we won’t be the ones cooking and stressing out this time. Still, seeing how fun it is to watch people play it will definitely make for some fun television. As a fan of cooking shows myself, Overcooked is a great IP to bring to life in that way and I look forward to seeing how it comes out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Overcooked being a cooking competition? Did you play the game? Any good (or bad) memories with it? Could you do it in real life? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

Here’s a worse one: <em>UNBEATABLE</em> will now release on December 9.</p><p>I hate that I have to say this. There’s no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I’m personally sorry about this and I wish it was different.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Why Would You Only Tell Me Now?</strong></p><p>Because the decision was only made a few hours ago. (No, really, I’m writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can.</p><p><strong>But Why? The Game’s Done, Right?</strong></p><p>There’s a very boring and frustrating reason; [quality assurance] hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of [certification] timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.</p><p><strong>But Why Not Just Delay the Release of the Console Port?</strong></p><p>That’s very messy! We’d rather release the game all at once for everybody.</p><p><strong>But Why Release on December 9? That’s a Whole Month Away!</strong></p><p>Another boring reason you can figure out pretty quickly by googling the phrase “2025 game release calendar” and looking at what’s hitting this month. We had a pretty good spot on November 6 where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a lot to find another island, and that’s the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us breathing room we didn’t have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow.</p><p><strong>…But is the Game Good?</strong></p><p>It’s very good, and I’m very biased. We’ll see what reviewers think. But for those of you waiting the longest for this thing to come out, it makes me feel a bit crazy knowing how much you still don’t know about what’s this thing is. I’m very excited about it. I wish it could have been tomorrow, but.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who’s rooted for us up until this point. It’s not much longer now.</p><p>—RJ Lake and everyone at D-CELL and Playstack</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/unbeatable-delayed-to-december-9]]></content:encoded>

                <p>You'll take on a lot of quests that send you to the Dam Battlegrounds in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, including one from Tian Wen who wants you to search for Major Aiva's Mementos in some apartment buildings. This is a straightforward quest on paper, but because there are multiple buildings to explore and the ever-looming threat of ARC and other raiders, it's best to know right where to find these mementos so you can get out quickly.</p><p>Since you need to extract with Major Aiva's Mementos, it's a good idea to equip an augment that lets you store an item in a safe pocket. Once you pick up the mementos, you can toss it in that safe pocket and take it home with you even if you end up dead before you can extract.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's find Major Aiva's Mementos and wrap up The Major's Footlocker quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva’s Mementos for The Major's Footlocker quest</h2><p>Major Aiva's Mementos can be found in an apartment building located at the Ruby Residence POI.

The item you're looking for is on the top floor (not the roof). Head up two flights of stairs, then wrap around and follow the rooms until you reach a dead end with a window and a box on a desk in the corner.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg"></figure><p>This box contains Major Aiva's Mementos. You'll need to interact with it, then pick up the item and store it in your inventory.</p><p>As stated above, you're required to extract with this item. Hopefully, you have a safe pocket slot! Either way, your closest options are likely to be the Central Swamp Lift to the south or the North Complex Elevator to the east. The safer choice is probably the latter, as the former tends to stay pretty busy with other players perusing the swamp for mushrooms and other quests. Whichever you choose, play things safe and get out alive, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Early Black Friday deals are slowly trickling in, including a limited-time offer on NordVPN. The VPN company is offering its several of its <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F%3Fi%3Dxly&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subscription plans for up to 77% off</a>, with an additional 3 months tacked on for even better value</strong>. Using a VPN is a good way to buff up your privacy capabilities and maintain access to region-locked content while traveling. If you've been on the fence, NordVPN's discounted prices make now a great time to consider a subscription.</p><p>NordVPN is offering all 24-month and 12-month versions of its Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime subscription tiers at significant discounts, with an additional three months included. That's 15 total months of VPN service for far less than you'd normally pay.</p><p>The 24-month Prime plan offers the best value. It includes full access to the VPN, plus additional incentives such as 1TB of cloud storage, advanced identity protection, and the NordProtect service, which has a robust suite of insurance, Dark Web monitoring, and credit freeze assistance options. The 24-month Prime plan normally costs $836.73, but with the discount, new subscribers can sign up for just $186. That's a whopping $650 savings, and it includes the bonus three months, for a total of 27 months.</p><p>If you're looking for something in the short term, the 12-month plans are also discounted, and each one includes the three extra months. For example, the 12-month Prime subscription includes everything in the 24-month plan, but instead costs $127.35 (normally $464.85/year), and you're getting 15 months at that price thanks to the bonus three months.</p><p>We've included a quick breakdown of NordVPN's discounted plans below, and you can browse the full details of the deal at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F%3Fi%3Dxly&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NordVPN's website</a>. NordVPN lists the monthly cost of its plans, but the 2-Year plans are actually billed every 24 months, and the 1-Year plans are billed annually, so you'll pay the full price for the subscription period upfront when you sign up. NordVPN also offers monthly plans, but these are not eligible for the Black Friday deal. It's also important to note that your subscription will revert to the standard price after the promotional period ends, unless you cancel or update your plan before the end of the promotional period.</p><h2>NordVPN Black Friday Deals</h2><h4>2-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $80.73 (<del>$313</del>)</li><li>Plus 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $105 (<del>$404.73</del>)</li><li>Complete 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $132 (<del>$493.83</del>)</li><li>Prime 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $186 (<del>$836.73</del>)</li></ul><h4>1-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months --$68.85 (<del>$173.85</del>)</li><li>Plus 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $82.35 (<del>$224.85</del>)</li><li>Complete 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $97.35 (<del>$274.35</del>)</li><li>Prime 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $127.35 (<del>$464.85</del>)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box/1100-6535705/">Adorable New Astro Bot Collectibles Are Waiting To Be Rescued By You</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is an anime-inspired "arcade-flawless" rhythm game that was set to launch tomorrow, on November 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. However, developer D-Cell Games has delayed Unbeatable to next month, just hours before the game's launch, citing a progression-blocking bug that it says must be fixed before release.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unbeatable was supposed to come out tomorrow," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/598542531394797771?l=english">announcement</a> on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> reads. "That's a scary sentence. Here's a worse one: Unbeatable will now release on December 9. I hate that I have to say this. There's no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I'm <em>personally </em>sorry about this and wish it was different."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/ASRfsN8-okg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASRfsN8-okg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The delay announcement features a QA and in the "Why would you only tell me now?" section, D-Cell responds, "Because the decision was only made a few hours ago (No, really, I'm writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the very last-minute delay, D-Cell says, "QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that's serious enough it's considered unreleasable," and that "fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and <em>not </em>fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We're fixing it."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the game is being delayed more than a month to December 9, it is due to other games launching over the next month. D-Cell says the team had a pretty good spot on November 6, "where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a <em>lot </em>to find another island, and [December 9] is the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us some breathing room we didn't have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow."&nbsp;</p><p>Unbeatable will now launch on December 9 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-releases-in-november">check out the Unbeatable reveal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/05/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-delayed-to-december-hours-before-its-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s easy to grow jaded as a gamer, and even easier to forget why you got interested in games to begin with. As trends in video games change, you may find yourself longing for an imagined yesteryear, where that spark was still fresh. As a member of the diehard cult that hopes that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-delays-the-wolf-among-us-2-till-at-least-next-year-because-if-its-half-baked-were-going-to-get-torn-to-shreds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Wolf Among Us 2</em> will ever see the light of day</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>feels like a return to the experimental golden age of episodic choice-driven storytelling, where fun isn’t in photorealism but in the online water cooler buzz of what you chose and why.</p><p>After bingeing the first four playable episodes of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, I found myself swept back (<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-narrative-superhero-game-episodic-telltale-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside other like-minded, nostalgic players</a>) into the magic of<em> Life is Strange</em> and <em>The Walking Dead—</em>the very games that ignited my love for storytelling in my teens when an innocuous <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange/b/playstation4/archive/2015/01/29/life-is-strange-episode-one-chrysalis-review-game-informer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameInformer magazine blurb</a> first sold me on the dream of games playing like episodic TV. It follows Robert Robertson (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-video-game-interview-2000672017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Aaron Paul</a>), a semi-retired superhero turned mission coordinator, assigning heroes to crises based on their skills and (difficult) personalities, both with the promise of leveling up over time. Your squad of “heroes” is the Z-team in every sense. It’s a <a href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chaotic mix of washed-up villains no one expects to redeem</a>, each carrying enough emotional baggage to test the most seasoned therapist (caped or otherwise) a headache.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dispatch | Episodes 5 &amp; 6 Preview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zidpOy-Zta4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While <em>Dispatch</em>’s branching choices aren’t quite as splintered as the most procrastinated windshield spider cracks, it has already revived the lost art of player-driven internet chatter—debating everyone’s choices, overlooked details, and speculating on how the story might unfold in the remaining four episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Being on the ground floor of something gaming-related that’s tied to players’ choices, discussing them, and trying to figure out how they’ll play out as the entire story unfolds in semi-weekly releases allows for community-driven conversations without the frustration of an episodic narrative that’s incomplete. This way, we see the whole work as evolving, rather than judging it based on unfinished pieces, which often leads to tired debates about graphics instead of emotional storytelling and character banter that really tug at your heartstrings or make you laugh.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">She’s insecure without her powers without her necklace but Robert? Who’s almost a parallel to her? He likes both the hero she is and the human being that she is.

In <em>Dispatch</em>’s fandom, players feel less like rivals in a competitive arena and more like a community—eager to swap decisions, analyze tiny details, trade puzzle tips, and even talk about romance without feeling juvenile or ironic.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer"><h3>Nothing But Respect For This Manual Ear And Nose Hair Trimmer</h3></a><p>The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is a simple piece of metal that is leagues better than its flimsy, electric counterparts.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-cheap-indie-game-sale-roguelike-metroidvania-2000641389</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-most-underrated-roguelikes-of-the-past-6-years-is-just-3-on-switch-right-now.1344853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> came out <a href="https://kotaku.com/dicey-dungeons-is-a-good-entry-point-for-deck-builders-1837283279">way back in 2019</a>, a fact that blew my mind when I went to go double-check it today. That feels like a lifetime ago, but the deckbuilding roguelike itself still feels surprisingly fresh. Developed by Terry Cavanagh (<em>Super Hexagon</em>, <em>VVVVVV</em>), it combines two of my favorite things, turn-based combat and getting burned on RNG re-rolls, into a great dice battling game that too often goes overlooked. Somehow it’s currently just $3 on Switch.</p> <p>The premise is basically “what if you took a traditional turn-based dungeon game and ran every action through a jumble of chaos?” You collect equipment in the form of cards which dictate what actions you can take, and dice which are used to activate the cards. Some cards can only work with certain dice, and certain abilities will be stronger or weaker depending on the rolls you link them with. It’s a multi-layered math problem that sounds like homework in theory but is actually quite straightforward to navigate and slickly implemented in practice.</p>

 <p>There’s a bit of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, a bit of <em>Balatro</em>, and a whole lot of Cavanagh’s own clever design work going on. It’s not the only great Switch indie game on sale right now, though. A whole bunch of them are super cheap for the next week or so:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sifu</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>The Pathless</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Haiku, the Robot</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Ashen</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Gorogoa</em> – $4.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> – $6 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Blasphemous</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> – $3 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> – $7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Risk of Rain 2</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>I’ve already sung <em>Dicey Dungeons</em>‘ praises, but I want to give another special shoutout to <a href="https://kotaku.com/haiku-the-robot-hollow-knight-silksong-review-metroidva-1848910676"><em>Haiku, the Robot</em></a>. This is another one that was easy to miss when it came out a few years back. It’s a retro-styled Metroidvania that has some neat ideas but doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. There’s fun combat, some light platforming, and a great soundtrack. Plus a grappling hook. But it’s not an overwhelming maze or a gauntlet of brutal boss fights. It’s inspired by <em>Hollow Knight</em> but a much friendlier version of that formula, while still feeling authentic and charming. At just $4, it’s also a steal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-play-time-session-switch-3ds-wii-u-2000641372">Nintendo launched a new Store app</a> for mobile phones that lets you wishlist, search for, and buy Switch and Switch 2 games on your phone. And that’s neat, but uh, why is this a separate app? Why does Nintendo keep insisting that you need one app to listen to music, another one to handle parental controls, and yet a few more to buy games, get news, and manage your Switch 2 console? It’s getting ridiculous.</p> <p>On November 5, the Nintendo Store App was released on mobile phones, letting users check out the Switch and Switch 2 eShop and even dig into some really interesting playtime data that the Mario maker has been collecting for years. Yet, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/nintendo-co-ltd/id1062496488">it also means Nintendo now has five separate non-gaming apps</a>.</p>

 <ul> <li>Nintendo Switch App</li> <li>Nintendo Music App</li> <li>Nintendo Today!</li> <li>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls</li> <li>Nintendo Store App</li> </ul> <p>Want to see which of your friends are online or manage your screenshots? <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-app-update-screenshots-upload-qr-code-1851782946">Use the Switch mobile app</a>. Want to buy a Switch 2 game on your phone? Well, download the newly released store app and use that. Also, the store app just opens a browser when you try to buy a game, so it’s not even that useful. Want to manage your console’s parental controls? Guess what, buddy? Go download another app. Curious about any new Nintendo news or announcements today? Fuck you, go download yet another app. Perhaps you wish to enjoy some music from your favorite Switch game, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-music-app-update-nes-games-donkey-kong-1851786691">Oh, you already know what I’m going to tell you: Download another app</a>.</p>

 <p>It’s all so strange and unnecessary. All of these apps feel barebones and not very useful because individually, each one only offers a few options and features. I’d much rather have a single Nintendo Switch app on my phone that contains a store, a little news section, and a way to manage my console and friends list. Breaking that out across three apps is silly. I’d even shove the parental controls into the main Switch app, too. This is mostly how Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation handle it, though Sony and Microsoft <em>also</em> break out parental controls into separate apps like Nintendo.</p> <p>Anyway, I’m excited for Nintendo to announce another new app next year that lets me change the visual settings on my Switch 2 and then another app that lets me manage my saves. I want 18 different Nintendo apps that I bounce between by 2030!</p>

                <p>In 2010, Visceral Games and Electronic Arts unleashed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dantes-inferno/" data-ref-id="5000-40808">Dante's Inferno</a>, an action-adventure game that was their answer to God of War. The story was very loosely inspired by Dante Alighieri's classic text, The Divine Comedy, as Dante sought to retrieve the soul of his wife, Beatrice, from Hell while facing Lucifer and the forces of evil. Now, 15 years after the game's release, new details have emerged about the canceled sequel, Dante's Inferno 2: Purgatorio.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> has an extensive report about Purgatorio, which includes a comprehensive breakdown of the story. The follow-up was envisioned as the inverse of the first game, as Dante was meant to scale Mount Purgatory to reunite with Beatrice and reach the Garden of Eden on top. However, each layer of the mountain represented one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and Dante had to both purge himself of those sins and defeat the embodiment of each one.</p><p>Dante also would have found himself in the middle of a war between Heaven and Hell, which he inadvertently set off by allowing Lucifer to escape Hell and invade Purgatory. St. Lucia--Dante's guardian angel from the first game's DLC--and the poet Virgil would have returned to guide Dante on his journey. To reach his goal, Dante would have to defeat some lethal archangels who considered him to be their enemy.</p><p>Along the way, Dante would have reunited and reconciled with Beatrice and banished her evil side from her. Or at least that's what he thought he did. In the game's closing moments, Dante and Beatrice made it all the way to Heaven, just for the former to discover that Lucifer had tricked him again. Through Beatrice, Lucifer murders Dante and casts him all the way back down to Hell. The only hope that ending offered is the spirit of St. Lucia, who assures Dante that even his death was part of God's plan.</p><p>The proposed third game, Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso, would have brought the war between Heaven and Hell to Earth and introduced Dante and Beatrice's daughter, who would be among the mortal warriors who fight alongside angels to reclaim Heaven from Lucifer and save Beatrice. God's plan would have been revealed as a plot to tear down the unforgiving ritual of sending souls to Heaven or Hell and replace it with something more compassionate.</p><p>Unfortunately, these ideas will likely never see the light of day as a game. But it's an intriguing look at what could have been.</p>

The original Switch will continue to be sold, Nintendo confirmed, but the company will focus on the Switch 2 going ahead.</p><p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware," Nintendo said.</p><p>In total, Nintendo has sold 154.01 million Switch consoles worldwide through September 30, and that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">just 10,000 units short of passing the DS</a> to become Nintendo's best-selling platform of all time.</p><p>The Switch is still millions of units short of catching up to the PS2, which is the best-selling console of all time with an estimated 160 million units sold. At least one expert believes the Switch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">will not catch the PS2.</a></p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">raised prices on the original Switch and a variety of accessories</a> due in part to the impact of tariffs.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo is predicting to sell fewer Switch consoles than before. For the current fiscal year, Nintendo is now expecting to sell 4 million units, down from a previous prediction of 4.5 million. However, Nintendo is revising Switch game sales up from 105 million to 125 million.</p><p>For the Switch 2, meanwhile, Nintendo is raising projections from 15 million to 19 million for the current fiscal year. The Switch 2 has sold more than 10 million units worldwide, making it the fastest-selling Nintendo platform ever over its first four months.</p>

This positive word of mouth seems to be working, as developer AdHoc Studios has announced it has sold over 1 million copies of Dispatch within its first 10 days of launch.</p><p>The game, which stars <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s Aaron Paul as a down-on-his-luck former superhero working as a dispatcher for reformed supervillains, is created by former Telltale Games writers and sports a similar choice-driven narrative-focused format. Dispatch is an eight-episode adventure, with Episodes 5 and 6 dropping today (and every Wednesday). We still have to wait until next week’s finale to see how AdHoc sticks the landing, but Dispatch has garnered near-unanimous praise for its writing, story, character development, and performances from actors such as Laura Bailey, Jeffery Wright, and Erin Yvette, to famous content creators including Jacksepticeye, Joel Haver, and MoistCr1TiKaL. Its impressive sales numbers complement an overwhelmingly positive 93% critical rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dispatch/">Metacritic</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“It’s always a little strange when the numbers get so big you have to talk about them,” says Michael Choung, AdHoc Studio's CEO and executive producer, in a press release. “A week ago, we were just as thrilled watching Let's Plays and reaction videos. But milestones like this matter. They mean AdHoc will be able to make more story-driven episodic originals, and we hope it means it'll be easier for other devs to do the same. Hard to believe we’re only halfway done.”</p><p>Dispatch is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC for $29.99.

			<p>Starting tomorrow, Fortnite players will be able to jump into a new creative island made by Epic Games called Disneyland Game Rush. It's a limited-time creative island that includes seven mini games, each inspired by different famous Disneyland and Disney World attractions and rides as part of the 70th anniversary of Disneyland.</p>



<p>It's not the massive persistent universe that Fortnite and Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/">have been planning and working on for more than a year now</a>, but it's perhaps a small glimpse as to what that might look like, and from a technical standpoint, a big step forward towards creating the look of the Disney theme parks within Fortnite.</p>



<p>The seven mini-games include games based on newer attractions, like the Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Sneak Out! game, based on the Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Breakout ride, has you sneaking around and completing the mission without being caught. A Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown mini-game has you putting down as many Stormtroopers as possible.</p>



<p>However, for the big Disney parks fans, the more meaningful mini-games are likely the ones based on Disney parks classics, like the Space Mountain: Rocket Race mini-game, the Metterhorn: Slip-and-Climb mini-game, and the Haunted Mansion: Scavenger Haunt mini-game.</p>



<p>A report from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-disneyland-game-rush-is-an-incredibly-authentic-first-step-into-fortnite-for-disney-parks?utm_source=threads,twitter"> IGN includes some screenshots</a> of the game modes and what players can expect when they jump into the island once it is available to the public tomorrow, November 6, 2025.</p>

<p>According to an updated listing, The Legend of Zelda live-action film has started production. Previously, the Nintendo/Sony movie, based on the iconic franchise, was in pre-production and set to release in 2027.</p>



<p>The success of Nintendo’s film projects has only gained speed thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Super Mario Bros</a>. Movie in 2023. Its blockbuster sales at the Box Office proved that bringing iconic IPs to the screen can work if done well. Interestingly, the next project announced was a highly ambitious live-action adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Helmed by The Maze Runner’s Wes Ball, the film plans to release on May 7th, 2027. Casting has been done for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link and Zelda</a>, but not much else is known. Well, now we may be getting some more information soon, if the listing is correct.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a listing from ProductionList</a>, it says that Sony’s The Legend of Zelda is now in production. If true, this means that casting and crew have been assigned and filming has begun. The filming dates are from November 4th, 2025, to April 7th, 2026. As for where it’s set to film, the site lists Wellington, New Zealand. Wellington is a major hub for movies like Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, and King Kong, so it makes sense for The Legend of Zelda to be there.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Nintendo has not confirmed that filming has started, so take the news with a grain of salt until then. However, seeing as the world of Hyrule will likely spend some time in post-production for CGI and such, filming now makes sense. The film had already been delayed from March 2027 to May 2027. Coincidentally, the movie is being filmed during the 40th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda franchise. Perhaps we could see some set photos and maybe even a teaser in early 2026? We’ll have to wait and see for now!</p>



<p>What do you think of The Legend of Zelda starting filming? Do you think the series can work in live-action? Who’s your dream Ganondorf casting? Any game you hope it adapts?

This includes the full list of multiplayer maps, game modes, and operators available in Black Ops 7 before the launch of Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">For maps, Black Ops 7 launches with 18 multiplayer maps. This list consists of 16 core 6v6 maps, while the additional two are large-scale 20v20 maps designed for Black Ops 7's new Skirmish mode. Most of the maps are brand new, but the game does include a few popular remasters from Black Ops 2. The full list of launch maps can be seen below.</p>

This is a variant of Treyarch's iconic Nuketown map, which is reimagined with the aesthetics of a near-future design. Nuketown 2025 is not available at launch, but it will arrive before the start of Black Ops 7's first season of content.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 12 game modes confirmed for launch, and these are featured for the game's standard core and hardcore playlists. Many of the modes are Call of Duty staples, such as Team Deathmatch, Domination, Search and Destroy, and Hardpoint. However, Black Ops 7 does introduce the 20v20 objective-based Skirmish mode and the new Overload mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Overload is a 6v6 respawn mode that tasks teams with fighting to gain possession of an overload device. Overload begins with players rushing to grab the overload device. Once they have it, the team possessing it must protect the carrier as they attempt to bring it to a designated zone. Overload is a back-and-forth game of attack and defend, and this is also the new competitive game mode for the Call of Duty League.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All MP game modes at launch:</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Overload</li><li dir="ltr">Team Deathmatch</li><li dir="ltr">Domination</li><li dir="ltr">Search and Destroy</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Confirmed</li><li dir="ltr">Free-for-All</li><li dir="ltr">Hardpoint</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Order</li><li dir="ltr">Control</li><li dir="ltr">Face Off Moshpit</li><li dir="ltr">Skirmish (20v20)</li><li dir="ltr">Gunfight (2v2)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 operators</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has 24 playable operators, but not all of them are available right away.
