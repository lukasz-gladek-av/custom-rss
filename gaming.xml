		<p>Metal Slug Tactics has got a release date, and that date is November 5th. Dotemu confirmed the news with a brand new trailer, that also revealed three more playable characters. Those characters are the Ikari Warriors, Clark Still, Ralf Jones, and Leona Heidern. You can check out the new Metal Slug Tactics trailer below, which shows the characters in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYLtBnTjdvk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There has been a bit of a wait for Metal Slug Tactics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/11/metal-slug-tactics-is-a-tactical-rpg-spin-off-from-the-classic-run-and-gun-shooter/">which was first revealed in 2021</a>. In 2022, developer<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/metal-slug-tactics-developer-acquired-by-focus/"> Leikir Studio was acquired by Focus Home Interactive</a>. Later in 2022, there was more news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/12/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-to-2023/">Metal Slug Tactics was going to be delayed to 202</a>3. Obviously, the game did not release in that year either, but at least it is coming out before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Descriptions for the new characters have been released alongside the trailer too, giving a sense of each one’s playstyle:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Clark Still:</b>&nbsp;Originally hailing from the Ikari Warriors series and previously playable in&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Clark’s immense strength and wrestling experience allows this tanklike ally to relocate enemies on the map and dish out wide-reaching, status-inflicting damage.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Ralf Jones:</b>&nbsp;Also returning for battle from the Ikari Warriors series and&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Ralf is a master of short-range combat, packing devastating punches and the ability to charge at enemies head-on like a raging bull.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Leona Heidern:</b>&nbsp;A newer addition to the Ikari Warriors, Leona is a revered fighter capable of replacing fallen enemies with decoy allies; she can distract and overwhelm enemy forces in her distinct approach to dominating the combat zone.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, Metal Slug Tactics is taking things in a bold new direction. It may feature the same heroes, visuals, and imagery of SNKs arcade classics, albeit from a new perspective. We’re suckers for turn-based tactical RPGs here at TheSixthAxis and, beyond the Metal Slug name, we want to see the milieu of customisation and roguelike elements that are at play when Tactics launches on November 5th for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Switch.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shotgun-king-is-roguelike-chess-with-a-shotgun">Shotgun King</a> developers Punkcake Délicieux have quietly rolled out another ticklish oddity in the shape of Build The Sun, a work-in-progress 2D god sim. In Build The Sun you preside over a tribe of alarming yet cute inkblot creatures, who sometimes remind me of Pikmin and sometimes, of that awful 'roided-up panther monster from the opening stretch of Another World. Your objective is, indeed, to build the sun, because there isn't one: the game's pastoral pixelart world is engulfed in darkness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It starts with a single, scurrying inkblot creature, hefting a solitary flame through the shadows. Who lit that first flame? Does this world have a Prometheus? There is no time to ponder, for a helpful arrow ushers you toward a ready-made pile of sticks. 
</p>
<p>
Hold-click on the pile to ignite it (make sure you actually hold till the fire is ablaze, as the current version of the game will crash otherwise). Now, you have a small circle of light that attracts other inkblot creatures. The fire craves growth, as advertised by silhouetted icons for burnable resources when you mouse-over the blaze. These can be obtained by hold-clicking on things like trees and rocks, causing your industrious followers to automatically cluster and nibble the object down to its rudiments.
</p>
<p>
As the fire develops, spilling the light further and further, the game gets more complex. You don't have to burn all the resources you gather; you can use them to construct things like huts and windmills. I'm not sure what these buildings do yet, after 15 minutes with the current build, but I imagine huts increase your population. Everything is left for you to figure out - there's no guidance beyond the silhouetted icons. It appears there's plenty to discover, or at least, that the process of feeding the conflagration is compulsive. Commenters on <a href="https://punkcake.itch.io/build-the-sun">the Itch.io downloads page</a> say they've been tending to their miniature suns for hours.
</p><p>
The current version of Build The Sun is one of many fruits of <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56">Ludum Dare's 56th gamejam</a>. It was made in 72 hours according to the theme "tiny creatures". "We're definitely going to keep working on this one, so you may also consider this version as a very early demo," the devs note. I wish them all the best with it. I have a thing for weird sun-themed games. If you share that fetish, may I also recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a>?

As a high-tech thriller, the game required a musical score that evoked the science of expert intelligence gathering – and that approach began with the opening cinema. While this prologue sequence focused on the news and popular sentiment surrounding events in recent history, I wanted my score to emphasize technology, so I prepared some satellite telemetry and data entry sounds that I could use during composition:</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7l85AXfC--g" height="nullpx" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s see how that worked in the cinema:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIHsygEcsPc" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a somewhat understated use of science sound design, so let’s now check out a more overt example. In the Spyder video game for Apple Arcade, developer Sumo Digital created an over-the-top 1960s spy adventure starring a tiny robotic spider. Creative direction for the sound of this game included a groovy 60s-style spy score and lots of retro futuristic sound design, so I made extra efforts to inject that famously quirky sixties sci-fi audio palette into my musical compositions:</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/gdc-2024-dial-up-the-diegetics-the-animal-kingdom" target="_self">GDC 2024 Dial Up the Diegetics: The Animal Kingdom</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKBMZSvkXZc" height="300px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were lots of opportunities to spotlight this sound design approach in my score for Spyder.

The Fail Factory VR game from Armature Studio dropped players into the roles of interns manning an out-of-control robot assembly line. It was my job to make the situation feel as comedically hectic as possible. So, along with a peppy jazz style, I absolutely jammed my music full of robot factory sound design. Here’s a taste of some of the sound assets I was using in this project – these were meant to give the impression of “electronics run amok.”:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0X1fAqsBg5g" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can see that, unlike the sound effects I used in Spyder and Shattered State, these sounds for Fail Factory are particularly aggressive and strident.

So, let’s start small and work our way up!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Industrial and mechanical diegetics">Industrial and mechanical diegetics</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In The Da Vinci Code video game, The Collective and 2K Games adapted the world-famous novel in which a Harvard professor uncovers an ancient mystery by solving intricate puzzles.

<p>The Ultimate Sparking Zero - Graphic Mod, which can be downloaded right now from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonballsparkingzero/mods/149?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces more detailed shadows and textures, better lighting, better anti-aliasing, improved view distance and foliage distance, reduced input latency, as well as SSGI and ray tracing. While the differences aren't massive, they do make a difference and definitely improve the game's visuals, as highlighted in the screenshots and videos below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that there won't be a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em>data update for the 2024/25 season ahead of the release of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1848709640751927326" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the two studios say that although they've been "exploring" the possibility of an update for the existing game, implementing such a thing would be a "substantial undertaking" which would divert "critical resources" from&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially, the studios say it would be impossible to "lift assets" being used in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>and drop them into&nbsp;<em>FM24&nbsp;</em>"without recreating them in full". Since&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>will contain data from the 2024/25 season, the studios would have to recreate that data within&nbsp;<em>FM24</em>'s engine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25-menus.jpg?itok=JicnpJtr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25-menus.jpg?itok=TSbLvbBN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect this screen to show up-to-date info for the 2024/25 season.</figcaption></figure><p>The same logic applies to "the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported", owing to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will sport (no pun intended) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">an entirely new engine</a>.</p>
<p>Updated assets and data would "both be required to obtain licensor approval", Sports Interactive and Sega say, and despite "a good initial response" from many licensors, the work involved seems like it would simply be too much.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date">intended for launch next month</a>, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025">delayed to 2025</a> after what Sports Interactive called a "difficult development cycle".</p>
<p>The game will boast a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">Premier League license</a> for the first time in the series' history, but it will compromise on various <i>Football Manager&nbsp;</i>mainstay features, including Create-a-Club and other core series mechanics.</p>

<p><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is now scheduled to launch in March, but since that date is fairly close to the end of the 2024/25 football (sorry, Americans) season, some fans have been asking after a season update for the existing game to tide them over.</p>
<p>Sadly, it looks like that won't be happening. If you want to see current data, you'll have to wait for&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, which is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010715" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/football-manager-25-console/9NQ4K2ZW5HJV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in March 2025, with versions for the Switch and mobile devices to follow after.</p>

First <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">reported in <em>Game File</em></a> and confirmed by Netflix, the streaming company has quietly closed of one of its studios, the first in the three years since the company began its foray into gaming.</p><p>According to <em>Game File</em>, the shuttered studio was known as Blue. In 2022, Netflix announced it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23411684/netflix-cloud-gaming-studio-pc-tv">hired former <em>Overwatch </em>executive producer Chacko Sonny</a> to run the studio. Since then, Blue had brought on a number of game industry veterans with experience working on high profile franchises including<em> Halo </em>and <em>God of War</em>. Reportedly, Blue was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23686693/netflix-joseph-staten-aaa-game-halo-veteran">developing a multi-platform AAA game for an original IP</a> but was closed before the game could be announced or released.</p><p>Netflix has released a steady stream of games on its platform since the beginning of its gaming experiment in 2021. Though it started with a small handful of hyper-casual mobile games, Netflix’s offerings have expanded to include mobile exclusive ports of iconic games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091183/netflix-games-hades-release-date-ios-march"><em>Hades</em></a> its own internally developed exclusives like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163281/cozy-grove-camp-spirit-release-date-netflix-gaming"><em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23787249/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-netflix-playstation-switch"><em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</em></a>.</p><p>Netflix has also acquired or spun-up a number of studios to support its gaming pipeline. The most recent additions were a mobile game studio in Helsinki, a new studio in southern California, and <em>Cozy Grove </em>developer Spry Fox. But with the closure of Blue, Netflix’s trend of expansion may be over as well as its grander AAA ambitions.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273820/intuit-ceo-sasan-goodarzi-turbotax-irs-quickbooks-ai-software-decoder-interview"><h2>Intuit asked us to delete part of this Decoder episode</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview"><h2>Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275797/ford-mustang-mache-2025-heat-pump-bluecruise-design"><h2>The 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E gets sportier and more affordable</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo"><h2>Nintendo’s mysterious Playtest begins to leak</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/20/24274915/alien-romulus-vhs-limited-edition-collectible-release-date"><h2>Alien: Romulus is getting a VHS release</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake's Biggest Differences</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Labyrinth is an underground maze of hallways located beneath Toluca Prison. Players will bump into several NPCs while exploring it (including Eddie and Angela), and will also be faced with a couple of boss fights. The Labyrinth also contains a few puzzles for players to solve, and these puzzles are where the problem lies. Upon completing a puzzle that involves rotating a cube, the cube will then disintegrate, allowing players to continue their journey. But as of the 1.04 patch, the cube is no longer disintegrating for some players, leaving them unable to progress.</p><p dir="ltr">On the bright side, Konami and Bloober Team are aware of the issue, and the game's developers have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1g9ei4w/bloober_are_working_on_the_labyrinth_bug_fix/" rel="nofollow ">added an in-game notification</a> confirming that a fix is on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are aware of an issue some players may encounter after the most recent 1.04 patch released on October the 21st in the Labyrinth level of Silent Hill 2," the announcement reads. "The fix will be released as soon as possible. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience."</p><p dir="ltr">But for players who don't want to wait for an official fix, a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1g8xo92/sh2_remake_game_breaking_bug_in_labyrinth_need_a/" rel="nofollow ">post on the game's Steam page</a> lists some possible solutions that range from simply reloading the game to lowering its frame rate. None of them are guaranteed to work, of course, but for now, they're the only solution for players who are eager to continue their trek through Silent Hill's blood-splattered hallways and foggy streets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/microsoft-reveal-upgraded-xbox-wireless-headset/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has unveiled an upgraded version of the Xbox Wireless Headset, bringing a handful of key improvements with longer battery life, an upgraded microphone and more.</p>
<p>The new Xbox Wireless Headset is available today for $110 / £100 and regional equivalent pricing – that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/16/xbox-wireless-headset-pre-order-price-release-date-march/">a notable $10 / £5 price jump</a> over the original headset, but there’s actually a good reason for that, as Dolby Atmos is now included without an additional fee (previously an additional £11/$15 purchase)</p>


<p>At a glance, they’re effectively identical to the original headset, just without the Xbox green rims to the ear cups. There’s now a single green nubbin button on the otherwise all-black exterior. Most of the changes have come on the inside, though.</p>
<p>Battery life now gives up to 20 hours of playtime between charges, there’s an upgraded microphone with enhanced auto-mute and voice isolations, and the headset now features Bluetooth 5.3 for connection to PC and mobile devices. Qualcomm S5 Gen 2 tech has also been integrated for lower latency.</p>
<p>As mentioned, premium spatial audio is no longer an additional purchase, with Windows Sonic still a freebie, Dolby Atmos now included at no extra cost, and support for DTS Headphone:X, which is still a separate purchase.</p>

<p>The original Xbox Wireless Headset launched in 2021, and was an immediate favourite of ours – some disliked the audio balance and got to tweaking the output, but it worked perfectly for us. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/26/xbox-wireless-headset-review/">our 2021 headset review</a>, Dom said, “The Xbox Wireless Headset is a remarkable feat of engineering, providing a smart and solid build as well as top-notch audio and comfort that are a rare commodity at this price point.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that this one’s even better.</p>

			<p>A new Alan Wake 2 update went live today, introducing new accessibility options, PS5 Pro support, Xbox Series S improvement, and more.</p>
<p>The October 22nd update is meant to celebrate the game's first anniversary by introducing new features and improvements even for those who have not purchased the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Lake House expansion, also released today. Among the biggest changes introduced in the update are new accessibility options, which include infinite ammo and batteries, immortality, options to change button holds into taps, and more.</p>
<p>The new Alan Wake 2 Anniversary Update also adds, as already mentioned, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">PS5 Pro support</a>, optional support for Motion Sensor controls with a DualSense controller on PC and PlayStation 5, refined and additional haptics, and an increased internal render resolution on Xbox Series X, from 1280x720 to 1505x847. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot32-mythologies-histories-prophecies.970347/post-130495653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the beginning</a>, it seemed like the update also added VRR support on Xbox consoles, but the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">current patch</a> notes do not mention it anymore so it's not clear if this has been indeed added or not.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.

It'll be on around the same scale as previous Immersion Packs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/victoria-3-getting-immersion-pack-voice-of-people-next-month">like <em>Voice of the People</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested, the title of the DLC comes from a quote by former Viceroy of India Victor Bruce, who described India as the titular "pivot of our Empire", lamenting that "if [the British Empire loses] India, the sun of our Empire will have set".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new Harvest and Famines mechanics, which will allow you to "secure India's food supply" and take "advantage of the unique events and narrative content", as well as a new art style with a brand new map inspired by Indian culture.</p>
<p>While this DLC isn't on the same level as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Sphere of Influence</em>, it should still be a pretty substantial addition to what is already a frankly massive grand strategy game.</p>

<p>The new DLC pack will arrive alongside the free 1.8 update, which is set to bring various improvements to&nbsp;<em>Victoria 3&nbsp;</em>including new national and religious movements, company building ownership, the Indian caste system, and more.</p>
<p><em>Victoria 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018, Nintendo invited me to a meeting in New York City to see a mysterious new initiative. It was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900412/nintendo-switch-interactive-experience-feature-announcement">teased as</a> an “interactive experience for Nintendo Switch,” which sent my mind to all sorts of places. This is the company that made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a weird dual-screen Game Boy</a> and <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/DK_Bongos">bongo controllers</a>, after all. It could be anything. Even still, I did not guess that I would spend that meeting folding bits of cardboard — or that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy">those cardboard accessories would turn out to be so awesome</a>. That was the moment I completely gave up on trying to guess what Nintendo would do next.</p><p>That meeting has been on my mind quite a bit over the last few weeks. While much of the game industry has been on edge in anticipation of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">whatever the follow-up to the Switch will be</a>, Nintendo has focused on pretty much anything and everything else. </p><div><p>Last month, I went to visit the company in Kyoto, but not to see new hardware; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">instead, I went on a tour of the just-opened Nintendo Museum</a>. This month, Nintendo did announce a new gadget, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">instead of a console, it was an alarm clock</a>. And just this week, details started trickling out about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266478/nintendo-switch-online-invite-application-beta-playtest">the company’s secretive online test</a>, which some predicted would provide hints at the Switch 2. Nope: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">instead, it seems to be an online game in the vein of <em>Minecraft</em></a>. Three big moments, zero Switch successors.</p></div><p>This isn’t new, of course. Nintendo generally goes its own way. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21534306/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-guide-games-review">Sony and Microsoft ushered in the current generation of consoles</a>, Nintendo launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles">a new version of the Game &amp; Watch</a>, an LCD handheld from the ’80s. But the rapid succession of announcements and reveals from the company over the last few weeks has been surprising and indicative of its idiosyncratic nature. And while it might seem random, the weeks full of museum openings and alarm clock launches are likely part of a very calculated strategy.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It could mean a few things. Maybe Nintendo is clearing the runway to keep the focus on the Switch 2 whenever it does decide to announce it. In the Switch era, Nintendo has become much more adept at clear messaging, which hasn’t always been the case. Just think back to when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/6/7/2515106/nintendo-wii-u-announced">the Wii U was first announced</a>, and some (myself included) initially confused it for a Wii accessory. So it makes a lot of sense to get this other stuff out of the way before the next console. Nintendo Direct presentations have become huge moments, and the one dedicated to the next console will possibly be the biggest to date. You don’t want to mess that up.</p><p>It could also be an indication of where Nintendo is right now. This is a company that doesn’t want to be only known for games. <em>Super Mario</em> creator Shigeru Miyamoto said as much when I was in Kyoto in September. “A lot of people may see Nintendo as a video game company,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">he explained during a press conference</a>. “But what I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company.” While it’s been building a new console in secret and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24258654/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-edit-dungeons-links-awakening">sending out its current one on a high note</a>, it has also been branching out in new directions.</p><div><p>That includes bringing Nintendo experiences into the real world through a theme park partnership with Universal — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">an initiative so important that Miyamoto has played a major role</a> — and a (so far) successful jump into feature films with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, created by <em>Minions</em> studio Illumination. It’s relatively early days, but the company is using its long-running success in games to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">transform into an entertainment empire</a>. Which is to say, Nintendo has a lot more irons in the fire than <em>just</em> a new console. Maybe we’ll get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951339/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-nintendo">a live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie trailer</a> before we see the Switch 2.</p></div><p>Doing things differently isn’t always a guarantee of success, of course, and Nintendo has certainly had its share of failures. These glory days of the Switch, <em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">Super Nintendo World</a> famously happened in the aftermath of the Wii U, Nintendo’s worst-selling home console to date. It took 30 years for the company to follow up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">the infamous original <em>Mario</em> movie flop</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">a billion-dollar film</a>. The industry ebbs and flows, and it only takes one console generation to move from the top of the market to the bottom. That only makes it harder to predict what Nintendo will do; I certainly would have never guessed the Switch was its next system back in 2017 or that it would go on to outsell the Wii and Game Boy.</p><p>This is all a long way of saying that, just like when I sat down in front of some stacks of cardboard in New York, I am currently at a loss trying to figure out what Nintendo’s execs are thinking. I have some ideas, of course, helped along by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">a steady stream of rumors</a>, but no real sense of what the company’s next console will look like or when it will be announced. All I know for sure is that it won’t be boring. But if it is? That’d be another big surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Netflix have shut down one of their more trumpeted video game initiatives - a Californian studio known as team "Blue" and stocked with former Halo, God Of War and Overwatch developers. It was a major plank in Netflix's on-going efforts to extend their film and TV streaming empire to what Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactive-fail-to-mention-if-a-potential-project-007-trilogy-will-feature-hitmans-glorious-queues-so-whos-to-say-whether-its-worth-my-time">insists on calling the "greasy screen"</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>The news comes via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">Gamefile</a> and Stephen Totillo, who cites a company representative. Netflix have yet to make a formal announcement. Team Blue's members included former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny and former God Of War art director Rafael Grassetti. According to Joseph Staten - an original Halo developer who joined Team Blue in April 2023 after helping 343 Industries polish off Halo Infinite - they were working on "a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP". </p>
<p>Netflix have been trying to establish themselves as a gaming publisher and platform since around the turn of the decade. They began stocking mobile games on their store in 2021, and have splurged on a few studio purchases - Oxenfree 2 devs Night School Studio in 2021, then Next Games and Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022. In 2022, it also emerged that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-are-developing-a-aaa-pc-game-with-no-microtransactions">hiring in Los Angeles to develop a triple-A PC game</a>. </p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-are-testing-their-own-game-streaming-service">trialled game streaming in August 2023</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-has-reportedly-spoken-with-rockstar-about-releasing-a-grand-theft-auto-game-as-the-streaming-giant-plans-to-add-higher-end-games-to-its-library">approached Rockstar about bringing GTA to Netflix</a> (you can now find the Grand Theft Auto Trilogy on the service). As of July 2024, Netflix Games had over 80 games in development, with around 100 available already. Whether they are seeing returns on all this investment is another question. Also in July 2024, co-CEO and president Gregory K Peters <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-has-80-games-in-development-and-plans-to-release-about-one-new-title-per-month">conceded</a> that engagement with games on Netflix remains "quite small".</p><p>As Kotaku's John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">observes</a>, the closure of Team Blue isn't wholly surprising. Netflix do not have much experience of founding and running their own game development teams, and "AAA" multiplatform originals crafted by seasoned blockbuster devs are pricey - the kind of prestige item you get rid of when ol' Mr Projected Profit Curve starts to look worryingly horizontal.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Grassetti, Staten and Sonny get up to now. Given their credits, I'm fairly sure they'll land on their feet. I wish any less established former Team Blue developers the best of luck finding new work. As for Netflix Games as a whole, I don't get the sense that they have much vision beyond "video games now make more money than film and we want a piece of the pie".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At first glance, you would be forgiven for assuming the all-new Xbox Wireless Headset, announced by Microsoft recently, is the same as the old model. On the surface, it is. But underneath, there are a few enhancements and additions that may appear enticing to someone in the market for a new headset or an audiophile. Here’s everything new about the Xbox Wireless Headset.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-about-the-xbox-wireless-headset">Everything New About the Xbox Wireless Headset</h2>



<p>For its price tag, the all-new Xbox Wireless Headset isn’t wholly new. It’s an improved version of the last-generation headset, which means it’s not worth the price tag to some. Others, however, will note the enhancements below and find themselves overly excited about a new piece of technology!</p>



<ul>
<li>Dolby Atmos (free)</li>



<li>Improved battery life, allowing up to 20 hours of continuous playtime</li>



<li>Enhanced microphone with auto-mute and voice isolation features</li>



<li>Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, it should be noted that many within the announcement’s comments profess their love for the previous editions of the Xbox Wireless Headset. But there are criticisms. Some claim the microphone snapped off on their old headset, and others claim the sound design is weak. The inclusion of Dolby Atmos should resolve the latter issue, but we cannot confirm either way for the microphone snapping off.</p>



<p>While not a new feature, the ability to tweak and fine-tune your headset is definitely welcome. Too many headsets these days are plug-and-play affairs, and everyone is unique, so the Xbox Accessories app’s customization suite is welcome.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-much-does-the-xbox-wireless-headset-cost">How Much Does the Xbox Wireless Headset Cost?</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in purchasing the Xbox Wireless Headset, you’ll need to pay $109.99 plus shipping and handling during checkout and the usual taxes. In total, I would expect to pay around $150, but it depends on your region and location.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-buy-the-xbox-wireless-headset">Where to Buy the Xbox Wireless Headset</h2>



<p>Currently, the best place to order the new Xbox Wireless Headset is via the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox accessories website</a>. According to Microsoft, the headset will also be available at local retailers, such as Best Buy or GameStop, so check your nearby shops soon for the headset!</p>



<p>Is the new Xbox Wireless Headset on your radar, or do you have a trusted brand you’ll stick with? I tend to use Corsair, but I’m open to new headsets from others.

            <p>Sports Interactive has released a statement explaining why Football Manager 24 won't receive a current season update, following the delay of Football Manager 25.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-25-release-delayed-until-march-2025">announced Football Manager 25 would miss its original release next month</a> and instead will launch in March 2025 to "ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards".</p>
<p>Since then, fans had called for a current season update to FM24, something the developer has now said it had been "exploring since the initial internal conversation about postponing the game's release". However, assets from the next game cannot be "back ported".</p>

<p>"Having now scoped the work that would be required, and despite a good initial response from many of our licensors, we cannot lift assets that we are using in FM25 and make them work in FM24 without recreating them in full," a statement from Sports Interactive reads.</p>
<p>"The same applies to the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported. The updated assets and data would both be required to obtain licensor approval - they cannot be separated.</p>
<p>"This is a substantial undertaking which would take critical resources away from delivering FM25 to the highest possible quality, which we simply cannot compromise on."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>In its previous statement concerning the delay, Sports Interactive described FM25 as "the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation" and acknowledged it "cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history".</p>
<p>The March release for FM25 will be across all platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>"It's been a difficult year," boss of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">Sports Interactive Miles Jacobson told Eurogamer</a> in September. "[But] it's been a great learning experience!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft has revealed its updated Xbox Wireless Headset, which now includes Dolby Atmos "at no extra cost". 
</p>
<p>
Designed to be comfier, with longer battery life and improved spatial sound, the new Xbox Wireless Headset replaces the previous model.
</p>
<p>
This fresh version of the Bluetooth Xbox Wireless Headset now boasts 20 hours of battery life, auto-mute and voice isolation for its microphone, and built-in support for Dolby Atmos, Windows Sonic and DTS Headphone:X.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Microsoft's fresh model is available to buy now, priced £100 or $110.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Tempted? It's already up for purchase on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset">Microsoft Store</a> here in the UK if so, though other reputable retailers will also undoubtedly be available.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/netflix-closes-its-aaa-team-blue-studio/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Netflix has closed down its Southern California game studio, known as Team Blue, with the streaming giant seemingly reassessing the most ambitious part of its gaming strategy, if not the wider plan.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">Game File</a>, Team Blue was reportedly charged with making AAA games, and Netflix had made some significant hires to that end, with former Overwatch producer Chacko Sonny, Halo co-creator Joseph Staten, and Sony Santa Monica’s art director Rafael Grassetti, having all been lured to the promise of whatever Netflix had planned.</p>


<p>The closure will naturally affect all of the staff at Team Blue and lead to the cancellation of projects, though these were reportedly still only in the early stages of development – the aforementioned trio joined in late 2022 and early 2023.</p>
<p>They still have their Helsinki-based studio, Texas-based mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, as well as Oxenfree develoer Night School Studio and Cozy Grove devs Spry Fox. It was reported this summer that they had <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/netflix-video-games-80-in-development/">more than 80 games in development</a> with both owned studios and external partners.</p>

<p>Team Blue was a bit of an outlier to Netflix’s broader strategy of creating tie ins to their TV series and filling out a library of smaller, predominantly mobile games to fill out a library of distractions for their main TV subscription. Yes, that has included things like Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, Queens Gambit and other tie-ins, but there’s also the GTA remaster trilogy, World of Goo and plenty others.</p>

			<p>If you've been hoping for <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a> to experience some horror this season, then you won't have to wait much longer. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has paired up with Fun World to introduce <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204800/Hunt_Showdown_1896__Ghost_Face_Rampage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Face</a>, the iconic killer from the slasher movie Scream, to the world of Hunt. The Ghost Face Rampage DLC comes with a couple of items that will make your game a lot of fun, including Ghost Face as a new Hunter. There are also two weapons and a tool that comes with the DLC. This includes the Hush, which is a Frontier 73C Silencer, Whisper, a Bornheim No. 3 Silencer and Life Taker, which is a knife.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost Face® Rampage | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_jvzit55Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As stated in the name of the weapons, they are completely silent, which offers players the opportunity to be a real danger on the battlefield and the opportunity to assassinate other players in close-quarter combat, as well as get some shots in from a distance with the Silencers.</p>
<p>For those who want the opportunity to try out this fun collaboration, the Ghost Face Rampage DLC will be available for $9.99 and will be available via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 as of October 24, 2024. To make sure Ghost Face didn't stick out like a sore thumb, he received a new design that allowed him to fit into the world of Hunt: Showdown 1896. Stefan Heinrich, Lead Art Director had this to say about the creation of Ghost Face:</p>
<p>"The character design was interesting to work on as it had to fit into the gritty, dark corners of the 1890s setting that Hunt is famous for. For example, the iconic mask is now a hand-carved wooded mask, weathered and cracked, a tattered battle worn duster replaces the robe and to complete the look, leather holsters and gear have been added, giving him the tools of a 19th Century Hunter while maintaining his iconic style."</p>
<p>There have been plenty of collaborations over the years of Hunt, and this is the first horror collaboration for Hunt: Showdown 1896, and will also be accompanied by an in-game event named Harvest of Ghosts which will be live until 25 November, 2024.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about the DLC and the event, make sure to check out the trailer, which is just over a minute long, to get more details on what you can expect from the Ghost Face Rampage DLC for Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-finally-revealed-for-november.1016244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leikir Studio and publisher Dotemu have announced the&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>release date, so we finally know when they're bringing the long-awaited strategy RPG to PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1590760/view/4513261623769734603" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on November 5th, so you won't have much longer to wait if you've been eagerly anticipating the game for a while.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/all-of-summer-game-fest-2021-announcements">2021 Summer Game Fest celebration</a>, and it was originally intended for launch in 2022 before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-until-2023">delayed to 2023</a>. Naturally, it was then delayed further, so it's nice that the release date has been announced at last.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=cC1SfEy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=9I_XybNc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has the release date been revealed, but it turns out that <i>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</i>is getting a fun little cameo at launch in the form of three characters from the&nbsp;<em>Ikari Warriors</em> (and, by extension,&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters</em>)&nbsp;series.</p>
<p>Clark Still, Ralf Jones, and Leona Heidern will be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, two of them returning from making cameos in previous&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>titles. Leona was first introduced in 1996 fighting game&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters '96</em>.</p>
<p>They'll each have a different special power to offer: Clark has "immense strength", Ralf uses "fiery punches" to attack his opponents, and Leona can "replace fallen enemies with decoy afterimages".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, it is, believe it or not, a tactical RPG spinoff of the&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>series. Rather than the frantic run-and-gun action of the main franchise,&nbsp;<em>Tactics&nbsp;</em>will offer a more thoughtful and considered gameplay style.</p>
<p>The game will feature a host of hand-crafted maps across its campaign, as well as "die-and-retry roguelite progression", lots of weapons and mods to choose from, and several iconic&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>characters for your army.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009982" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Metal-Slug-Tactics-2018254.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on November 5th.</p>

The channel’s final video went up today, and Sakurai capped it off with two surprise announcements. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,194842,197298" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The first unexpected reveal was that the content for his channel was almost all created at the start. The Sakurai that many fans thought they were seeing in each new video was actually from the past, as the videos were shot years ago. That Christopher Nolan-esque twist kicked off a final video for the channel dedicated to how it was made and what the famed game director plans to do now. Not surprisingly, it includes going back to making them.</p><p>Sakurai’s second reveal was that he had been pitching a new project back when the channel first started. The time jump means that, assuming the pitch got greenlit, the director’s new game might be ready for an official announcement not too far in the future. Whether it’s a game in the mold of <em>Smash Bros.</em> or something completely different, and whether it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">for the Switch 2</a></span> or another platform entirely, remains to be seen. </p><p>“I received a request to write a game proposal, which I finished at lightning speed,” he said in the final video. “I’m sorry I can’t share more about this project, but assuming we’re able to get it made, it should be announced sooner or later.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the video, Sakurai shared a detailed look at how he organizes his day, plans out his official work and side hustles, and even when he goes to bed and how much sleep he gets (only about six hours on average). He also included some interesting stats about production costs and channel milestones. Sakurai estimated it cost about $600,000 to get all of the channel’s content edited and translated, as well as pay licensing fees for certain footage and crossover episodes with other companies. Had he billed himself for all of his own work and time scripting everything, the costs would have been even higher. But Sakurai confirmed it was all in service of an educational channel that he didn’t make any money from. </p><p>“It really was a silly decision,” he said. “However, and I truly mean this, I consider this an investment toward a brighter future for games.” He continued, “The world is constantly seeing new game releases. Lots of people are doing their best out there. Rather than add one more title to that deluge, I thought the channel might give all games a little quality boost and I hope from the bottom of my heart that I’ve contributed at least a bit of wind to the industry sails.”</p><p>In total, Sakurai released 260 videos, over 19 hours of content, with over 80 million views across it all, totaling 498 years of watch time. His Japanese and English language channels have over a million subscribers combined. Unfortunately, he also points out that given the “volatility” of the YouTube algorithm, there’s no telling when his videos will stop getting recommended and fade into the content background radiation of the rest of the platform. For now though, it sounds like the<em> Smash Bros.</em> icon will have more to share about his future game projects soon. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As such, finding meaningful negative reviews so we can cover all perspectives was challenging!

They praise Bloober Team’s remake on all fronts, indicating a worthy continuation and rebirth for the long-silent franchise.</p><p>Looking at the positive user reviews for <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, we can see that most players finish a single playthrough, at the very least, though most wind up with two or three under their belts. They point toward the occasional stuttering issue, but primarily the faithful recreation of the original, the superb voice acting, and improved combat mechanics that make the game feel more modern and alive. It’s a tense and frantic experience, and it seems to resonate with most people. Of course, there are even more positive reviews begging for Bloober Team to tackle the other <em>Silent Hill </em>titles, and after this game’s success, that’s a distinct possibility.</p><p>Whether you’re on the fence or want to satisfy confirmation bias, here is <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, as told by Steam reviews:</p><figure id="" data-id="1c855029b31d384b2795df7f6b2a1df1"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to debut a whole heap of new Mastery Camos and bonus Camos to attain. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears are required to unlock them, so read on for full details about BLOPS 6’s extensive list of unlockable Camos.</p>



<p>Camos don’t just make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-launch-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a> look pretty, they provide an added layer of challenge to an already intense online multiplayer experience. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> not only brings back the classic Prestige System to make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveling up</a> more fun, but it comes equipped with a backpack overflowing with creative and colorful Camos. </p>



<p>You’re dying to know about the Mastery Camos, I can feel it, and I’m going to delve into Black Ops 6’s most elite Camos, along with everything else you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-mastery-camos-explained">Black Ops 6 Mastery Camos, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hours of content lie in wait. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Mastery Camos—and Camos in general—are <strong>special weapon skins unlocked by completing challenges and meeting requirements</strong>—such as getting a certain amount of headshots.</p>



<p>The Camo system has been a staple of the Call of Duty franchise dating back to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare where you needed to score headshots to unlock Blue Tiger, Red Tiger, and eventually Gold Camo. Fast forward to recent CoD games, and there are dozens, dare I say hundreds—of unlockable Camos to grind toward now.</p>



<p>The most coveted of all though is Mastery Camos—and they are the best of the best; requiring a lot of time and effort to obtain. I’m going to explain each set of Camos in Black Ops 6 and how to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-6-camos-and-how-to-unlock-them">All Black Ops 6 Camos and How to Unlock Them</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-progression-leveling-prestiging-challenges-intel#weapon-camos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision has explained</a> each weapon is broken up into three distinct Camo categories: <strong>Military Camos</strong>, <strong>Special Camos</strong>, and <strong>Mastery Camos</strong>. Furthermore, the unlock conditions for a weapon’s Camo depend on the weapon itself, as well as which game mode you are playing.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 requires a certain amount of kills, Zombies asks for Critical Kills, and Warzone demands Eliminations.</p>



<h3 id="h-military-camos">Military Camos</h3>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name of Camo</th><th data-align="center">Camo Unlock Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Granite</td><td data-align="center">5 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Woodland</td><td data-align="center">10 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Savanna</td><td data-align="center">15 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Splinter</td><td data-align="center">20 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Moss</td><td data-align="center">30 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Shade</td><td data-align="center">40 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Digital</td><td data-align="center">50 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tide</td><td data-align="center">75 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Red Tiger</td><td data-align="center">100 Headshots</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-special-camos">Special Camos</h3>



<p>When all nine Military Camos have been earned for a weapon, it’s time to pursue the Special Camos. “<strong>Each Weapon has two unique Special Camo Swatches per mode that can only be earned with that weapon only</strong>,” explains Activision.</p>



<p>The publisher is keeping the nature of Special Camos a secret, and it’s a surprise to be discovered for the full launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-mastery-camos">Mastery Camos</h3>



<p>You can earn <strong>four Mastery Camos for each gameplay component</strong> of this year’s main Call of Duty package: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone—giving you <strong>12 Mastery Camos</strong> to earn in total.</p>



<p>Again, these are endgame skins likely to take many hours to unlock—so be patient, you can sport the skin once you’ve put the work in!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-mastery-camos-in-black-ops-6-zombies-and-warzone">How to unlock Mastery Camos in Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Mastery Camos need you to <strong>work your way through each tier of Mastery Camo until you unlock Black Ops 6’s best skins</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a simple set of instructions making the process easier to understand:</p>



<ol>
<li>First, earn all nine Military Camos for weapons in Black Ops 6, Zombies, or Warzone.</li>



<li>Next, unlock the two Special Camos.</li>



<li>Once you’ve done this, complete the Tier 1 Camo Challenge to earn either Gold, Mystic Gold, or Gold Tiger.</li>



<li>Earn Gold, Mystic Gold, or Gold Tiger on the launch guns in a weapon type.</li>



<li>Complete the Tier 2 Camo challenge to get Diamond, Opal, or King’s Ransom.</li>



<li>Earn Diamond, Opal, or King’s Ransom on the starting weapons of all types.</li>



<li>Complete the Tier 3 Camo challenge to unlock Dark Spine, Afterlife, or Catalyst.</li>



<li>Earn Dark Spine, Afterlife, or Catalyst on the launch weapons across the different types.</li>



<li>Complete the Tier 4 Camo challenge to unlock Dark Matter, Nebula, or Abyss.</li>
</ol>
