                <p>Black Myth: Wukong, one of 2024's best-selling games worldwide, is finally headed to Xbox after a year of exclusivity on PlayStation. The game is coming to Xbox Series X|S on August 20, with preorders opening on June 18.</p><p>The game originally released on PS5 and PC on August 20, 2024, meaning it's coming to Xbox Series X|S precisely one year later. This is fueling the theory that Sony did, in fact, have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-report/1100-6526196/" data-ref-id="1100-6526196">one-year exclusivity deal with developer Game Science.</a></p><p>Some had claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> prompted a delay for the Xbox version, but Microsoft maintained this was not true (despite the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819">some titles have in the past run into issues</a> with the lower-spec version of the newest Xbox).</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on the game's website</a>, Game Science said it took time to bring Black Myth to Xbox because it was "no easy feat" to ensure the experience met the developer's internal expectations. "Fortunately, we were able to complete this challenging task smoothly within the first year of the game's official release," the developer said.</p><p>What's more, Game Science has announced the first-ever discount on Black Myth, stating the game will be 20% off beginning June 18 on all platforms. That means Xbox players can preorder the game at a 20% discount, bringing the price down from $60 to about $48.</p><p>Black Myth sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">10 million copies in its first three days</a> and has gone on to shift <a href="https://s3.hatchbuck.com/WebTemplates/5009e2fc130048b2970ee352f5cf59c3.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 25 million units.</a> At launch, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">overwhelming majority of PC sales on Steam came from China</a>, where its developer is based.

Game Science's guidelines for content creators asked them to avoid discussing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guidelines-ask-content-creators-not-to-discuss-feminist-propaganda-covid-and-more/1100-6525951/" data-ref-id="1100-6525951">"feminist propaganda" and COVID.</a> A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from IGN in 2023</a> documented the alleged sexist and misogynist commentary from the development team.</p><p>If you're just getting started with Black Myth, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/black-myth-wukong-tips-beginners-guide/2900-5688/" data-ref-id="2900-5688">GameSpot's Black Myth: Wukong guide that runs through 20 things to know before you jump in.</a> We also have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guides-hub/1100-6525898/" data-ref-id="1100-6525898">dedicated guides hub</a> where you can get all the key info you need.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-preview-%E2%80%93-team-ninja%E2%80%99s-answer-to-elden-ring.1209213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nioh-3-preview-team-ninjas-answer-to-elden-ring/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For almost a decade Japanese developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> has been hot on the heels of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a>, the studio behind <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, and indeed the wider “Soulslike” genre. Many have tried to replicate and remix that formula to varying levels of success, Team Ninja being the most dogged and consistent in that pursuit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>2017’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> ticked all the boxes, including brutal skill-based combat, a dark oppressive world, and a satisfying risk/reward progression, while adding its own kinetic combat touches. After all, these are the guys who developed the 3D <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series. Since then, the studio has put its name to a successive string of Souslike games including <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a>, each wrapping that familiar action RPG core with new and interesting design ideas.</p>


<p>Announced during Sony’s recent State of Play broadcast, Nioh 3 doesn’t require you to have played the two previous games in the series, even if that might help. It may share the same setting and core gameplay design, but this isn’t a continuous story. As a lone warrior destined to become Shogun, you enter a world gripped by a bloody conflict as Japanese warlords vye for power amidst a demonic Yokai invasion.</p>
<p>The Nioh series has always excelled in blending elements of mythology and folklore with real-world history, giving the games a distinct identity that is equal parts grim and enchanting. Once idyllic landscapes are now wreathed in a pulsating aura of corruption as a menagerie of spirits, beasts, and other monstrosities predate upon the remaining pockets of humanity who have yet to succumb to war.</p>


<p>Nioh fans will immediately feel at home, though there are some new gameplay quirks that take some getting used to. Players will notice that the main character is more agile and dynamic in their movements – something carried forward from Wo Long and the more recent Rise of the Ronin. They can double jump and dodge in mid-air, adding a greater sense of verticality to Nioh’s combat and exploration.</p>
<p>Another major new gameplay feature allows the player to seamlessly switch between Samurai and Ninja playstyles, both with their own unique abilities, movesets, and equipment loadouts. Where the Samurai is more defence-focused with hard-hitting charged attacks the Ninja is capable of running rings around sluggish opponents, delivering a flurry of attacks before using their Mist evade to fall back. Naturally, players are likely to gravitate towards one of playstyle, though Team Ninja makes an argument for using both to suit different combat scenarios.</p>
<p>Nioh 3’s evolution doesn’t stop there. With FromSoftware having broken the bonds of its traditional “open linear” level design with Elden Ring’s open world, Nioh was bound to follow suit. Again, we got a taste of this in Rise of the Ronin, and at first it can be a little disorientating. Nioh 3’s opening stage serves as a tight-knit tutorial, allowing newcomers and veterans to cut their teeth on a few skirmishes before squaring up to a tough first boss – a member of Takeda Shingen’s Crimson Cavalry.</p>

<p>However, it isn’t long before players are unleashed upon a vast new landscape that stretches in just about every direction. Although there’s a gleaming icon on the HUD compass, players are invited to forge their own path, discovering hidden treasures, completing side quests, and stumbling upon horrific enemies they have no chance of defeating. The Shrines dotted throughout act as resting points where you can replenish items, trade goods, and funnel resources into boosting various stats and skills, enabling a multitude of build possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-revealed-for-ps5-with-a-demo-available-today/">Playing the Nioh 3 alpha demo</a> it’s clear to see how ambitious the scope of this game is, building on countless gameplay innovations and experiments Team Ninja has developed across its stable of recent action RPGs. It’s not just bigger, it’s deeper and more layered, instantly becoming one of our most anticipated PlayStation 5 games of 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arrowhead-tencent-stake-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-reportedly-bought-a-15-stake-in-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-last-year.1209210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arrowhead-tencent-stake-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Chinese gaming and tech giant Tencent purchased a 15% stake in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead Game Studios last year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-has-acquired-15-75-of-arrowhead-game-studios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a> (which in turn cites Swedish publications <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dagens Industri</a> and <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Breakit</a>), Tencent paid roughly $83 million for the stake, which represents a fraction of Arrowhead's reported valuation of about $532 million.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming also says that Arrowhead chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt welcomed the deal, claiming that it will open up the Chinese market for Arrowhead. Pilestedt also apparently said that the Chinese player base is the "holy grail" in the gaming industry (a quote for which Insider uses machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-tencent.jpg?itok=_hrMT8gp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-tencent.jpg?itok=39bIK_xt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead can reportedly now count Tencent among its shareholders.</figcaption></figure><p>Arrowhead is far from the only Western game company in which Tencent has a stake. The company is one of Ubisoft's major shareholders, having recently had a major role in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">creation of a new entity</a> that will handle much of Ubisoft's most popular IP.</p>

<p>Tencent also counts&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">Techland</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">FromSoftware</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>giant Epic Games among its investments, with the latter having landed Tencent in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-government-investigating-epic-games-riot-games-due-to-tencent" rel="nofollow">hot water with the US government</a> in the past.</p>

<p>That's not to mention Tencent's many collaborations with other studios in the gaming industry, like its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>mobile RPG</a> or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">mobile version of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy XIV</a>&nbsp;</em>(which has yet to come to the West). Suffice it to say Tencent is a pretty big deal, even for the Western gaming industry.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Arrowhead, meanwhile, its most recent (and by far its biggest) game is PS5 and PC exclusive&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">passed twelve million sales last year</a>&nbsp;and which has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">board game adaptation</a> on the way as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=igpWSSDF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=YUxI8iJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is a big deal for Arrowhead.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s monumental success, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking about what to do next; in January, he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">announced he would take a "sabbatical"</a> before returning to work on the studio's next project.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Tencent's investment in Arrowhead will result in any major creative changes for the company, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

According to data compiled by the website, State of Play now ranks as the third most-popular gaming or tech showcase of 2025 by peak concurrent viewership.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-best-selling-eshop-launch-games-revealed-and-those-10-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-upgrades-are-right-up-there<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">24 hours into the life of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, it's time to look at what's selling best on the new console's eShop — and get a sense of just how popular those rather minimal-looking Zelda upgrades have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Top of the Switch 2 eShop charts at the time of writing is, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — the console's flagship launch title that many (most?) owners will have picked up alongside the console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise to see this in the top spot, and anyone who bought the Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World included will have contributed to its placing here, as you'll have had to redeem an eShop code and download its digital version.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, perhaps surprisingly, is Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. Developer CD Projekt will no doubt be delighted to see its latest game doing so well on Switch 2, after it previously skipped Nintendo's last-gen console. With the power to run Cyberpunk's Night City now available, Switch 2 owners look to have jumped at the chance to catch up with the open-world RPG. Earlier this week, IGN chatted with CD Projekt to find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">how the developer managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 working on Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third is Nintendo's own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>. This is the $10 collection of mini-games and tech demos that many fans believe should have been offered for free (and after an hour with the game myself last night, I am inclined to agree). Part instruction manual, part interactive museum exhibit, Welcome Tour is at least fairly cheap. (Just remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-which-everyone-thinks-should-be-free-requires-95-of-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-for-100-completion">you'll need a camera and a separate controller/grip with GL/GR buttons to play everything included in it</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fourth best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, a game which you may not have heard of. This fast-paced sci-fi racer is an interesting addition to the console's launch line-up, as developer Shin'en Multimdia previously released the similar Fast RMX as a launch title for the original Switch, back in March 2017. Why is this series popular with Nintendo fans? Well, because it is essentially F-Zero. And without a new F-Zero from Nintendo anytime soon (if ever again), hardcore Nintendo fans love it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fast Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The fifth biggest game on the Switch 2 eShop is not actually a game, but an upgrade — yes, it's the $10 upgrade to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. It's interesting to see this chart so highly, as Nintendo Switch Online subscribers do get this add-on included as part of their membership. But perhaps fans have decided they want it to keep? Or maybe they haven't realised. Regardless, the fact this upgrade is so popular clearly shows Nintendo was right to assume people would pay up for some improved visuals (something you get free in upgrades to other titles, such as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet), plus access to a new mobile app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sixth on the Switch 2 eShop right now is Deltarune, which just launched its latest chapters this week. Seventh is the $10 upgrade pack for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> (as an older game, perhaps fewer people are still playing it compared to Tears of the Kingdom). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In eighth place is relaxing role-player Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, while ninth place goes to Square Enix's Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster. This is followed by Yakuza 0 and Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After these, the full Switch 2 Editions of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild sandwich Hitman World of Assassination. And lastly in the chart is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, whose Switch 2 version features a number of graphical upgrades. A $10 upgrade for this Harry Potter prequel RPG is also available if you owned the game on the original Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Finally, here is the Switch 2 eShop launch day chart as a handy list:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</li><li>Fast Fusion</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Upgrade Pack</li><li>Deltarune</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Upgrade Pack</li><li>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</li><li>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</li><li>Yakuza 0</li><li>Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</li><li>Hitman: World of Assassination</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

    <p><span>The paths and fates of the Traveler twins cross once more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [124 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “A Space and Time for You,” will launch on June 18, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [197 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-970467"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>One of the major highlights of the update will be the introduction of the new playable character, Skirk, a powerful and enigmatic figure with deep ties to the Abyss who fights in two distinct combat styles. As one powerful companion joins the fray, a new unrest brews between the Traveler twins, with looming darkness drawing ever closer in the new Archon Quest. A new power is rising, and so too does the story of the Travelers march toward a pivotal new phase.</p><p>Version 5.7 will mark the long-awaited debut of Skirk as a playable character. She is known as Childe’s enigmatic master, and once trained under Surtalogi “The Foul,” one of Khaenri’ah’s Five Sinners. Wielding Abyssal power camouflaged as Cryo, this 5-star character shifts between two combat styles: One that relies on enhanced Normal Attacks for sustained damage, or another that uses her Elemental Burst to deal powerful AoE Cryo damage. Both modes draw on Serpent’s Subtlety, a unique resource generated from Skirk’s Skills and Talents, instead of Elemental Energy. Skirk also brings valuable synergy to teams with only Hydro and Cryo characters (with at least one of each in the party), granting an extra level to their Elemental Skills and a significant DMG buff to herself.</p><p>Also joining the roster is Dahlia, a new 4-star Hydro support character and the Deacon of the Church of Favonius. Dahlia offers versatile support in the form of a renewable shield created by his Elemental Burst, which can be reactivated by Normal Attacks or Freeze reactions. He can also boost teammates’ ATK SPD with his Talent, and use his Elemental Skill to bounce allies high into the air or deal Hydro DMG to enemies. For the Event Wishes of Version 5.7, the first half will feature Skirk, Dahlia, and Shenhe’s rerun, followed by reruns of the Pyro Archon Mavuika and Emilie in the second half.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_970468"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Following the “Bedtime Story” quest, the Archon <a title="Platforms > Quest [142 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a> continues to unravel the tale of the Traveler and their sibling. In this new chapter, the Abyss Order begins to mobilize in Natlan as part of their sibling’s grand plan. Natlan’s defenders, including Mavuika and her allies, remain on high alert, while Dainsleif joins Traveler on the front lines in a form that players have never seen before. As the journey leads them deeper into the domain of the Abyss Order, the Traveler may begin to uncover some long-buried truths about their sibling’s schemes.</p><p>In Version 5.7, the Sumeru <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>demiya will launch a new simulated <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,313 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> that combines tactical team-building with a touch of luck. Travelers can select Companion Pieces to form their lineup, power their pieces up, and choose between rainforest or desert routes with unique challenges, narratives, and unexpected encounters. To prepare for the journey, Travelers may also take part in research stages, guiding Paimon to harvest fruit to gain extra buffs. Completing the event gives rewards such as Primogems, as well as the opportunity to invite Sethos to their party.</p><p>A new permanent combat mode, “Stygian Onslaught,” will also be available. With 3 bosses that rotate every update and 6 escalating levels of difficulty, players can complete the trials to claim Artifacts and even a new item called “Dust of Enlightenment,” which allows for the re-rolling of the minor affixes’ enhancements on a Level 20 Artifact.</p><p>Meanwhile, “Travelers’ Tales: Gilded Chapter” will bring lighthearted stories from all over Teyvat. Thoma returns to Mondstadt, Neuvillette visits Merusea Village, and Dori tries to strike a deal with Sayu in Inazuma. These stories are sure to offer moments of reprieve between adventures.</p><p>In addition, more optimizations will be implemented in Version 5.7. More game resource options will be available for <em>Genshin Impact</em> on mobile based on players’ progress and preferences. Additionally, players will now be able to directly use Fragile Resin to claim tripled rewards from Ley Line Blossoms and common challenge Domains, such as Artifact and Talent Material Domains. New Envisaged Echoes challenges for Raiden Shogun and Shenhe will also be added in Version 5.7.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,623 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,304 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,057 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

		<p>Black Myth: Wukong is going to be released on August 20th for Xbox Series X|S, exactly a year after the game was made available on PS5 and PC. Pre-orders for the Xbox version will go live on June 18th, alongside a 20% discount for the PS5 and PC versions of Black Myth: Wukong. Xbox pre-orders will be discounted too, so it matches the promotional discount on PS5 and PC.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by the 16th century Chinese novel “Journey to The West” by Wu Cheng’en. This has been adapted and twisted into a Souls-like, as we’ve seen in recent times with other myths, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>&nbsp;and the Pinocchio story.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Black Myth: Wukong review, Jason said, <em>“Black Myth: Wukong is a stunning game to look at, but the exploration is lacking, and the fighting is just sort of fine for the most part. It’s just a bit uninspiring, and isn’t a game that I’m expecting to stick with me for any length of time now that I’m done with it.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-version<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Exactly one year after its release on PS5 and PC, celebrated Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1930806857725026414" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms the news</a> in a post on X, simultaneously revealing a release date of August 20th, which is, to the day, exactly a year after it was released on Sony's platform and on PC.</p>

<p>This release date arguably throws some doubt on the idea that the Xbox Series S console's memory limitations were to blame for the port's delay, which was the official line taken by developer Game Science <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">back in January this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-release-date-potion.jpg?itok=1BFhyhK4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-release-date-potion.jpg?itok=K90vimi5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S.</figcaption></figure><p>Certainly, some <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1930854070551523584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">people</a> in the replies for Xbox's message are <a href="https://x.com/SnapBlastPLAY/status/1930905753251922425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that the previously-mooted Sony exclusivity deal may be the <a href="https://x.com/Charmer184/status/1930834254499590506" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reason</a> for the August 20th release date, or at the very least that the Xbox Series S' memory limitations weren't really to blame.</p>

<p>In fairness to Microsoft and Game Science, the Xbox Series S is a notably less powerful machine than the Series X, and&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a notoriously demanding game, requiring some pretty hefty hardware to run well on PC.</p>

<p>In any case, if you're an Xbox Series owner, you'll finally get to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on your console on August 20th. The timing of this announcement is also notable, coming as it does just two days before Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-summer-show-date-2025-the-outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow">Summer Game Fest showcase</a>.</p>

<p>While we don't know what surprises Xbox has in store for that show, we can reasonably guess that a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be revealed, given that a showcase specifically dedicated to the game will air after Xbox's main show.</p>

            <p>In case you hadn't herd, a little something called the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> released yesterday. Nintendo's latest console arrived in a flurry of red boxes, with many new owners quickly making the most of launch title <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there is one standout star in Mario Kart World. No, not Mario, Luigi, Peach or any other of Nintendo's staple karting racers. Rather, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">the all-new Cow has stolen the hearts of many a Mario Kart World owner</a>, to the point where races are now a mélange of moooo-ving parts.</p>

<p>There have been numerous social media posts showing Mario Kart World races which have been infected with rad cow disease (thank Ian for that pun).</p>
<p>"24 people all cows," reads one translated Mario Kart World post on X, with an accompanying video proving these players aren't doing things by calf measure. "Mario Kart is too chaotic, lol."</p> <div>

<p>"Anyone else's online lobbies look like this in Mario Kart World?" another poster asked with yet another stacked image of bovines getting ready to battle it out (cattle it out?) for that sweet gold cup.</p>
<p>"I've been in three full cow races."</p> <div>

<p>Cow certainly seems popular, with other users just sharing posts of appreciation for the new racer. </p>
<p>"COW MAINS RISE UP MOOO," reads one social media post, complete with their Cow reaching up in victory, udders flying in the breeze like they just don't have a care in the world.</p> <div>

<p>So, have you managed to get your hands (or hooves) on Mario Kart World yet? Who is your go-to racer? My console still hasn't arrived yet, but when it does, perhaps I will see you in one of those lobbies bursting at the seams with Cow!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are yet to play but are planning on it later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-mario-kart-world-defaults-to-smart-steering-but-its-easily-turned-off">know that Smart Steering controls are on by default</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> has arrived on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> as part of its GameCube collection, but the default controls make the game virtually unplayable.</p>
<p>This might shock you for a racing game, but F-Zero GX is all about going really fast. And to do that you need to boost - a lot.</p>
<p>Except by default, the Switch 2 maps accelerate to the A button and boost to the Y button. In order to effectively boost you need to be accelerating, which means hitting both buttons at the same time. And that's practically impossible, especially without hitting the B button which is brake by default.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it's easy enough to remap the controls. Hit the minus button to suspend the game and bring up the options, and from here you can switch any of the controls around.</p>
<p>So what's best? I swapped the Y and B buttons around, so I could boost more easily instead of braking. After all, who hits the brakes in an F-Zero game?</p>
<p>An alternative would be to put boost on X, which is also accessible while pressing A to accelerate, though you'll need to move attacks (on X) to another button. This A and X combo would mimic the original controls that put boost on the kidney shaped Y button above the central A.</p>
<p>Another option would be to put boost on the Switch 2's L button, which is unused by default.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Of course, the real alternative Nintendo wants is for you to buy the GameCube controller, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">that'll set you back almost 60 quid</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">remaining two GameCube classics are The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur 2</a>, but the controls appear much more manageable by default. The collection is available for those with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>F-Zero GX was developed by Sega and published by Nintendo for the GameCube back in 2003. Since then, we haven't had a new home console entry in the series (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-feels-like-a-battle-royale-in-a-pinball-machine">beyond F-Zero 99</a>). Still, I'm very happy to see Switch 2 technically launch with an F-Zero game, just like the SNES and GBA did - I've missed those camp post-race news reports.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may not be among the best-looking open-world games released in the past few years, but it can look stunning with some choice mods on PC, which outshine the recently released Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>
<p>A new video shared a few days ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shows the latest main entry in the series running on PC via an emulator at 8K resolution with some mods, such as the Ultra CAM mod by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MaxLastBreath">MaxLastBreath</a> and ReShade ray tracing. As even an RTX 5090 has some trouble running the game at 60 FPS at such a high resolution and with these mods, it would have been unreasonable to expect such a makeover to run on the Nintendo Switch 2, so those who wish to experience the game like never before have no choice but to turn to emulation.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Zelda Tears of the Kingdom - Ultra CAM extreme Settings RAYTRACING RTX5090 gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Mcf-9g5CQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't feature any transformative visual improvements doesn't mean that the new version of the game doesn't feature enhancements that enhance the experience. Besides offering 60 FPS gameplay at 1080p resolution, the Switch 2 version of the game also features faster load times, which makes fast traveling much more convenient, and support for the Zelda Notes app, which provides a navigation feature, milestone tracking, and more.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom builds on the features introduced by its predecessor to offer a compelling experience no matter the system used to play. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>

For everyone else, the game goes live on June 10, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concurrent players isn't the only metric we should use when measuring how successful a game is, of course, but it's a good starting point, even though it doesn't account for players on other platforms (not that Dune: Awakening is available on other platforms just yet; the PS5 and Xbox Series release will follow at a later date).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Historically, weekends are usually when most players opt to jump into a game, so it's possible Dune: Awakening will hit an even higher peak concurrent count before official launch on June 10. Of the thousands of games currently on sale on Steam, it's currently 195th in the chart of the highest-ever concurrent peaks. Not bad for a game that's not even out yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven't yet had chance to review Dune: Awakening, but we did have take an extended peek when the beta was live. "As a longtime fan of Dune, it also just feels so good to explore and learn more about a world that I’m quite fond of, and Funcom has clearly put a ton of effort into worldbuilding and lore, even despite taking quite a bit of creative liberty by placing Awakening within a parallel reality and canon than the books/movies," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakenings-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions"><u>IGN's Dune: Awakening closed beta impressions preview</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are little details that have a massive impact on gameplay. I won’t go into spoilers, but this kind of attention to detail touches just about every aspect of the world, including the factions and characters you meet along the way, which should be a treat for any fan of the setting."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out details on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-says-its-release-date-is-the-full-launch-and-while-theres-no-subscription-there-will-be-optional-dlcs"><u>the MMO's business model and post-launch plans</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/fast-fusion-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Fast Fusion was my first Switch 2 game. While I had Mario Kart World waiting in the wings, it was this indie racer, available at launch for a bargain price, that was my first choice for the brand new Nintendo system. You might be wondering if I’ve lost all my marbles, but if you’re a Nintendo fan, you’ll know that this is a racing series that’s consistently delivered an experience far beyond its indie trappings. We’re not getting a new F-Zero or Wipeout, but with Fast Fusion, you likely won’t care.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fast Fusion – Ultra fast, ultra essential anti-grav racing for Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2r6iGXoa0YU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Anti-grav racing is hardly new – Wipeout first appeared on the PlayStation in 1995, and F-Zero on the SNES in 1990 – but time, or licenses, seem to have dwindled in recent years for a futuristic sub-genre that used to sit on the cutting edge of tech. The Fast series began life on the Wii with Fast Racing League, appearing on the Wii U with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/16/fast-racing-neo-review/">Fast Racing Neo</a> and then an enhanced version on the original Switch with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/09/fast-rmx-review/">Fast RMX</a>. Each time, developers Shin’en Multimedia found a way to make the hardware sing, producing games that looked like AAA racers on indie budgets, and keeping a genre alive to boot.</p>


<p>Fast Fusion looks like a true current gen racing title, fit for your PS5 or Xbox Series X. The different tracks in particular look stunning, with the sweeping views as you load into a race showcasing the detail and depth of each intergalactic locale. While each track is tied together by industrial sections of gleaming metal, the different landscapes shift between the traditional vision of the future with its towering structures of metal and glass and more naturalistic luscious forests, each track also bringing different hazards to bear on the racers as well. The incremental details are just amazing, from Sand Whales leaping out of the desert, to the Ewok-esque tree hazards in the forest</p>
<p>Fast Fusion, as with its predecessors, is a true racing game. There is combat, but it’s not in the vein of Wipeout or Mario Kart where you’re given weaponry to help move up the leaderboard. Fast Fusion is about going, well… fast, and while your vessel is pretty nippy to begin with, even on the introductory Subsonic circuits, you need to utilise boosting to succeed.</p>


<p>There’s two types of boost. Firstly, you collect charges as you race, which alongside serving as currency, also give you a shot of nitro for each one you collect. You don’t hold this boost down, instead firing singular shots of it off, allowing you to be more directed with it. These boosts also allow you to attack your competitors, and hitting a player while you’re boosting will see them spin out, slowing them down and putting you ahead.</p>
<p>You gain the other type of boost via the coloured speed pads found on the floor of each circuit. Coming in blue or red, you have to select your vehicle’s frequency to match that – shown in the exhaust fumes coming from your ship – and if they match you’ll speed up significantly.</p>
<p>Get it wrong, and the pad will actually slow you down, electricity arcing from the ship to the pad as it struggles for anti-grav traction. It’s such a simple mechanic, but an incredibly clever one. Many circuits will also stagger differently coloured pads back-to-back, and it throws in rhythm action test of your reactions beyond the actual racing.</p>
<p>You start off with access to three ships, with fourteen standard craft available in total. What’s interesting here, and what gives the game the ‘Fusion’ in the name, is that you can mash two of them together, creating a new craft that draws in elements from each of the original ones. After completing the first cup, I merged the primary ship with one I bought, upping both the top speed and the boost capacity, while adding to the weight, giving it a whole new look along the way.</p>

<p>Despite weighing more, this new ship was a clear improvement, and the whole idea just feels great, like you’re taking part in futuristic racing R&amp;D. It also gives you a ton of options to explore in terms of visuals and stats, giving you an added reason to unlock all of the ships as you clear the different Leagues.</p>
<p>The vehicles here clearly owe a debt to Wipeout’s art direction, but it’s pretty hard to truly innovate in the space when the Psygnosis team perfected the concept on the first attempt, and then upped the fidelity each time It’s simply a stunning looking game though. Fast Fusion looks like a current-gen title, and it’s got to be amongst the best-looking indie racers of all time.</p>
<p>Quite how the team continue to pull off this feat, I’ll never know, but they do, and here it’s delivered in 60FPS with HDR. Interestingly, there’s a host of graphics settings to choose from too, and you can go all the way up to 4K at 30fps if you want Ultra Quality, but there’s presets that target 60fps with varying shadowing and details for 4K, 1440p and 1080p. Frankly, it looks amazing in the 1080p Performance mode, and I was hard pressed to see too many differences in the more graphically intensive settings above it. As long as it’s 60fps, they all feel great.</p>

<p>Those spectacular visuals are combined with genre-required hard-hitting electro and dance, but rather than just relying on the familiar, there’s a suite of interesting instrumentation from around the world, as well as more dramatic, symphonic pieces that wouldn’t sound out of place in a sci-fi movie. The different tracks fit perfectly with the different tracks and areas they represent, and they’re undeniably part of the game’s character and appeal.</p>
<p>Fast Fusion offers plenty of longevity, with the Championship racing your initial gateway into the game. Each League contains multiple races, unlocked via the same currency you use to buy and fuse your ships – it’s worth remembering this at the start, as I spent all my money on ships before realising I needed money to advance to the next League – and there’s a svelte selection of twelve tracks in total to race on. More tracks would be lovely, but it’s worth remembering the £13.50 price point.</p>
<p>There’s then Super Hero Mode, which tasks you with completing a race in first place, without crashing, while jumping decreases boost energy, and that boost energy is also your shield energy. When it calls it Super Hero Mode, it flipping means it, and this is a cruel and punishing reworking of the game’s rules to push you to the limit. It gives you some lovely prize money for succeeding though, so you can buy a new ship after you’ve got over the whole thing.</p>
<p>Time Trial does exactly what you’d expect it to, though it gives you the Shin’en team’s best lap time to beat for each track, once more giving you some cash for achieving it, as well as giving you the bragging rights for beating the people that made the game.</p>

<p>Multiplayer is perhaps the biggest sign that this is a budget release, as there’s a limited online racing component. You can race in splitscreen with up to three friends, or there’s GameShare functionality which lets you beam the game to another Nintendo Switch 2, either locally or via the Switch 2’s new GameChat function. With GameShare everyone gets to race on their own Switch 2, with the host Switch 2 rendering and streaming a game view of the race for each individual player, but you’re playing with only one copy of the game. It’s great that you can experience racing against your friends, but I’ll be hoping that Fast Fusion sells well enough that Shin’en decide to add a true online component in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-revealed-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona 4 Remake</a> is going to be revealed during this year's Xbox Games Showcase in two days, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/persona-4-remake-xbox-games-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP1st</a>, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to the outlet that the remake of the fourth entry in the series by ATLUS will be revealed on June 8th during the annual Xbox Games Showcase. The source confirmed the game is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, but couldn't confirm a Nintendo Switch 2 version, so there's the chance the game will launch later on Nintendo's new system. No other details have been confirmed, so it remains to be seen if the Persona 4 Remake will feature improvements in line with those seen in<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/"> Persona 3 Reload</a>, and if it will be based on the original, or the Golden enhanced version.</p>
<p>What we know almost for sure about the remake is that none of the original voice cast will be returning. In the past few weeks, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">Yuri Lowenthal</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-wont-see-the-return-of-another-beloved-voice-actress/">Erin Fitzgerald</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/">Amanda Winn Lee</a>, who voiced Yosuke, Chie, and Yukiko, won't return in the remake. Having contributed so much to the characters they played, it is disappointing not to see them return, but at the same time, it's not exactly surprising they won't, considering Persona 3 Reload features a brand new voice cast.</p>
<p>The Persona 4 Remake has yet to be officially announced. We will cover this Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase as it happens, so stay tuned for the official announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Studio Wildcard is celebrating the 10-year anniversary since the early access launch of ARK: Survival Evolved in its Unreal Engine 5 remaster, ARK: Survival Ascended, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-first-ue5-gameplay-cross-platform-modding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>During this event, Survivors can collect cake slices for buffs, discover a flashy set of Party Dinos, and grab new cosmetics like the Birthday Suit and Party Hat skins. There's even a DJ Party emote, a Rave Dance, and a Club ARK tropical Island makeover. The 10-year anniversary celebration is already live on official servers until Tuesday, June 17. Owners of unofficial ARK servers can enable it by adding "-ActiveEvent=Birthday" to their command line. The developers also introduced a drop-down option to enable Active Events in Host/Single-Player mode under Game Rules &gt; Rules.</p>
<p>There's a lot more in store for fans than just the event, though. A free update has been released, updating the game from Unreal Engine 5.2 to Unreal Engine 5.5. According to Studio Wildcard, players can expect a noticeable performance boost, not to mention improved visual rendering, quicker loading times, and a lower install size thanks to optional downloads for the expansion DLCs. Additionally, PlayStation 5 Pro owners can look forward to improved long-range shadow and support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscale, which delivers up to 30% higher frame rates.</p>

<p>There's also new content available for owners of the Astraeos DLC. The Lemnokis update adds another vast island created by the renowned ARK modder Nekatus. This sprawling new island features diverse biomes, hidden caves, and towering redwoods. Its ancient ruins and colossal statues hint at lost civilizations. However, the lush expansion isn't just for sightseeing, as players can also take on the game's first-ever duo minibosses: Kalydonios and Erymanthian. These two massive boars fight with fire and poison. From deep-sea resource zones and the mysterious Maelstrom far offshore to a glacier cave tucked beneath the redwoods, Lemnokis is loaded with far-flung new adventures and prime build spots, not to mention the return of the fan-favourite snow owls.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> kicked off its early release for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition players yesterday, hitting a peak player count of almost 100k worm lovers.</p>
<p>This early launch, which requires people to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99 to hop in, immediately found itself a sandy society of 79,410. The following hours would see the figure slowly climb to a peak of 93,634 before tapering off for the night.</p>
<p>Prior to the release the game surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">Steam Top Sellers page</a>, falling short of just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>. Earlier this year the game held its final invite-only beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">which eventually opened to those who pre-ordered</a>. That beta hit a peak of 37,889, so there's a real sign of growth in terms of early adopters.</p>

<p>The launch was not without its technical stumbles, the eternal curse of MMO launches. A selection of players suffered from crashes and freezing issues, with Funcom urging those affected to update Nvidia drivers, limit in-game CPU usage, and disable Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling.</p>
<p>Server capacity issues were also a thorn in the player's side initially. Due to the number of players flooding in, Sietches (the game's name for server instances) were filling up fast. In response, Funcom pumped up the number of players that could populate each Sietche so playing with friends was more feasible.</p>
<p>But compared to the launches of the past, it's not too drastic a technical disaster! Which is good for these kinds of games, first impressions are crucial and nothing turns people away like a massive login queue or progress blockers. </p>
<p>As for what this means for Dune Awakening? Well, the fact that this pre-order release has hit a far larger peak than the previous beta indicates a real growth in interest for the game, and that a substantial number of players dropped a solid chunk of cash on the game to get in ASAP.</p>
<p>In addition, it may just be a canary in the coal mine for an even greater spike in popularity come June 10, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">when those who nab the standard version of Dune Awakening gain access</a>. Given you've got streamers diving in, plenty of buzz on social media, and a strong start reverberating around the MMO space right now, I'd imagine the Funcom devs are absolutely beaming right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Switch 2 launch day was filled with disappointment for some unlucky GameStop patrons, with reports emerging online of receipts being stapled to the front of Switch 2 boxes going deep enough through the cardboard to damage the screen of the Switch 2 console beneath.</p>
<p>Thankfully, GameStop has quickly followed up on this, figuring out that it was “isolated to one store” and offering replacement consoles to those affected. They’ve also claimed to have confiscated the staplers in question to prevent this happening again!</p>



<p>The GameStop store was one of those in Staten Island, New York that was open for a midnight launch of the Switch 2, with those queueing up to grab a Switch 2 at the earliest possible moment having a real sour note upon opening the box. Someone had the bright idea of stapling the receipts to the front of the Switch 2 box, presumably unaware that the Switch 2 and Joy-Con are placed right beneath this surface. Unfortunately, the staples went deep enough to scratch or puncture the screens, creating two dots of dead pixels.</p>


<p>Obviously the only move from GameStop was to hold up their hands to the error and replace the consoles, and thankfully they seem to have stock available in order to do this.</p>

            <p>The team over at CD Projekt may be busy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">working on a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but that doesn't mean it has finished with the first game. Last night, the developer announced that, yes, there is another update on the way for V and the rest of Night City.</p>
<p>The news was shared during a dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/t_SENc98vkI?t=3621s">Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 livestream</a>. Just around the time the developer was wrapping up its stream, the host drew attention to some of the questions viewers had been asking. Well, she drew attention to one particular question viewers had been asking: Is there going to be more DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>?</p>
<p>"I can tell you right now, we are planning another part for the game," senior community manager Alicja Kozera casually dropped. "The last one wasn't the last one."</p>

<p>This update will be known as 2.3, and will arrive later this month, on 26th June. Further details on what exactly will be included with this particular Cyberpunk 2077 update will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Sharing the news <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">again on social media</a>, CD Projekt's global community director Marcin Momot proclaimed: "We're not done yet!"</p>
<p>Momot again reiterated that the team would be "spilling the beans" closer to that 26th June release date, asking that fans wait patiently for more news and "let the team cook".</p>

<p>Rumours that Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this week, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077, it is now available on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the Switch 2 already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Much love chooms 🥰”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt didn’t say what is in patch 2.3, but given how meaningful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-22-fully-revealed-and-its-out-now">December 2024's patch 2.2 was</a>, fans are already getting excited. Let’s remember that last patch, created in partnership with support developer Virtuos, added in lots more customization options and made Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves, appear next to you more frequently. There were new secrets to discover, too. Could patch 2.3 go one step further and add new quests and characters? More information will be revealed later this month, CD Projekt said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement comes alongside the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and with the recent confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cyberpunk-2-enters-pre-production-and-yes-cd-projekt-is-officially-calling-it-cyberpunk-2-now">Cyberpunk 2 has moved into the pre-production phase of development</a>. But don’t hold your breath — CD Projekt has suggested it won't release until late 2030 or even early 2031.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, it seems the five-year-old Cyberpunk 2077 still has a lot to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
