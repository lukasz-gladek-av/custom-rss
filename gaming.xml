            <p>I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.</p>
<p>If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.</p><!--more-->
<p>Properly panoramic vistas aside, Veilguard will offer HDR and uncapped framerates together with an FOV slider. It supports a bunch of different ray tracing features, too, all the way from ray-traced reflections up to "Ultra RT" mode for "extremely high end rigs". I'm guessing none of these will work on my own PC, which seems to despise Ray and all his works. </p>
<p>There'll be upscaling options in the shape of NVIDIA DLSS 3, FSR 2.2 - "which has been heavily modified, specifically for the game" - and XeSS. Veilguard also supports DLSS 3 with frame generation and NVIDIA Reflex. All that's in addition to some more familiar graphics settings that let you mishandle and warp the simulation like one of the game's own escaped Elven deities. You can turn up and down the texture quality, mess with the shadows, apply camera effects such as motion blur, and turn up and down the hairiness of hair. Find out more in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/pc-features?isLocalized=true">the full blog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-the-release-date-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-leaks-a-few-hours-early">Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on 31st October</a>. There was a time when I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-makes-it-look-like-a-fornite-heist-movie">quite worried about it</a>. There are still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">a few things I'm iffy on</a>. But I'm looking forward to it now, if only because I like the Dragon Age world. So is former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah, who has returned to work as a consultant on Veilguard. He <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-mark-darrah-thinks-veilguard-is-the-first-dragon-age-where-the-combats-actually-fun">thinks Veilguard is the first Dragon Age where "the combat's actually fun"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The area is based on the prison used to hold various supervillains in Marvel comics. When you arrive here, you’ll notice that the prison is in chaos, with multiple areas being broken.<br></p><p>You’ll also see that there are some red lasers in the area. Avoid touching these, as doing so will set off an alarm and trigger everyone to fight you. If you’re looking to fight Emma Frost, she can be found sitting on a chair in the main prison area.</p><p>When you get close enough to her, the fight will begin, and she’ll transform into her diamond form, which will buff her temporarily. Once her diamond form drops, she’ll lose her buff. Besides her diamond form, she doesn’t do anything else, so this fight is more straightforward than the others.</p><p>After she dies, Emma Frost will drop the following items:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Emma Frost’s Reveal Medallion</li><li>Emma Frost’s Striker Burst Assault Rifle</li><li>Flowberry Fizz</li></ul><h2 id="h17807"><a id=""></a><strong>Doomstadt</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9bf8dc4ca1cc3b5780b43ab963f94bb9" data-recommend-id="image://9bf8dc4ca1cc3b5780b43ab963f94bb9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the Fallout/Marvel crossover we've all been dreaming of." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's the Fallout/Marvel crossover we've all been dreaming of." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9bf8dc4ca1cc3b5780b43ab963f94bb9" data-recommend-id="image://9bf8dc4ca1cc3b5780b43ab963f94bb9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the Fallout/Marvel crossover we've all been dreaming of." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Doomstadt is on the island’s northern end and east of Rebel’s Roost. The area is based on Latveria, the nation Doctor Doom leads. Think of this area essentially as a small Doctor Doom town. This is also where you can find Mysterio.<br></p><p>You can start the fight with Mysterio by either walking next to him or simply shooting him. Once the fight starts, he’ll teleport nearby, so be ready to move at a moment’s notice. For the first phase of the battle, he’ll shoot you with his shotgun, so make sure to keep a reasonable distance away from him.</p><p>When his shields are gone, he’ll clone himself. But you’ll be able to spot which one is the real one by aiming down sights. When you do, his health bar should appear—the real deal has multiple bars, but the clones will have just one line.</p><p>When you kill him, he’ll drop the following items:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mysterio’s Stealth Medallion</li><li>Mysterio’s Sovereign Shotgun</li><li>Flowberry Fizz</li></ul><h2 id="h17808"><a id=""></a><strong>Doom’s Courtyard</strong></h2><p>Doom’s Courtyard is on the northeast side of the island. Like Doomstadt, it’s another area based on Latveria. This area doesn’t have anything too significant to it, but there are a few chest and vending machines that you can use here.</p><h2 id="h17809"><a id=""></a><strong>Castle Doom</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0fec1ebd132dcf1539a36492b1b6b632" data-recommend-id="image://0fec1ebd132dcf1539a36492b1b6b632" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doombot is not pleased to see you in his castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doombot is not pleased to see you in his castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fec1ebd132dcf1539a36492b1b6b632" data-recommend-id="image://0fec1ebd132dcf1539a36492b1b6b632" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doombot is not pleased to see you in his castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Castle Doom is on the northeastern side of the island. As the name suggests, this is where Doom lives. This area is dedicated to Doom, as you can tell by all of the statues and artwork of the vainglorious villain. There’s a lot to explore in the area and even a handful of easter eggs for players to spot. This is also where you can fight the Doombot boss.<br></p><p>You’ll need to go to the throne room and approach him. Eventually he’ll get mad, and the fight will begin. His move set will consist of him throwing projectiles at you with his glove and shooting you with the Monarch Pistol. To make matters worse, he’ll summon a few guards to help him.</p><p>Once he’s dead, he’ll drop the following items:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Doombot’s Siphon Medallion</li><li>Flowberry Fizz</li><li>Doctor Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Doctor Dooms Monarch Pistol</li></ul><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release on PS5 sometime in <strong>Spring, 2025</strong>. Perhaps a firmer release date will be revealed as we near the game's Xbox release in December, but for now, this at least gives an idea of when PlayStation fans can expect to see Indy on their own console.</p><h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Trailer</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>What is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</h2><p>Set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle follows the titular archaeologist as he seeks to stop sinister forces who are, per <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox's website</a>, "scouring the globe for the secret to an ancient power connected to the Great Circle."

			<p>Crimson Desert is the latest project developed by Pearl Abyss, the developers behind the long-standing MMORPG Black Desert Online. Today at Gamescom 2024, attendees got to try Crimson Desert in a hands-on demo, revealing three bosses that players will encounter.</p>
<p>Originally, Crimson Desert was planned as a prequel to Black Desert Online but has since evolved into its own game while sharing thematic similarities to the popular MMORPG. It was also showcased at Gamescom 2023, with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">unspecified release date</a>.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was first announced in 2019 and has since been in development. There is very minimal information about It, but a trailer released in 2023 showcases more of the action-adventure side of the game.</p>
<p>The hands-on demo at Gamescom 2024 revealed four new bosses that attendees would get to experience exclusively. Pearl Abyss revealed the boss fights on YouTube that players would get to play in the demo. Players got to see the following boss fights at Gamescom:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2OCmtmwpVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Horn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz2m_k6L1q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reed Devil</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2fccBA64Ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staglord</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIsYk5MtjmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Queen Stoneback Crab</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Crimson Desert features stunning graphics developed using Pearl Abyss's proprietary engine, BlackSpace Engine. This engine is different from the one used for Black Desert Online, which also has its engine made explicitly for the MMORPG.</p>
<p>Over the years, Crimson Desert has received a multitude of trailers, including its first official reveal trailer, which was showcased in 2019. The game also received a five-minute gameplay trailer at The Game Awards in 2020, as well as two dev diaries, which were released in 2020.</p>
<p>The next piece of content the audience saw was the game trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2023, which showcased just over three minutes of gameplay. Since then, there has been relatively minimal news about the game's development, aside from the four boss fights that attendees and viewers on YouTube have now been introduced to.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert is said to be released on PC and Console, but it does not yet have a Steam page or anything similar. The <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main/Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> dedicated to Crimson Desert doesn't offer much, other than some high-fidelity screenshots that give minimal glimpses into what people can expect from the upcoming open-world action-adventure game.</p>
<p>So far, the game is stunning, with some incredibly intense combat against bosses. We can only hope that whatever comes out of Crimson Desert is just as good as what attendees have to experience at Gamescom 2024.</p>

If you haven’t been paying attention to the genre in recent years you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how diverse rhythm games can be. Within Rhythm Fest you’ll find incredible action games, first-person shooters, emotional visual novels, and more. It’s also a great excuse to pick up 2023’s surprise stunner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span>!</p><p>To help you make sense of all the games you can get on discount, here are seven titles we think you shouldn’t miss.</p><hr></div></div><div><p>Before making this year’s mind-bending mystery game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a></span>, developer Simogo made a big splash in 2019 with its vaporwave rhythm adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1122720/Sayonara_Wild_Hearts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1122720/Sayonara_Wild_Hearts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a></span>. Billed as a pop album video game, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> feels unlike anything else, and is more akin to a dream or a particularly trippy listening session. </p><p>Each level is set to a different song, which make up the game/album’s track list. Most of these levels take the form of an endless runner in which you move to avoid obstacles and collect hearts. There are boss fights peppered in as well, and everything incorporates rhythm inputs to the beat. It’s all a fast-paced fever dream that you only really begin to appreciate when you fully immerse yourself in the visual and sonic overload going on. To make the package sweeter, the game can be completed in about an hour, just about the runtime of a solid album with a hefty helping of bangers.</p></div><div><p>The coming-of-age story about anthropomorphic dinosaurs in high school waiting for the world to end might sound pretty out there, but the emotional beats of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1310330/Goodbye_Volcano_High/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1310330/Goodbye_Volcano_High/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Goodbye Volcano High</em></a></span> are deeply grounded in reality. One part visual novel and one part rhythm game, this title uses its musical themes to dive into the seemingly endless angst of its cast. They are all young kids lost in some way or another. For protagonist Fang, their band’s music becomes the central output for those messy feelings.</p><p><em>Goodbye Volcano High</em> pulls off something a lot of games about bands can’t: the music actually rocks. So when you get to take control and play through some challenging but rewarding rhythm sections in some sick tunes it only makes you feel better, even if the songs themselves are about some pretty heavy topics. The music is used to punctuate a larger story that pretty much everyone will connect with, one that is written with incredible care and earnestness. </p></div><div><p>Listen, you’ve probably heard about how good <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span> is so much by now that you are sick of it, but guess what? <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is really that good. The action-rhythm game from Tango Gameworks surprised everyone when it shadow-dropped in 2023 and turned out to be such a delight. </p><p>While that was partially due to its gorgeous, vibrant world and humorous tone brought to life by a wonderful cast of characters, the main attraction was the action. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is a hack-n-slash action game where launching attacks on the beat of the soundtrack gives you greater power. To help you stay on the rhythm, the whole world pulses to the tune of whatever song is playing. Getting into the groove and launching combos to the beat becomes a satisfying gameplay loop for action newbies and veterans alike.</p></div><div><p>This pick is all about silliness. You might have seen clips of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059990/Trombone_Champ/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059990/Trombone_Champ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Trombone Champ</em></a></span> cracking people up across the internet when it was released in 2022. That’s because the simple premise of a rhythm game in which you play trombone is really just a vessel for hilarious footage of people playing lots of famous songs very very badly. </p><p>The mii-like player avatars, constant hot-dog jokes, and the sight of the word NASTY flooding the screen when you fail to play a note properly feels like chaos, but it’s actually a carefully orchestrated recipe for endless good times and laughter. The real secret of <em>Trombone Champ</em>, though, is that the game is still actually fun. What might at first seem like a shallow premise designed just to spark some laughs is still the foundation for a well-designed rhythm game that can be mastered with skill and patience. It doesn’t hurt that you’ll have a lot of laughs on the way to success, though.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1585220/Melatonin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1585220/Melatonin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Melatonin</em></a></span>’s pastel color palette and laid-back vibes feel like they belong beside the lofi girl on YouTube. This rhythm game is all about relaxation. Its various levels offer dreamlike challenges to complete to the beat, free of distraction from any overwhelming interface. </p><p>As feels apt for a game about music, the cues you need to follow come almost entirely from the game’s soundtrack and animations. By paying attention to the game’s subtle cues, you’re able to deduce the proper button inputs. This gameplay works best in <em>Melatonin</em>’s remix levels which rearrange and merge past stages together in a beautiful cacophony of sounds and mechanics that isn’t just more interesting to listen to but more satisfying to play.</p></div><div><p>2015’s stellar <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a></span> takes the roguelike genre and adds a rhythm-based twist. Mostly this game plays as you might expect a roguelike to: you wander around dungeons full of enemies to fight and treasure to uncover while trying not to die, and you start your loop from the beginning each time. Here, however, your movement is done to the beat of the soundtrack. Through moving to the beat, you build up a scoring multiplier.</p><p>To make matters more interesting, enemies also move to the beat. They do this in predetermined patterns so watching and learning how every enemy moves becomes a key part of <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em>. Navigating the dungeons while fighting enemies who are moving erratically all around you and trying to keep your inputs in time with the beat becomes a fast-paced thrill ride. If you like roguelikes, you’ll be happy to know this is a very well-done take on the genre thanks to its strategic sonic twist.</p></div><div><p>What if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801"><em>Doom</em></a></span><em> </em>were also a rhythm game? Well, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286350/BPM_BULLETS_PER_MINUTE/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286350/BPM_BULLETS_PER_MINUTE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BPM: Bullets Per Minute</em></a></span> is probably what you would get. The musical first-person shooter sends you into hell to fight off hordes of enemies with your big guns while blasting some sick rock tunes. </p><p>Shooting has to be done on the beat in <em>BPM</em>, and successfully matching the rhythm boosts your score multiplier. As an incentive to stay focused, if you miss the beat your gun will misfire. This turns the game into a frantic twitch shooter that requires good aim, precise movement, and awareness of whatever song is currently being played. The game is also a roguelike, so you’ll be running through procedurally generated levels to take down enemies. If that sounds a bit like the previous entry on this list, that’s because <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em> was one of<em> BPM</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/bpm-bullets-per-minute/making-it-in-unreal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/bpm-bullets-per-minute/making-it-in-unreal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspirations</a></span>! Like that title, <em>BPM </em>excels at combining its two seemingly disparate elements to form one endlessly satisfying adventure.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bandai Namco’s mascot character seems to appear in the show as a robot complete with a scary Terminator-ass camera in his mouth.

An episode will be dedicated to what seems to be multiple games from Sony’s first-party studios rather than focusing on a single one. We can see <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s Jin Sakai, but it’s unclear just how or if they will interact. Are we getting the <em>PlayStation All-Stars </em>sequel we deserve through a television show?<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f8d5e854adfe17bc93810a51c813b1b" data-recommend-id="image://3f8d5e854adfe17bc93810a51c813b1b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man hits another man in the face with a bottle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man hits another man in the face with a bottle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f8d5e854adfe17bc93810a51c813b1b" data-recommend-id="image://3f8d5e854adfe17bc93810a51c813b1b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man hits another man in the face with a bottle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most easily recognizable franchises in <em>Secret Level </em>is Sloclap’s martial arts beat-em-up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-march-2024-games-sifu-destiny-2-ps5-ps4-1851294301&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-march-2024-games-sifu-destiny-2-ps5-ps4-1851294301"><em>Sifu</em></a></span>.

I’m most curious about the PlayStation Studios one because I’m interested to see just how deep down that well Amazon goes. Kratos and Jin in a crossover episode is fun enough, but for something with this big of a budget, I hope we see them really dive into the PlayStation catalog.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gamescom is here once again and host to some of the biggest games to release in the next couple of years. But away from all the big queues and questionable smells, a squirrel is nested and hidden away in the Indie area. You’ve likely already seen some viral videos of the game, but today, I sat down to play Squirrel With a Gun, a fantastic little Indie game development by three developers over the past couple of years. </p>



<p>The premise? You play as a squirrel hellbent on mayhem and as the name suggests, you have a gun (there’s a verity of different guns in the game from pistols to SMGs to rocket launchers). You’ll also be able to drive a miniature sports car, fly a drone, and use melee weapons, and even a cake. </p>

<h2 id="h-squirrel-with-a-gun-hands-on">Squirrel With A Gun Hands-On</h2>



<p>During my time playing I went through the tutorial and the pre-open world level to get a small taste of what’s to come on full release. The game instantly felt really good to play, with the use of using the guns recoil to assist with jumping and movement feeling natural to play. Gun recoil has also been used to make for some creative and hilarious enemy takedowns, too, and while I only used a couple of weapons during my hands on, each one left a smile on my face. </p>



<p>Squirrel with a Gun let’s you explore and cause havoc in an open world with platforming puzzle-like levels scattered throughout. The goal? Well to collect as many acorns as you can of course. Acorns and golden acorns are redeemed for more cosmetics, weapons, and more throughout the map which make for taking out agents even more hilarious. <br><strong><br></strong>Squirrel With a Gun is yet another Indie Must Buy for me. And priced at just $20, I think you’d be nuts not to give it a go, too. Squirrel With a Gun releases on August 29 on PC, with a Xbox Series S/X and PlayStation 5 release planned for this fall.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>"Google is horrible."</p><p dir="ltr">This was among the first things that Raccoon Logic creative director Alex Hutchinson said to me as I settled in to learn about his studio's newest game, Revenge of the Savage Planet. He followed this up with a promise to elaborate further as the presentation progressed. I would ultimately be shocked by how much of the nearly two-hour showcase and interview would be about this topic.</p><p dir="ltr">Raccoon Logic consists of a bunch of Montreal-based developers that, after working together on games like Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham series, went on to form Typhoon Studios in the late 2010s. In early 2020, that studio put out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/journey-to-the-savage-planet-video-review/2300-6452079/" data-ref-id="2300-6452079">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, an action-adventure game that was largely met with praise. Later that year, the studio was bought by Google to help bolster its video-game-streaming service Stadia.</p><p dir="ltr">In a matter of months--and nearly two years before the corporate conglomerate would shut down Stadia entirely--Typhoon Studios, along with all the other gaming teams that Google built from the ground up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-is-shutting-down-its-game-studios-impacting-150-people-including-jade-raymond/1100-6486978/" data-ref-id="1100-6486978">was closed</a>. Following this major blow, most of Typhoon regrouped to form Raccoon Logic, and set off on a mission to create not only the studio's first game, but a new entry in their Savage Planet series: Revenge of the Savage Planet. And yet, creating a new studio and brand-new title was only part of the challenge. According to studio head Reid Schneider, getting the Savage Planet IP back from Google took even longer than Typhoon's tenure as one of the company's first-party studios.</p><p dir="ltr">While studio closures are now a relatively common occurrence in the industry, both the team and the public at large were stunned by how quickly Google's gaming prospects collapsed in on itself. The company is notorious for killing off products with swiftness and precision--there is <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" rel="nofollow ">a whole website dedicated to the long list of services it has axed over the years</a>--but the size and scope of Stadia made it seem that the company might have given it more of a chance to gain some traction. Instead, it was tossed in the trash as unceremoniously as Google+ or Google Reader. And all of this forms the core of Revenge of the Savage Planet', the team at Raccoon Logic pouring their experience working for the company into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were a bit more upset, so it's a bit darker," says Hutchinson. In the Savage Planet sequel, the first game's corporation Kindred Aerospace has been gobbled up by an even-bigger conglomerate, Alta Interglobal. As a newly acquired employee, you've been sent on an intergalactic quest to help secure worlds for your new parent company. However, by the time you awaken from cryosleep 100 years later, you find out you've not only been laid off, but so has your entire team back home, stranding you in the deep recesses of space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354497-ss_e3529fda0f08d4ecba62feb4e16fbd71040b87aa.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354497" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354497-ss_e3529fda0f08d4ecba62feb4e16fbd71040b87aa.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354497"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354497-ss_e3529fda0f08d4ecba62feb4e16fbd71040b87aa.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While the game's narrative might have punches of more satirical, even darker comedy, Revenge of the Savage Planet's visuals are just as colorful and vibrant as its predecessor. However, instead of exploring a single savage planet, players will be traveling between multiple.</p><p dir="ltr">While visually the game is clearly more of what the first title offered, Unreal Engine 5 provides a noticeable graphical upgrade over Journey to the Savage Planet, and the team is hoping that the game's vivid fidelity will offer a nice contrast to the wealth of "dark and gritty" sci-fi games that currently dominate the medium. Another way the two games differ from one another is that the upcoming release is third-person--a fun animation in the early moments of Revenge literally shocking the player character out of first person into the new point of view.</p><p dir="ltr">The shift to third-person not only makes the semi-open world, puzzle-filled level design much more manageable, but allows for the game to have an even more distinct personality as well. The jaunty movement animation of the player character consistently brought a smile to my face during the game's hands-off demo.</p><p dir="ltr">This heightened level of amusing detail was consistent throughout the presentation of the game, with a particular moment where the player was swallowed by a large, orb-shaped creature and then managed to burst through from the inside by disco dancing, causing me to actually laugh out loud. Needless to say, if the first Savage Planet's humor and charm was something that endeared you to the game, Revenge is doubling, even tripling, down on that element.</p><p dir="ltr">This all goes hand in hand with a lot of the game's new mechanics, such as various substances changing up the friction of a planet's surface--if an alien explodes in a mound of goo, prepare to slide around if you step in it. Aliens can also be captured via a new lasso tool and then sent back to your crash pad, a customizable base that you can establish on each planet. Captured aliens can help the player complete certain objectives, and in some cases, unlock new cosmetics, something that the team can now feature thanks to the game's third-person nature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354498-rotsp_screenshot_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354498" data-ratio="0.56263498920086" data-width="3704" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354498-rotsp_screenshot_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354498"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354498-rotsp_screenshot_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game features a main story and two major side quests, with one about getting Kindred out from under the clutches of Alta. However, the team at Raccoon Logic wanted to put a greater emphasis on the player's story rather than the campaign that carries you throughout the game. Players will unlock planets in a specific order but can return to previously unlocked worlds anytime, especially as they gain new tools that can open up once inaccessible areas. While the game features five planets, we were only told about four, as the fifth is a secret that contains the true ending of the game and will force players to explore the rest of the worlds deeply in order to gain access to it.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of visual and gameplay enhancements, the team has added in various quality-of-life improvements. Those who played the first game will be happy to hear that Revenge features a map, which was the main complaint railed against Journey according to the devs. Journey's lack of a map was due to the fact that the team didn't want players to "be playing in the map," but this time around, they believe they've struck a good balance that will provide utility, but not have players simply checking off points on the atlas.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge features a jetpack for added mobility, something the team wanted to have in the first game but was axed by an anonymous Microsoft employee, according to Hutchinson, the conglomerate providing funding on Journey to the Savage Planet. Later in the game, there will be a "Spider-Man-esque" grapple that is apparently rather game-breaking but the team thought was too fun to leave out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354499-rotsp_screenshot_04.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354499" data-ratio="0.56263498920086" data-width="3704" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354499-rotsp_screenshot_04.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354499"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4354499-rotsp_screenshot_04.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">What's not in Revenge of the Savage Planet is almost as interesting as what is. In order to maintain a sustainable studio that is devoid of crunch, Raccoon Logic wanted to get the game into a playable alpha phase as quickly as possible and iterate from there, rather than spending an extended period testing out ideas and then rushing development as launch approached. There were originally some more linear, Zelda-esque dungeons, but the team felt they took away from the creative, spontaneous nature of the game's design, so they scaled those areas back. External base-building was scaled back as well. While you can get very granular in decorating the interiors of your crash pad, new structures you add to the compound simply drop out of the sky, almost like a "reward" for the player denoted the devs. The team also had some ideas for vehicles in the game, but they ultimately didn't make the cut. However, Hutchinson did tease their potential inclusion in DLC down the line.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite not being able to go hands-on with the game, it was clear that it's in a really solid place, with the dev team confirming that they're mostly in a polishing phase at this point in development. While they don't have a solid release date outside the first half of 2025 window, they stated that they're eager to ship the game and confident in their target. The team also confirmed that the game will not be a full-price title, but they're still figuring out the sweet spot for Revenge of the Savage Planet when it comes to pricing.</p><p dir="ltr">When the game does launch at that reduced price, it will be coming to PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>Raccoon Logic has unveiled its newest project, the Revenge of the Savage Planet, a sequel to the Sci-Fi adventure title Journey to the Savage Planet.</p>
<p>Raccoon Logic's upcoming title was showcased at the Opening Night Live pre-show and the Xbox Gamescom reveal. For those inspired by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">first game in the series</a>, the new sequel has brought in much more, building upon the same roots. This time, players will have access to a larger pool of content, including more new planets and gears and hundreds of secrets to uncover.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes in Revenge of the Savage Planet is the switch to a third-party perspective, an attempt to stay true to the series' initial inspirations. Interestingly, the devs have also added online co-op and crossplay within the title, allowing gamers to interact with anyone anywhere in the world, choosing them as their comrades for the whole journey. You can also play with a split screen if you are more inclined towards couch co-op.</p>
<p>Adding plenty of new content has brought the spotlight to the sequel. The game now features four new planets, including Stellaris Prime and Zephy, all equipped with unique environments and obstacles to provide gamers with a delightful experience. Here are the key features of Revenge of the Savage Planet, giving us a more vivid idea of what the sequel has in store for gamers:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Third-Person Online Co-Op &amp; Crossplay - Play with your best friend, partner or hellspawn on/or between any platform and now in third-person! You’ll be tasked with fully exploring and understanding these beautiful alien landscapes and uncovering its secrets.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Couch Co-Op with Split Screen: Experience the nostalgia-tinged joy of sitting on the same couch and playing on the same screen with someone you love, like the olden days, but with 100% more corporate satire.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Survive a FOUR Savage Planets - Populate your Kindex by exploring four large, vibrant worlds each with their own weird and wonderful plants and creatures. Scan everything, catalog everything, hopefully increase your science level… and you might even unlock new (yet still 4th best) gear! Plus… there may be more than four planets. Maybe.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Space Action &amp; Adventure - Run, Jump, Shoot, Grind, Stomp, Dodge, Slide, Lasso and Grapple your way through the world! While you’re at it you’ll also be experimenting with three different types of gameplay goo, most of which are highly flammable! Overcome challenging combat encounters with alien boss battles, suggestive fauna, problematic software and maybe even a greedy CEO.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Habitat &amp; Character Customization - Alien plants! Exciting gear! Weird rocks! Each planet is packed with nooks and crannies hiding all manner of rewards and secrets.&nbsp; While you’re at it you can even customize yourself,&nbsp; and your tiny habitat-like corner of the universe.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Collect Alien Creatures - Intergalactic Hoarders can also use their Lasso to Capture and Collect dozens of strange creatures, then go visit them once they’re relocated “happily placed” in Pens outside your customizable space trailer in scenic Nu Florida.&nbsp; After all, who is the real dangerous enemy, the corporate profiteers who fired you or a slimy exploding alien creature?</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>SAVAGE PLANET FRANCHISE - Originally released on Xbox, PS4, Epic Games Store, Steam, Stadia and Switch platforms enabling fun space adventures for millions of players across the globe.&nbsp; The original game earned multiple awards as a humorous, cooperative indie adventure, Then later Raccoon Logic developed the “Employee of the Month” version for Gen 9 consoles.&nbsp; Raccoon Logic Typhoon Studios captured the attention of press,creators and earned its Very Positive consumer ratings and Critics endorsements.&nbsp;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the release date of the upcoming sequel, Raccoon Logic says that they have targeted the early-ish 2025 timeline for PC and consoles, but they haven't provided an exact date for now. Overall, given the upcoming in-game content with Revenge of the Savage Planet, followed by the changes made in perspectives and mechanics, it's safe to say that Raccoon Logic does stand out in its own ways, and for the enthusiasts of the overall series, they are surely going to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Head out to the <a href="https://www.savageplanet.games/en-US#media">developer's official website</a> to find out more details about the title.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/jackbox-naughty-pack-delivers-fun-games-naughty-still-to-be-seen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-delivers-fun-games-naughty-still-to-be-seen.959790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/jackbox-naughty-pack-delivers-fun-games-naughty-still-to-be-seen<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's no secret that playing the <em>Jackbox Party Pack </em>is often a race to the bottom in terms of humor. Who will be the first to make that <em>'Cards Against Humanity' </em>style prompt and edge the rest of the group to devolve? With the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> players now get a chance to participate in three games where some of these edgier prompts are supplied by the game itself.</p>
<p>The <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack </em>comes with three games: M-Rated variations of previously existing Jackbox minigames and a brand-new one. The games included in this <em>Party Pack</em> are <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, </em>and <em>Let Me Finish.</em></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I had a chance to sit down with the developers of the <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em>, along with some industry peers not only to learn more about these games but also to get hands-on with them.</p>
<h2><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em></h2>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> is a reimagining of <em>Fakin' It</em>, a game that is still my favorite ever since its debut in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b4ae760-8c82-49a2-82d4-196d2e479e53" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-3-review-would-you-like-to-play-game"><em>Jackbox Party Pack 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>Among the group of players each is fed instructions to follow such as raising a number of fingers or making a face, one player is the Faker and will be fed incorrect prompts having to lie about their responses. The aim of this game is for the regular players to discover the faker, while the faker wins if they remain undetected for the longest amount of time.</p>

<p>Some of the prompts include questions about how often you might have gone to court or "Raise your hand if you think you could kill a raccoon in a fair fight."</p>
<p>A new addition to <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> is the addition of a Remote Play mode. Normally <em>Fakin' It </em>requires you to be in the same room as each other watching each others' reactions. This has meant that streamers haven't been able to play the game with their audience. With Remote Play those reactions and gestures have been replaced by emojis that players can select from their mobile device.</p>
<h2><em>Dirty Drawful</em></h2>
<p>In <em>Dirty Drawful</em> the players are all delivered a prompt to draw, after creating their 'masterpiece' that image is displayed to all other players who will decide what they believe the prompt is. Then the real prompt, along with the guessed prompts, are all posed to the group where points are awarded for getting the correct answer or tricking your friends.</p>

<p><em>Dirty Drawful</em> is the least changed of the games. It's still <em>Drawful</em>, where a prompt is delivered for a player to draw an image. But those images just might be a bit stranger. A prompt that I received was "Murder Super Fan" while another player got "Follow! That! Furry!"</p>
<p>The biggest change here is that an undo button has been added, no clear explanation was given for why this was the first time an undo button was being added to Drawful, perhaps it's a test for a later version or it's just with naughtier prompts they want to make sure if players feel like they've gone too far they can reel it back in.</p>
<h2><em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p>The new game in this party pack is<em> Let Me Finish</em>, a debate game where players are given a stock image and a weird open-ended prompt that they'll be able to answer and then debate over. Some of the example prompts were "Where is a mailbox's butt?" or "How does this avocado get aroused?"</p>
<p>This game promotes engaging with the game, as well as with one another as debate breaks out when everyone's different opinions are revealed and you can agree or vehemently disagree with each other.</p>

<p>A fun twist to this game is that if a player standing by thinks both players are completely wrong they can not only voice their opinion but add themselves to the prompt offering their own point of view for prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jumping in and telling players they're wrong has always been a fun part of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0f7b9d1-a12c-4c8c-835f-34ef4ff66814" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-10-review-decade-of-brilliance"><em>Jackbox Games</em></a>, but to be able to do it for points is just the cherry on top.</p>
<h2>How Naughty Is Naughty?</h2>
<p>While I wasn't expecting every prompt that we saw to be absolutely explicit or get anywhere close to the questionability of a home game, the prompts that I did see didn't feel like they broached very close to 'naughty'. I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time with the game to see just how wide a variety of prompts there are.</p>
<p>The most mature additions to the game are in the avatars and mascots of the games. The humans of <em>Fakin' It</em> might be shown in a bikini or censor bars, or you'll see the <em>Drawful </em>Owl looking thiccc or wearing a gimp suit. These themes do make me wonder if our 'random' prompts at this press event had been watered down for the sake of professionalism.</p>
<p>For the time being the prompts have maybe opened a gateway to naughtiness a bit faster than a normal game of <em>Jackbox</em>, but if you really want to set that tone it's still going to be the players doing the heavy lifting.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-wont-feature-full-italian-dub-despite-being-set-in-italy.959787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-no-italian-audio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like the recently-announced&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>won't feature a full Italian voiceover dub, despite the fact that it's set in Sicily and the fact that previous games in the series have offered Italian audio.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">the Steam page</a> for&nbsp;<em>The Old Country</em>, we can see that the game will offer a full dub in English, French, Spanish, and German, as well as Russian. Italian players, however, will have to content themselves with interface translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>A quick look at the Steam pages for the first three <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030830/Mafia_II_Definitive_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">games</a> in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360430/Mafia_III_Definitive_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">series</a> (or the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030840/Mafia_Definitive_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Definitive Edition remake of the first game</a>, at the very least) shows that they all feature a full Italian dub, making&nbsp;<em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>the first game in the franchise not to offer this convenience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-no-italian-audio-house.jpg?itok=oT5AwH8S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-no-italian-audio-house.jpg?itok=zBBEIngI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>'s lack of an Italian dub feels somewhat ironic.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that we don't know a whole lot about&nbsp;<em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>yet. It's possible that the lack of an Italian dub is due to translation complications; if characters speak both Italian and English in the game, for instance, a dub might be somewhat difficult to implement.</p>
<p>However, it's also ironic that the first game in the series that appears to take place entirely in Italy will lack an Italian dub. One would imagine the mafiosi depicted in the game would probably take umbrage with such a decision, amusing as it might be.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, it's the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series. Announced during yesterday's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase, the game is a prequel set during the 1900s, and it'll shine a light on the "brutal underworld" of the Sicily of that era.</p>

<p>Developer Hangar 13 and publisher 2K have promised more information to come regarding&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>this December, so stay tuned for more on that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to keep abreast of the game's progress, you can wishlist it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007134" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9P834N9S4LL0/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom</a> is exploding all around us, but there is still time to lower a pincer into the pile of Steam indie game announcements and reel up the occasional treasure. In this case, it's the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cupiclaw">Cupiclaw</a>, which is possibly the first ever "roguelike deckbuilding claw machine game". You know how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> made you feel about Joker cards? Well, this game wants to make you feel the same about claw machines. It's a terrible turn of events, frankly. I'm sorry for inflicting yet another potential bingeplay upon you. Here's a trailer. </p>

<p>The setup is that your character, Morris, has dropped his wedding ring in a claw machine, the classic first act twist in any Shakespearean tragedy. Specifically, he's dropped it in the arcade's most expensive claw machine. To earn the means to operate said ultra-pricey claw machine and retrieve the ring, he'll need to play all the other claw machines, converting his winnings into funds.</p>
<p>Why Morris doesn't just ask the arcade manager to open up the first claw machine and fetch the ring directly is a question for the soon-to-be-thriving Cupiclaw subreddit. Perhaps the arcade manager is a calculating Lothario who wishes to seduce Morris's spouse, while he's off playing at claw machines. Perhaps Morris's spouse is the manager. The moral of the story is: never let your spouse use a claw machine.</p>
<p>Anyway, in order to muster enough cash to scale the claw machine hierarchy, you'll also need to "level up" each individual machine by spending a portion of your earnings to restock it with new prizes, this being the deckbuilding aspect of the game. Prizes range from larger, plusher stuffed animals to puzzle pieces which earn you a bigger payout per piece, the more of them you amass.</p>
<p>The actual operation of each machine is straightforward - use A and D to move the claw left and right, hit spacebar to lower it. There's a timer to worry about, but if you rush you might accidentally bag objects such as crumpled soda cans that lower your final score. Like the soaring peregrine falcon, you must be discriminating yet swift.</p>
<p>All this is based on five minutes with Cupiclaw's demo. I can't say how complicated it'll get later on, but I'm hoping for a complex prize economy with plenty of variables and modifiers. The only thing I dislike about it is the overtly repetitive music. In that regard, at least, it's no Balatro.

Both installments, as well as the sequel, are on a pretty steep sale right now to celebrate the new game announcement. That means that you and your friends can jump into a bunch of horrifying (but still beautiful) zombie action and parkour jump-and-run all over the place for an outstanding price.</p><p><strong>You can net yourself both the definitive edition of the first <em>Dying Light</em> (which comes with every drop of DLC added to the game) and <em>Dying Light 2 </em>and its lone story DLC for $30. </strong>If the announcement for <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>has you gnawing at the bars of your enclosure, this is the single best deal you’re going to get on the whole series.</p><p><strong>On Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox, you can currently grab the first <em>Dying Light </em>game for just $4. This version only includes the base game, but it’s worth noting that some years ago, Techland made its only major expansion, <em>The Following</em>, completely free. </strong>So if you want to just catch up on Kyle Crane’s story, you can go this route and spare your wallet.</p><p>Though, I wouldn’t really recommend that route as Techland supported the <em>shit </em>out of that first game in the series when it became a rousing success. <em>Dying Light </em>had a season pass that included a year’s worth of DLCs, including a brand new mode and challenges as well as <em>The Following</em>. <strong>You can pick up these offerings in the enhanced edition of </strong><em><strong>Dying Light </strong></em><strong>which is also on sale on Steam right now for $9. </strong>Regrettably, this edition isn’t on sale on Xbox, <strong>but it </strong><em><strong>is </strong></em><strong>on PlayStation</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and the Nintendo Switch </strong>so if you’ve got that or a PC, you should be all set.</p><p>However, there’s also a final <em>definitive </em>edition of <em>Dying Light </em>that packs the base game, the expansion, the season pass DLC, all the cosmetics that were ever released for the game, and a final DLC that repurposes the aesthetic of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1706038022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1706038022">dark-fantasy game Techland was working on</a></span> for just one more dollar. <strong>Yep, the definitive edition of <em>Dying Light </em>is also available with all of that for 10 bucks on Steam.</strong> So if you want the most bang for your buck, that seems like the path to take.</p><p>If you’re uninterested in the story and just want to skip forward, or if you only played the first game, there’s good news: there’s a sequel that was only released a few years ago, and it’s <em>also </em>on sale. <em><strong>Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition </strong></em><strong>(what a mouthful) is the new base version of the game which also packs the story DLC, </strong><em><strong>Bloody Ties</strong></em><strong>. You can get the base version of </strong><em><strong>Dying Light 2 </strong></em><strong>for just $24 right now on Steam and Xbox.</strong> At the time of its release, Techland got a lot of flak for emphasizing that this game had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dying-light-2-will-take-500-hours-to-fully-complete-and-1848326833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-2-will-take-500-hours-to-fully-complete-and-1848326833">500 hours of content</a></span> if you maximized everything possible, so if that number sounds appealing to you, that sure sounds <em>worth </em>24 bucks.</p><p>If you know you’re going to want to play the upcoming game though, you may be interested in the ultimate edition of <em>Dying Light 2</em>, which comes with the base game, the DLC, and a bunch of extra goodies like skins, an artbook, and more. The real draw of the deal though is that folks who purchase this version get <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>for free, since it was originally supposed to be an expansion before ballooning into its own title. <strong>For the boldest of you, $63 dollars can get you the ultimate edition of </strong><em><strong>Dying Light 2 </strong></em><strong>(including future access to </strong><em><strong>Dying Light: The Beast</strong></em><strong>) on Steam and PlayStation.</strong></p><p>That’s more zombies and parkour than I think anyone could possibly ask for. I’ve never jumped into these games before, but I know that the folks who have generally love them. Given how well they’ve sold, I guess I can believe the hype. So if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LQh1UQXXE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LQh1UQXXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kicking a zombie in the head after free falling from a rooftop</a></span> sounds like a thing you might want to do (and which I believe is possible in these games) boy have I got the series for you to pick up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One day, he looked up from his drawing and there was a girl in front of him who looked just like the one on his canvas. She called herself a ‘sinner’ who came to this town to repent for her sins. Yuuto and the townspeople welcomed the girl, Ai, to their town.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Come spring, the entrance ceremony was underway. The new students took pictures and videos in front of the school with their parents to commemorate this special day. However, it was a depressing event for Yuuto, who lives alone after the death of his father and the abandonment by his mother and older sister. While he had gotten used to it, this time he suddenly felt very lonely due to the recent passing of grandmother, the sole close relative he had left.</p><p>Upon finding out about Yuuto’s loneliness, Ai confided that she was abandoned by her parents. She searched for a reason for living, whereas he ran away from reality through his imaginative drawings. Even though they were polar opposites, their backgrounds also made them quite similar. Gradually, they became closer to each other, while harboring secrets of their own.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">All eyes might have been on the Rev-8 land vehicle introduced to Starfield yesterday, but the update also provides another treat for the eyes. Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that Xbox Series X display settings are now matched on Series S. That means 60fps is available as an option on the smaller system.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1826009323342016643" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Bethesda detailed the visual enhancements as part of Starfield's August update. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-adds-vehicles-tonight-shattered-space-dlc-launches-in-september/1100-6525991/" data-ref-id="1100-6525991">the Rev-8 land vehicle and Shattered Space DLC release-date announcements</a> were the major highlights at Gamescom Opening Night Live, there is more meat on the bone with this new patch. For instance, Starfield players can now select from 30, 40, 60, and uncapped fps options if they're using a VRR display. Meanwhile, others can choose either 30fps or 60fps, including on Xbox Series S.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Starfield now offers the ability to "prioritize between Visuals and Performance while trying to maintain the frame rate target," per Bethesda. While the developer recommends picking Performance for 60fps and above, players aren't forced to do so. Meanwhile, shallow puddles should now sport better reflections, too.</p><p dir="ltr">This August update follows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/starfield-everything-new-in-the-june-update/2900-5461/#6" data-ref-id="2900-5461">the Starfield June update</a>, which introduced the Creations menu to the game alongside bounty boards and melee-weapon improvements.

The joystick is pitched as a wired companion to existing controllers, designed for people with "limited mobility."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It includes four button inputs on the front, a standard Xbox thumbstick, and two additional buttons that mimic the bumper and trigger placement on a traditional controller," explained Xbox in a blog post. "All these buttons are customizable, providing the flexibility to play in a way that’s most comfortable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on how it can be incorporated into different setups, Microsoft explained the joystick can be controlled with one hand, mounted via tabletops, or used with non-hand body parts. It can also be customized via button remapping or plugged directly into a console or PC to enable menu navigation and Nexus button functionality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The joystick is slated to launch in "early 2025" and is flanked by other accessibility devices and accessories, including new 3D printable files for adaptive thumbstick toppers–which have been released through Xbox Design Lab.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve listened to players express a need to have more options for thumbstick toppers to customize their play," reads the blog. "We collaborated with community members, charity organizations, and a hospital involved in adaptive gaming and 3D printing to design complimentary 3D printable files for adaptive thumbstick toppers with Xbox Design Lab."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The files include designs for six adaptive toppers that allow players to tweak the height and width of their thumbsticks. For example, a plate-shaped topper will provide a shallow, indented surface helpful for operating sticks with larger body parts. A sphere-shaped topper, meanwhile, can support alternative interactions such as grasps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are more where those came from. Microsoft has partnered with peripheral makers 8BitDo and ByoWave to introduce two new 'Designed for Xbox' controllers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 8BitDo Lite SE 2.4G Wireless Controller was created for players with limited mobility and features low-resistance buttons and sensitive 'Hall Effect' joysticks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"All&nbsp;buttons are conveniently accessible on the top of the controller, and it even has a non-slip silicone mat to keep it steady while gaming," said Microsoft."For ultimate gaming flexibility, the Lite SE can connect wirelessly with a 2.4G adapter or be wired directly to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or Windows 10 and above. It also includes two programmable Super Buttons that players can map without any extra software and are fully compatible with the Xbox Adaptive Controller."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ByoWave Proteus Controller is a modular interface that comes with highly customizable "snap and play" parts. Users can tweak the pad to match their unique play style, preferences, and physical needs by tinkering with over 100 million different combinations. "The module mapping system makes it easy to save and switch configurations, so players can experiment with different set-ups hassle free," added Microsoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more information, including launch dates and pricing,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-accessibility-adaptive-joystick-thumbstick-toppers/"> check out Xbox Wire</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, THQ Nordic announced that Early Access for Titan Quest II is on the horizon. It will be available to interested players in the Winter of 2024/2025. This title is being developed by Grimlore Games, known for detailed fantasy games such as SpellForce 3 and Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>This game will allow players to dive into a deep world of fantasy, where they experience what it means to rival a God. The first Titan Quest game was released in 2006, and it then received an anniversary edition of the game in 2016, merging both the Titan Quest game and Titan Quest Immortal Throne into one game.</p>
<p>THQ Nordic first announced Titan Quest II's development in August 2023. Players can dive into Early Access this coming Winter. There is no news on how much this upcoming ARPG will cost, but the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Whether Titan Quest II's Early Access will also be available on console hasn't been clarified, but it's safe to assume it'll be available on PC via Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225171/asus-wi-fi-7-gaming-router-rog-rapture-gt-be19000-rt-be86u-usb-be92-adapter-windows-laptop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus announced <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-wifi-7-devices-gamescom-2024/">three new Wi-Fi 7 products</a> today, including a tri-band ROG Rapture GT gaming router, a dual-band router, and a new Wi-Fi 7 USB adapter.</p><p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/networking/rog-rapture-gt-be19000/">ROG Rapture GT-BE19000</a> has a familiar ’80s retro-future look shared by predecessors like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23745096/i-have-never-been-so-convinced-that-a-router-was-going-to-come-alive-and-murder-me">quad-band GT-BE98</a>, along with most of the same specs, including two 10Gbps and five 2.5Gbps ethernet ports. It also supports 320MHz channel bandwidth on the 6GHz band, which unlocks much higher throughput (although you’ll need a 2Gbps or higher connection to your ISP for that to shine). </p><div><figcaption><em>The ROG Rapture GT-BE19000 has seven ethernet ports.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><p>Since the GT-BE19000 uses Wi-Fi 7’s multilink operation feature, you<strong> </strong>can connect a supported device to<strong> </strong>the 6GHz and 5GHz band at the same time for increased throughput, less latency, and more stability. </p><p>Asus’ other new router is the comparatively modest dual-band <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fnetworking-iot-servers%2Fwifi-routers%2Fasus-wifi-routers%2Frt-be86u%2F">RT-BE86U</a>. It’s Wi-Fi 7, so it can support multilink operation across the 2.4GHz and 5Ghz bands. It also has a 10Gbps WAN port for connecting to your modem or fiber ONT, along with four 2.5Gbps ethernet ports for wiring up your gaming PC and whatnot.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The RT-86U, a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Stick this in your PC and download with it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div></div><p>Finally, Asus announced the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/networking/rog-usb-be92/spec/">ROG USB-BE92</a>, an external USB Wi-Fi 7 card. It connects using USB-A or USB-C, and Asus says it should work with Windows 10 or 11 PCs out of the box — just plug it in and go. It’s an easy way to add Wi-Fi 7 to a computer once you’ve upgraded to a Wi-Fi 7 router, unlocking features like MLO for better stability and faster throughput. </p><p>Asus didn’t announce any release dates or prices for these devices. </p><div><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23902812/wi-fi-7-explained">What is Wi-Fi 7</a>?</h4></p><p>Wi-Fi 7 is the next version of Wi-Fi to follow Wi-Fi 6E. Like Wi-Fi 6E, the protocol works on the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, and it’s backward-compatible with devices that precede it. Wi-Fi 7 promises higher throughput, with features like 320MHz channel bandwidth (twice what’s offered on Wi-Fi 6E), Multi-Link Operation (which combines bands into one for greater throughput and more stability), and improved interference handling.</p><p>More Wi-Fi 7 routers have hit the market and prices are beginning to come down, though it’s still early days. Even if your devices don’t support it yet, you may benefit from Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems, which will be able to take advantage of the features listed above for faster, more stable wireless backhaul connections between nodes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
