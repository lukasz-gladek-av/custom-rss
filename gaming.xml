                <p>Building a gaming PC is kind of like building a hot rod--sure, the parts that make the car go fast are important, but if you're going to spend all that time on it, shouldn't it look cool, too? As such, PC gamers who build their own systems love to look for the PC case that fits their aesthetic. Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan, is where PC case-makers go to show off the chassis they'll be selling throughout the year. Some are purely cosmetic, while others put function over form, but many are fascinating. It's important to note that, due to the international trade situation caused by U.S. tariffs, the availability of some new computing items is in question. That said, here are some of the cases we loved from the show.</p><h3>Hyte X50 Air</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNMBD7S3AGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jNMBD7S3AGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hyte has become a prominent name in PC cases in the last couple of years, and the <a href="https://hyte.com/events/computex?utm_campaign=computex2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X50 Air</a> makes it easy to see why. With its rounded edges and unique color options--lavender, matcha, pink, and red to go with the standard black and white variants--the design language calls to mind the iMacs of yore.</p><p>In the interview with Gamers Nexus in the video above, HYTE Product Director Rob Teller explains just how hard it is to put an airflow-friendly mesh onto a curved surface, as they've done with this case. He shows off a variety of failed test models, including one with metal so soft that it began to rust in a week and another where the edge of the mesh acted more like a "tear here" perforation line. The end product, though, is a truly unique-looking case with gentle curves inside and out.</p><p>This case isn't available quite yet, but HYTE has a bunch of other great cases already on the market, such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKW889MJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyte Y70</a>, which offers a number of fun colorways, including the pink one pictured below, but with fewer curves. This one retails for $239.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499266,1300-4499267,1300-4499268,1300-4499269,1300-4499270,1300-4499271" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg"></figure><h3>Silverstone FLP02</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Kmo8RPrmo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z5Kmo8RPrmo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The case makes for an interesting blend of retro aesthetics with modern adaptations. The inside of the case is spacious enough to fit beefy GPUs and AIO coolers up to 360mm. The front of the case features one USB Type-C, two USB Type-A ports, and a combo audio jack hidden under a magnetic flap, as well.</p><p>But it also makes use of standard features seen on those old PC cases. There's a working lock on the front of the case that locks the power button. The Turbo button, used to overclock old CPUs back in the PC stone age, will now allow you to manually crank up your fan speed. The front of the case also has space for three 5.25-inch drives. The floppy disk-style dummy pieces can be left in place if you're one of the 99% of PC gamers who hasn't used an optical drive in more than a decade (not scientifically verified), but you can indeed slot 5.25-inch optical drives into those spots, if you like.</p><p>The original ultra-retro FLP01 was a very popular case for Silverstone, and the company <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/silverstone-reveals-the-flp02-late-80s-style-tower-pc-case-proudly-beige-but-thoroughly-modern-inside" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told Tom's Hardware</a> that it plans to make a lot of these cases to keep up with demand. The FLP02 will retail later this year for $220 in the U.S. If you're looking for another retro case, there isn't really anything like it on the market except for SilverStone's FLP01, which the company has a hard time keeping in stock. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-All-Metal-Radiator-SST-FA514X-WG/dp/B0D9PQ35CF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SilverStone FARA 514X</a>, priced at $129, is another ATX mid-tower-sized case with plenty of room and a more modern design.</p><h3>Cooler Master MasterFrame 360 Panoramic</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHwd-PQbRjg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="466">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MHwd-PQbRjg?start=466" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PC builders are no strangers to building aesthetically-appealing PCs, as cases have featured tempered glass panels for decades, but recent innovations have brought us things like fish-tank-style cases and curved glass corners to really show things off. If you're <em>really</em> confident in your building skills, though, you can show off to the world with Cooler Master's MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, which offers a continuous view into your PC case from the front and both sides. You'll have to manage your cables carefully if you want to make the best use of this chassis.</p><p>There's also a variant of the MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, called the AK Mods X Bounce, that puts a stage on the front of the case, backed by an LCD screen. The idea with this variant is to let you put something there--Batman, Sephiroth, Hello Kitty, or whatever your favorite action figure is--and then give it an animated background to stand in front of. We're expecting lots of cool mods to come out of this particular option. Cooler Master has not yet revealed availability or price, however.</p><p>It seems we'll be waiting a bit for the MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-MasterFrame-Open-Air-Panoramic/dp/B08T5PRCCN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cooler Master's MasterFrame 700</a> will do an equally good job of putting your PC on display to admire, albeit without the curved glass. We're betting it's less expensive than the 360 Panoramic, too, at $191.</p>

        <p>As part of big update for all platforms.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is boldly going where no nine-year-old exploratory space sim has gone before: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. Developer Hello Games has announced a free launch-day update that'll bring significant upgrades compared to the original Switch release, including enhanced visuals, multiplayer, and more. That's in addition to a major update for all platforms arriving today.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Switch 2, Hello Games says this new version of No Man's Sky is a "huge leap" over the original Switch release, featuring "massively" increased density and detail, plus higher resolutions and improved frame rates (the <a href="https://youtu.be/cgYYQwHuh-Y">studio's announcement video</a> suggests 40fps at 1080p while playing portable, and 30fps at 1440p in docked mode).
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 also gets multiplayer and settlements - two features missing on Switch 1 - as well as cross-save and cross-play, so it's possible to jump seamlessly between devices. No Man's Sky's Switch 2 upgrade is free to existing users and launches alongside the console on 5th June.

<p>
It'll also include <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update">No Man's Sky's new Beacon update</a>, which arrives today, 4th June, on all other platforms. This provides a significant overhaul of the space sim's existing settlement system, which essentially enables players to become the mayor of their own Mos Eisleys.
</p>
<p>There are new robotic settlements, for instance, and it's now possible to own multiple settlements instead of just one. There's also suggestion of more granular customisation and management, with talk of new upgradeable buildings types and settlement features, ranging from custom starship merchants to fishing ponds. That's alongside citizens with their own stories and abilities, and the option to enlist wingmen to protect your settlements from pirates. All of which sounds wonderful, but if the update wipes out the sprawling, settlement-adjacent cliffside base I've spent the last two years building, I will 100 percent cry.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, No Man's Sky's Beacon update is out today on PC, PCVR, Steam Deck, PlayStation 4, PS5, PSVR, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 1, with a Switch 2 update due tomorrow, 5th June. And as Hello Games is fond of teasing, "more will follow". But what of the developer's next game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">planetary sim Light No Fire?</a> It's been a while since we've had an update on that, so fingers crossed for a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> news.

			<p>Over the last year or so, Hello Games has secretly prepared a Nintendo Switch 2 version of No Man's Sky that will be available when <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the console</a> launches tomorrow.</p>
<p>According to the independent British studio, this new version is a massive improvement over the existing Switch version, which, in their own words, pushed that console's hardware to the absolute max of its capabilities. For instance, it was possibly the only game to support AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 on the platform.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the Nintendo Switch 2, No Man's Sky includes its full multiplayer functionality (which the first Switch lacked), including cross-save and cross-play. The density, level of detail, resolution, and frame rate are all significantly higher. Textures are now in higher resolution, and pixel density has been increased in both TV and handheld modes. The UI's resolution has been improved, too, and this version also supports the touchscreen and gyro controls.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgYYQwHuh-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But there's also a new No Man's Sky update out today on all platforms. Titled BEACON, it greatly overhauls settlements and even adds the ability for players to become a town's mayor, taking ownership of multiple settlements. They can construct and upgrade buildings, including new types such as jukebox bars where players can choose the music, merchants where they can build custom starships, and ponds where they can relax and fish.</p>
<p>Each inhabitant can be conversed with. They have their own abilities and attributes, too. As mayor, you will be responsible for welcoming new settlers, resolving disputes and making choices to create prosperity. A well-managed settlement can make its owner rich in resources, but it needs to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen to defend towns when they are attacked by roaming pirates.</p>

<p>This is the 38th named update for No Man's Sky. Following the underwhelming launch in 2016, there's no doubt that Hello Games has more than redeemed itself, as evidenced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very positive user reviews.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-released-switch-2-edition-confirmed.1206609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>by the name of Beacon, and what's more, the studio has also announced that the game is getting a Switch 2 Edition upgrade on Nintendo's new console.</p>

<p>Beacon follows on from major&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>updates like March's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-relics-update" rel="nofollow">Relics</a> and January's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update" rel="nofollow">Worlds Part 2</a>, and it's on a pretty similar scale to those updates, adding some pretty major features to the game.</p>

<p>First up, the settlement system has been overhauled; you can now become the overseer of "multiple planetary settlements", according to Hello Games, and the systems for things like base management, upgrades, and decision-making have also been improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-running.jpg?itok=agxaBPVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-running.jpg?itok=zH0jmtKJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s new Beacon update is bringing a major overhaul to settlements.</figcaption></figure><p>You can now also view your settlements' history and achievements thanks to "improved record-keeping", which will also show you the happiness of the citizens who live in your settlements, as well as other stats.</p>

<p>Not only that, but disputes between those citizens have also been overhauled, with more resolutions now available to you when citizens have a disagreement in your settlements. If you want to see why those disagreements got started, you can check the new settler personality info page.</p>

<p>There are tons of other changes to&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s settlement system as part of the Beacon update, and plenty of other features have been added as well. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes via the game's official website</a> for more info.</p>

<p>As well as the Beacon update, Hello Games has also revealed that a Switch 2 Edition upgrade is coming for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, and it adds some features that are missing in the original Switch version.</p>




<p>First and foremost, multiplayer will be available in the Switch 2 version, as will settlements. Both features are missing from the Switch version of the game.</p>

<p>Of course, the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>will also boast better visuals and performance, as well as touch controls, gyro aiming, and cross-save support. What's more, the Switch 2 upgrade will be entirely free.</p>

<p><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s Beacon update is available for the game right now. You can check out&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, with the Switch 2 version on the way tomorrow.</p>

            <p>If you found the feudal festival of backstabbing that was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> distressingly upbeat and wholesome, perhaps you'll be more impressed by Never's End, a new turn and grid-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny</a>'s former lead sandbox gameplay designer Ryan Jucket with character designs from Final Fantasy artist Masayoshi Nishimura.</p>
<p>It takes place in a world swamped by creeping undead darkness, and casts you as a warrior spirit wrought of deathless silver. Taking charge of the last surviving village, you will possess and burn away the very souls of townsfolk in order to transform them into battlefield units. Careful, though, because the more villagers you catch in your mirrors and reduce to living weapons, the stronger the Never becomes.</p><!--more-->

<p>If that were all there were to Never's End, I might have given it a miss. The other source of intrigue here is that battles put a big emphasis on using spells to modify the terrain and atmospheric conditions. "Temperature, weather, wind, water level, and even the density of the earth beneath your feet can all be manipulated to gain the advantage in combat," observes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999930/Nevers_End/">the Steam page</a>. "Drain rivers dry or flood the battlefield. Create rain and fog to hamper your enemies, or mighty winds to hurl them over cliffs. Freeze your foes or set them aflame. Reshape earth to gain the high ground, or melt it into deadly lava."</p>
<p>Sounds like a jolly time. The last tactical RPG I played that meddled with the air and soil this extravagantly was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a>, and I've been hankering for a similar feat of geomancy. I'm also quite sold on the art style, which suggests a handsome Dreamcast remake of a PS1 game.</p>
<p>Going by the launch description, the campaign will give you the choice of when to mount an assault on the heart of the Never, which pumps out fresh boglins at regular intervals. There's an open-ended overworld full of jungles, deserts and tundra where you'll go on hunting missions and pick through the treasures of a forgotten golden age. Very Destiny-ish, indeed.</p>
<p>"Cleanse corrupted settlements, awaken long-dormant temples, unearth lost technology, and then reap the rewards as civilization rebuilds in your wake," comments the Steam page. The rebuilding theme extends to the founding of new towns, each a source of (willing?) husks for your zombo war effort.</p>
<p>Are you the real villain here? Well, put it this way: when you're felled in combat, you're reborn at HQ as a rapidly congealing pool of liquid silver. The last time I saw somebody do that it was the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and he did not strike me as promising village management material. If you enjoy the foulness of all this but can't abide grid-based battlers, maybe check out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p><strong>Update Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Oversee Multiple Settlements</strong> – Become Overseer of up to four settlements, managing townships on the frontier of multiple worlds—each with their own set of citizens and challenges. Govern your settlers wisely and invest in their infrastructure to enable each settlement to flourish, producing lucrative resources, and becoming an invaluable base of operations throughout your journey.</li><li><strong>Historical Records</strong> – As Overseer, review a history of your settlement’s accomplishments and statistics achieved throughout your tenure. Improved record-keeping now documents your influence on your citizens’ happiness, the number of sentinel attacks successfully repelled, new infrastructure constructed, and more.</li><li><strong>Pyrotechnic Spectacles</strong> – Significant events in a settlement—including festivals, new citizens, successful expeditions, building constructions, and more—will now prompt the settlers to celebrate with fireworks in the town centre.</li><li><strong>Autophage Settlements</strong> – Discover rare Autophage settlements, populated by secretive robotic lifeforms and assembled from scrap and crystal. Travellers who have encountered the Autophage can join these settlements as Overseer, and those who have earned their trust may receive a special invitation…</li><li><strong>Inspect Building Details</strong> – Inspect settlement structures from their building details terminal. Each building provides an ongoing contribution to the settlement’s productivity and happiness levels, and some can provide special features to boost the entire settlement.</li><li><strong>Weathered Construction Materials</strong> – Adopt a rustic aesthetic for your bases with new sets of weathered and rusted surfaces. Applicable to all existing timber, stone, and alloy structural components—as well as the new salvaged components.</li><li><strong>Deep Settlement <a title="Genres > Management [28 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> – The underlying systems controlling settlements have been completely reworked for greater choice and depth. Every building now has its own calculated contribution to the happiness, population and productivity of the settlement, making construction choices more important than ever. Choose carefully which buildings to upgrade as you specialize your construction efforts to improve your citizens’ lives—or their revenues…</li><li><strong>Settler <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lities</strong> – Conversing with your settlers can now reveal an information page about each of them—providing insight into their personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and quirks—as well the skills of any specialists such as bakers or musicians.</li><li><strong>Citizen Dilemma Improvements</strong> – Citizen disputes have been completely reworked and expanded, removing ambiguity from the scenarios described and presenting the Overseer with a much wider pool of resolutions. Determine your own moral stance on the quarrels of your citizens—or fine them all if everybody is at fault!</li><li><strong>Customize Your Settlement</strong> – Settlement buildings can now be upgraded to higher classes, increasing their utility, enhancing their appearance, granting them a more prestigious name, and raising the overall status of your township.</li><li><strong>Autophage Settlers</strong> – Some of the highly enigmatic Autophage have built settlements of scrap metal and Atlantideum—where they live safely cloaked, only visible when scanned with specialist technology. The thoughts of these secretive robotic lifeforms are their own, with only fragments of meaning understandable to their Overseer.</li><li><strong>Squadron Defends Your Settlement</strong> – Travellers who have recruited pilots to their squadron now benefit from additional defenses against pirate raids, as brave pilots scramble their ships to defend the settlement.</li><li><strong>Exosuit Voice Options</strong> – The Exosuit AI narrating your journey can now speak with a masculine voice—or be silenced entirely.</li><li><strong>Settlement Fishing</strong> – Relax at the water’s edge of settlement fishing ponds, reeling in bigger and juicier catches with each upgrade of the pool.</li><li><strong>Richer Citizen Guidance</strong> – A variety of new management decisions are available to the Overseer, reflecting the consequences of previous choices. Blessings and specialist workers will return to benefit the settlement, and other new scenarios will arise—such as commissioning artwork or helping name a newborn citizen.</li><li><strong>Custom Resource Production</strong> – Settlements that are clear of debt now have a far greater range of options for resource production. Each resource is now tied to particular buildings’ upgrade levels, allowing Overseers who develop farming, industrial or trade specialisms a greater range of materials. Manufactured resources are now directed by the Overseer instead of automatically assigned. Return to a thriving settlement to harvest its resources to assist your journey—or export them for sale on the galactic exchange.</li><li><strong>An Essential Base of Operations</strong> – Structures at your settlement now offer deeper interactivity and gameplay. Converse with Guild envoys at marketplaces, probe deep space from towers, determine the soundtrack at the saloon, deconstruct starships at landing pads, purchase new Multi-Tools from factories—and much more.</li><li><strong>Intel XeSS</strong> – Intel Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) uses machine learning for real-time upscaling—enabling both higher performance and exceptional image quality for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,296 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> players.</li><li><strong>Player Voice Options</strong> – Player vocalizations—such as breathing or exertions when running—can now be customized to several different voice types, varying in pitch and character.</li><li><strong>The Vile Brood Seeks Hosts</strong> – The dangers that threaten a planetary settlement are now much more varied. Sentinel forces seeking to eliminate settlements now include waves of repair drones, summoners, heavy, corrupted, and standard drones—leading to more interesting and tactical combat encounters. The vile insect queen and her brood have also developed a new “curiosity” about these deliciously-populated points of interest…</li><li><strong>Autophage Base Parts</strong> – Visit the Space Anomaly to obtain a multitude of new structural and decorative Autophage base parts, and construct your own base in their hard sci-fi aesthetic.</li><li><strong>Settlement Event Balance</strong> – Sentinel incursion events have been rebalanced, so that settlements call their Overseer to return and defend them less frequently. The range of citizen and management decisions settlers can ask your guidance on has been expanded, and the rewards for doing so have been adjusted to be more enticing to a busy Overseer. The range of stat-boosting special features a settlement can acquire has been tripled to eighteen.</li><li><strong>Survey Your Empire</strong> – Use the Quick Menu to access the Settlements Register from anywhere, allowing an Overseer to quickly assess the status of all their managed settlements. View debt progress, production status, and history—and even retire as Overseer.</li><li><strong>Settlements Influence System Economy</strong> – A flourishing settlement benefits an entire solar system, with the local economy receiving a boost from its wealth.</li><li><strong>Improved Snapping</strong> – The mechanism for snapping structural base parts together has been revisited, greatly improving the building experience when placing floors and roofs.</li><li><strong>Cross-Save Full Release</strong> – The Cross-Save feature is now available to all players, allowing you to seamlessly continue your journey across any platforms running <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. To transfer your save data across platforms, read more about Cross-Save and connect your platform accounts here.</li></ul></blockquote><p>And here are the full patch notes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Autophage Settlements</strong></p><ul><li>Added rare Autophage settlements, with uniquely Autophage names, to all inhabited planets.

You’ll not only need to be faster than your opponents but also sneakier.</li></ul><p>Along with new levels and antics in player-versus-player players will also be able to don eight new character skins inspired by <em>Monaco: What’s Yours is Mine</em>.

            <p>Gather your ghost hunting crew, but this time rather than grabbing your torches and crucifixes, reach out for some popcorn instead - a film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is on its way.</p>
<p>The upcoming film based on the psychological horror co-op game will be a collaboration between developer Kinetic Games, as well as Blumhouse and Atomic Monster, which will be producing.</p>
<p>Blumhouse is known for its horror films, with the likes of M3gan and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> to its name. Atomic Monster, meanwhile, is the production company behind Annabelle, The Nun and The Conjuring universe (which is the "most successful horror franchise" of all time).</p>

<p>"We're thrilled to officially announce that a Phasmophobia film adaption is in development - it's a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting," said Kinetic Games director Daniel Knight.</p>
<p>"We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond. Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can't wait to share more as the project develops."</p>
<p>Phasmophobia joins the swathes of games receiving film versions in recent years. Until Dawn was adapted for the big screen in April, but featured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">both a new cast of characters and a new story</a>.</p>
<p>As for Phasmophobia, it has surpassed 23m in global sales since its early access debut. Its next content drop - known as Chronicle - will be released on 24th June. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-junes-update-reworks-the-journal-media-and-brings-a-total-overhaul-of-evidence-collection">This will be Phasmophobia's "biggest update yet"</a>, the team said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-games-hires-horror-game-specialist-louise-blain">journalist and radio host Louise Blain joined Blumhouse Games as its creative lead</a>, as the company brings its horror expertise to gaming.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 day one update has started rolling out, enabling network features, playing original Switch games on the system, and more.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-20-1-1-update-out-now-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Everything</a>, the new update enables all network features that were previously not available for those lucky enough to get a unit before the official release, such as using original Switch games, Nintendo Switch Online, GameChat, Virtual Game Cards, uploading screenshots and videos, linking with the Nintendo Switch App to view them, and more. With the network features going live, the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop has also gone live.</p>
<p>The wait has been long, but the next-generation Nintendo system is almost here, and soon enough, players from all over the world will be able to experience its launch titles, which include Mario Kart World and plenty of third-party ports. Among these ports, the most impressive will likely be the Cyberpunk 2077 port, which is also among the first Nintendo Switch 2 games to use<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> NVIDIA DLSS</a> to improve image quality and performance. According to CDPR VP of Technology, the upscaler, alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ram-storage-dlss-push-past-playstation-4/">RAM and the system's storage</a>, are the features that allow the console to surpass the PlayStation 4 system, which was made evident by the fact that the developer was able to release the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>, which ended up skipping last-generation consoles due to technical limitations.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 officially launches tomorrow, June 5th, worldwide, with some exceptions, like China and Central America.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-movie-adaptation-in-the-works-at-blumhouse.1206552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Horror film studio Blumhouse and&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>developer Kinetic Games have announced that the spooky multiplayer horror game is getting its very own movie adaptation.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the movie will be a co-production between Blumhouse and James Wan's production company Atomic Monster, whose works include&nbsp;<em>The Conjuring</em>&nbsp;and its associated spinoffs, as well as&nbsp;<em>M3GAN&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Malignant</em>. Of course, Kinetic Games is also involved in the production.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>lead developer Daniel Knight says the movie is "a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting", promising to share more "as the project develops" (although stopping short of a timeline for said info).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse-room.jpg?itok=QfOmcXQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse-room.jpg?itok=tjz7g5CK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blumhouse is producing a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>movie.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet have a release window for the movie, nor do we know who any of the creative personnel involved with it will be. We'll likely have to wait quite a while before we learn things like the director, the writers, and the stars of the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>movie, unfortunately.</p>

<p>What we do know, however, is that this is just one of several video game movies that have been greenlit recently, and it's not even the only one in the horror space, either.</p>

<p>Back in April, it was revealed that a movie based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">horror work sim&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">The Mortuary Assistant</a>&nbsp;</em>is in development, and, of course, Sony recently released a movie based on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-movie-first-look" rel="nofollow">interactive narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>AI Darth Vader was a huge hit in <em>Fortnite</em>, and now Epic plans to let creators make AI-powered NPCs for their own in-game experiences. But a senior Epic exec says that creators should expect a “learning curve” when using them — something Epic had to figure out on its own.</p><p>The AI Vader that Epic made lets users talk to the character using their voice and hear an AI-generated version of James Earl Jones’s Vader voice talk back. It was the “culmination of a very intense effort for a character everybody understands,” Saxs Persson, Epic’s EVP of the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem, tells <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p>But Epic couldn’t just set an AI chatbot loose — “a lot” went into defining how Vader reacted and dialing in the voice. The work was worth it, though; in-game, Vader’s voice sounds just like the movies, and when he’s on your team, he’s a menacing, aggressive force. Persson says that Vader was ultimately “integrated into gameplay in a way that every player could understand” and he hopes creators are able to make similar things.</p><p>Vader’s rollout wasn’t perfect; a popular streamer, Loserfruit, was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">get Vader to swear</a>, which Epic fixed shortly after it happened. Persson says that it was a “learning experience” and that the team has built multiple layers of how it does its safety checks.</p><p>Epic also tries to build systems to prevent those kinds of things and be able to react fast. “We do our best job on day one,” Persson says. “But more importantly, we’re ready to surround the problem and actually have fixes in place as fast as we can.” Creators making AI NPCs for <em>Fortnite</em> will have access to the same safety tools that Epic did for Vader.</p><p>At Unreal Fest on June 3rd, the company showed a live demo of an AI NPC called Mr. Buttons, whose only purpose was, using its voice, to try and convince the player to push a giant red button. It was a simple, effective, and funny demo that showed what’s possible. The goal was to create a scenario where “the responses are literally endless” so that “everybody has a different experience,” Persson says.</p><p>Persson wouldn’t say if or when Epic plans to bring more AI NPCs to <em>Fortnite</em>. He says that Epic didn’t give its designer some kind of “AI objective” when making Vader. “Our objective is fun,” CEO Tim Sweeney says. “AI is just another tool they have now,” Persson adds. It sounds like AI characters could show up in Epic and Disney’s “persistent universe” that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">in the works</a>, too: “I would imagine that AI plays a role,” Persson says, noting that it would help with immersion.</p><p>Persson wouldn’t share a timeline for when the universe, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">announced last year</a>, might be available. But Epic is going to let creators make their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678399/epic-games-fortnite-ai-darth-vaders-tech-creators">own <em>Star Wars-</em>themed experiences</a>, so perhaps somebody will create another take on an AI Darth Vader.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-top-10m.1206540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>has topped a major sales milestone, and no, you're not reading that wrong; I do mean <i>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</i>and not&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1930202980927623265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>X account,&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>director Yoshitake Suzuki says the expansion has "finally surpassed" the 10 million sales mark, which means that it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-13-million-sales" rel="nofollow">picked up another four million sales or so</a> for itself in the last two years.</p>

<p>As a reminder, at <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, the base&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>game itself stood at around 17.1 million sales. It's pipped to the post by&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>, which, at 21.5 million units sold, is still the best-selling game in the series (and Capcom's best-selling title overall).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m-celebration.jpg?itok=xVd1ZQAz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m-celebration.jpg?itok=UoNxLWMf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>is still picking up sales for itself.</figcaption></figure><p>Neither of these games is the latest in the series, however; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which launched across PC and current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in late February</a>.</p>

<p>On release, the game quickly broke Capcom records, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">amassing eight million sales</a> within a three-day period. In late March,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">broke ten million sales</a>, and that's where it still stood at last count, although I wouldn't be surprised if it's picked up a lot more sales for itself since then.</p>

<p>Continuing sales for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>suggest that it's not just&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>that's doing very well for Capcom, but the series as a whole. It is, after all, one of Capcom's biggest moneyspinners, alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">the <em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em>, it's the sole major expansion for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, introducing new areas, new monsters, and more to the game.</p>




<p>The expansion was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">released back in mid-2022</a>, a few months after the PC release of the base game and a few months before it would land on consoles other than the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> won't include a 200cc mode for faster racing, but producer Kosuke Yabuki hasn't ruled it out for a post-launch addition. </p>
<p>Mario Kart World is the next entry in Nintendo's long standing series, however unlike the games that have gone before, this time the team is mixing things up with the introduction of a roamable interconnected, well, world.</p>
<p>But, while the upcoming release will feature some newness on its debut, that 200cc is one feature from previous series entry <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8">Mario Kart 8</a> that will not arrive on launch.</p>

<p>This mode is often seen as a higher difficulty level for players as it can result in more frantic races due to the increased speed and power of karts. It's a lot of fun, especially after the comparatively tame 50, 100 and 150cc modes.</p>
<p>But, even though 200cc won't be available on launch, fret not. The 200cc mode was introduced to World's predecessor as part of an update following the game's initial launch, and the same may well happen again here.</p>
<p>"Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes like this," Mario Kart World's producer told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/">Rolling Stone</a>, before coyly adding:</p>
<p>"However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet."</p>
<p>Is this something you hope to see added to Mario Kart World further down the road?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cdpr-clarifies-that-the-demo-was-not-the-witcher-4-gameplay-confirms-there-were-no-changes-to-ciris-design/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Only a short time after the third installment's tenth anniversary, yesterday was a great day for The Witcher fans as CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took the stage</a> during the State of Unreal presentation in Orlando, Florida. The footage included a live demo of sorts, but a CD Projekt RED spokesperson <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/witcher-4-tech-demo-shows-the-game-running-at-60-fps-with-ray-tracing-on-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> to VideoGamesChronicle that it should not be confused with The Witcher 4 gameplay.</p>
<p><em>This is a tech demo, and a first look at the cutting-edge technology powering The Witcher 4 – but not The Witcher 4 itself. It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration with Epic Games to push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech, like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer, and FastGeo Streaming, that are helping shape the future of The Witcher.</em></p>
<p>This is perhaps unsurprising, given that the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that The Witcher 4 won't be released before 2027. As such, it's a little too early to see actual gameplay.</p>
<p>The Polish developer had <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its decision to switch from their proprietary RED Engine to Unreal Engine 5 back in 2022. Since the beginning, the claim was that CDPR would help improve the open world game development experience even for other developers. Indeed, what we saw yesterday was impressive, especially considering that the footage was captured on a base PlayStation 5 console that ran the demo at 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled.</p>
<p>On another note, some fans thought that Ciri looked a bit different in the new video compared to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous trailer that aired during The Game Awards 2024</a>. Again, a CDPR spokesperson addressed this feedback in a quote <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-ciri-trailer-gameplay-ue5-tech-demo-1851783467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided to Kotaku</a>:</p>
<p><em>It’s the same character model used in the 2024 trailer. Ciri’s face is a direct copy of The Witcher 3 model, adapted to work with the latest MetaHuman technology. Two subtle changes were made to improve animation quality: slightly raised eyebrows, and a more relaxed eye area—the latter was present in the trailer but has since been removed.</em></p>
<p>During the State of Unreal presentation, Epic Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the public availability of Unreal Engine 5.6, which brings several enhancements for developers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Back in 2023, several <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-ubisoft-executives-taken-into-custody-over-sexual-abuse-claims-according-to-reports">former Ubisoft executives were taken into custody</a> by French police, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-vow-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-harrassment-and-abuse">allegations of sexual harassment, workplace abuse, sexism and violence</a> in 2020. Now, some of those executives have appeared in court in Bobigny, Seine-Saint-Denis to defend their alleged role in cultivating a workplace where women were frequently assaulted or humiliated by senior members of staff.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The former Ubisoft executives in question are Serge Hascoët, former chief creative officer, who resigned after the 2020 allegations, and is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. According to his lawyer, he "denies any knowledge of reprehensible acts committed by collaborators at Ubisoft and did not receive any reports of this." Former vice-president of editorial and creative services Tommy François is also accused of sexual harassment, bullying and attempted sexual assault. He denies all charges. Former game director Guillaume Patrux, finally, is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. He, too, denies all charges.</p>
<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too">Guardian</a>, the court proceedings include more details about the allegations against the three executives, and what one Ubisoft staffer characterised as a "boys' club above the law". All the events in question were said to have taken place between 2012 and 2020.</p>
<p>Amongst other accusations, one woman was reportedly informed that wearing a coat with a red lining was "an invitation to rape", while another was told that her outfit had given somebody an erection. The most serious allegations include tying a female employee to a chair with a roll of tape and pushing her into an elevator. The same woman allegedly had her face drawn on with a marker pen and was forced to attend a meeting without washing it off. Some men are said to have been targeted, with one office game involving touching their genitals through their trousers.</p>
<p>There are also claims of religious hatred. A Muslim developer reports being ostracised after the 2015 jihadist Bataclan concert hall attacks in Paris. She also allegedly found bacon sandwiches placed on her desk or thrown at her during Ramadan. </p>
<p>During the court proceedings, a few of the individual alleged abuses were attributed to the three former Ubisoft executives on trial. Hascoët is said to have told staff that he should have sex with a colleague in a meeting room in front of everyone "to show how to calm her". François is accused of trying to kiss a woman on the mouth while his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back at an office Christmas party in 2015. François reportedly told the court this week that "I never tried to harm anyone" and that there had been a "culture of joking around."</p>
<p>As for Patrux, the allegations against him include miming physical attacks on staff, throwing equipment across an open plan office space, drawing swastikas on a woman's notebook during a meeting, and cracking a whip near colleagues' faces.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, Ubisoft apologised to "everyone affected" by the reported harassment and abuse, and announced plans to audit "our existing policies, processes, and systems to understand where these have broken down, and to ensure we can better prevent, detect, and punish inappropriate behaviour." In November 2021, current and former Ubisoft staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-employee-group-launch-petition-seeking-public-support-for-demands">launched a public petition</a> condemning the company for a lack of meaningful or transparent progress on this front.</p>
<p>In 2022, CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-ceo-defends-company-against-criticism-of-reforms-but-campaigners-demand-deeper-change/">responded</a> to criticism of Ubisoft's efforts to make amends by saying "we have done a lot and I think we are a company that can be proud of itself", pointing to the swift dismissal of certain reported offenders, including Patrux. Ubisoft have yet to respond to this week's revelations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-devs-tear-up-the-rulebook-let-the-bulwark-class-use-a-thunder-hammer-only-because-we-think-it-will-be-very-cool<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> have essentially said "it’s what the Emperor would have wanted" and made a big weapon change in the game not for balance reasons, but because it’s just really, really cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber Interactive released <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/221-pts-patch-notes-8-0-siege-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> for the Siege Update (Patch 8), which is available now on the Public Test Realm (PTS) for PC players, and in those confirmed it had extended the weapon arsenal in PvE to add the Thunder Hammer for the Bulwark class.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thunder Hammers are perfect for bonking the crap out of Tyranids and Chaos Marines with wide, swinging attacks that have great reach, but the weapon type is limited to the Assault class. The Bulwark class is also great, with its huge shield and overpowered, game-saving abilities. But up to this point the Bulwark was unable to wield a Thunder Hammer. It made sense that it couldn’t, given you need two hands to bring a Thunder Hammer to bear on a heretic’s noggin, and you can’t do that while holding a Storm Shield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a Bulkwark can equip a Thunder Hammer, but there is an understandable catch: if the Bulwark uses a Thunder Hammer, it can’t also use a Storm Shield. This significantly changes what the Bulwark is all about, which is being a Space Marine who hunkers down for proper last stand stuff. The class has various abilities tied to using the Storm Shield, such as Shield Bash, which when using a Thunder Hammer are no longer available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I love is the patch notes explanation from Saber Interactive justifying this change. It basically amounts to an admission that it doesn’t make a great deal of sense lore wise, but they’re doing it anyway for FUN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only one class can use the Thunder Hammer,” Saber explained. “We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, the Bulwark’s perks have been updated, which you can find detailed in the patch notes below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Siege Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there is a hugely exciting tease for expanded customization options coming to Space Marine 2, one that’s already got fans hyped for what’s to come in future patches. </p><blockquote>We are preparing a very big update for customisation, players will be able to reuse chapter champion armour parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping and technical restrictions). While it's not going to be in this patch, we wanted to mention this in this patch notes to assure you that we are going to continue expanding our customization system.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch notes do not reveal any new weapons or Operations mode maps, so it seems the focus here is squarely on Siege, which arrives in fully fleshed out form as part of Patch 8 on June 26. But Saber has confirmed new content is set to hit the game, including a new class. Season 4 also includes a new game mode for PvP and a new Chaos enemy.

When overwhelmed, players may call reinforcements for assistance. Engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring strategic adaptation. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing essential resources used to summon elite Space Marines or a formidable Dreadnought, drastically shifting battlefield dynamics.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Battlefield</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Survival Against Waves</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Face increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Side Objectives</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shop and Reinforcements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">1) Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2) Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">3) Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4) Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Boss Encounters</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every fifth wave introduces formidable boss battles, occasionally facing multiple elite foes simultaneously. Triumph in these encounters to progress to new fortress sectors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Infinite Waves</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your resolve endures through fifteen brutal waves, prepare for endless combat of increasing difficulty, reduced resources, and shorter preparation times. Even the Primarch of the Ultramarines understands that ultimate victory here is unlikely — but your bravery will echo through the halls of eternity."</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added option to<strong> disable bots spawn in Private Mode.</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Perfect if you’re looking for a challenge</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>RTAO</strong> experimental feature added — enables in in-game video settings</li><li><strong>DLSS 4</strong>  — better upscale for 50xx series cards.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Season Pass Content</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Added White Scars Chapter Champion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added White Scars Chapter Weapon Skin Pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added White Scars Chapter Customisation Pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added Blood Angels Customisation Pack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Extended Weapon arsenal in PvE </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added <strong>Thunder Hammer for Bulwark</strong>.

We think that Absolute difficulty wasn't that hard to begin with and now with a slight power creep of constant weapons buffs, perk buffs and prestige perks the situation is much worse.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>After doing multiple test we have scrapped the idea of having 2 Terminus enemies in Operations mode at the same time (except in Siege mode), because this meant that you would have to encounter them all of the time, otherwise one run with dual terminus spawns would be much harder than a run with 2 Terminus enemies spawning one by one. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Instead we've tried to make Terminus spawns harder and more intense.

            <p>Nintendo is currently in full swing gearing up for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and part of that has seen the company update a number of its original Switch games for the newer model. While many of these updates are along the lines of 'added support', Nintendo has gone a bit further with Legend of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> - there's finally a more streamlined way to find favourite Echoes no matter which console you play on.</p>
<p>Echoes, for those unfamiliar with the game already, are essential items (or creatures) Zelda can copy and paste into the world, and use to her advantage. For example, once Zelda learns a bed Echo, she can use imitations of this object to create a bridge. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-echoes-to-get-early-zelda-of-wisdom">Echo of the classic Legend of Zelda enemy the Peahat</a>, meanwhile, can be deployed during any confrontation and steadily use its spikes to jab your foes into oblivion. However, they could sometimes take a while to find during gameplay, given in total there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-echoes-locations-abilities-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-listed">127 Echoes to eventually choose from</a> all in one long list to scroll through. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo has heard our outcries (I am sure I am not the only one who has cried out...) about this. Now, those playing Echoes of Wisdom will find a new feature which displays "only favourited echoes in the list of echoes after 30 or more echoes have been learned". Huzzah! My word, I would have really loved this when I played the game on its release last year.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fallout-76/">Fallout 76</a> free update called Gone Fission is now live, introducing a slew of new features marking the beginning of Season 21.</p>
<p>The biggest feature introduced to the game by the Gone Fission update is fishing, which can be done in any water where swimming is possible. 30 new fish can now be caught, and it is also possible to cook new recipes using them. Before you can start enjoying this new pastime in the world of Fallout 76, however, you will first have to complete the Casting Off new questline, where you will receive a working Fishing Rod, which can also be upgraded by completing the new fishing challenges and daily fishing quests.</p>
<p>The Fallout 76: Gone Fission update also introduces 12 Axolotls to find, one available to catch every month throughout the year. The update also introduces Local Legends, new C.A.M.P. items related to the newly introduced fishing challenges, some combat changes, perk tweaks and rebalancing, and more. You can catch the full update notes <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2fsxzAz2icHeeJYGR37kQs/fallout-76-gone-fission-release-notes">here</a> and check out a quick overview of the new content introduced by the latest update in the trailer below.</p>

            <p>Get yer flip-flops out and dust last year's sand off the boogie board. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s world map will be bigger than previous games in the soaking survival series. At least that's what the developers say in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ">a recent Q &amp; A video</a>. They've also said they're returning to the storytelling style of the first game, with a silent protagonist and "player discovery" being the big driver of the story. </p>

<p>"The playable map size will be bigger than what we originally launched in early access on the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and even Below Zero's early access release," says creative producer Scott MacDonald in the video. "But just how big and how deep you'll be able to go over the course of early access, we're not exactly sure yet."</p>
<p>"The entire world is being handcrafted by a talented team of world designers and environment artists," he said, "and they're pouring everything into the world right now. We're aiming for this to be the biggest and most exciting Subnautica game ever once we hit 1.0 in a few years time."</p>
<p>It's not totally surprising for Unknown Worlds to go bigger for the sequel. But outright saying so may be reassuring to those players who complained that Below Zero's map felt smaller and shallower than the original survival splashabout. One player, for example, made comparison images to show <a href="https://imgur.com/xewdhVK">the difference in map size between games</a>.</p>

<p>I wasn't that bothered, to be honest. Much of the first game's map is open expanse and empty ocean - good for evoking a sense of vastness but not necessarily required in Below Zero's frosty ice fields.  The cold spinoff was still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-below-zero-review">beautiful and inviting</a>, even if all the bitter snowstorms raged in a tighter space. But hey, I get why people are endlessly hungry for more watery depths to explore. The original Subnautica remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. </p>
<p>The devs cover some other common queries. They say a lot of players want to go back to the environmental storytelling basics of the first game. So the game is "returning to having a silent protagonist", rather than a tailored protagonist as in Below Zero. "But that doesn't mean that we won't have the opportunity to showcase some amazing voice acting in PDA entries and in other areas," says MacDonald. </p>
<p>But not everything is returning to tradition. The vehicles you'll get here won't include the nippy Seamoth submersible or hulking Cyclops submarine from the first game, we're told, because the team want to make "new vehicles that are designed in the same spirit, just more suited to the brand new environment". Meanwhile full character customisation won't be available from the first moments of early access, they say, but it will get added later.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
