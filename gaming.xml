			<p>For fans of sports games and racing games, there are a few titles they can expect to see each year. EA and 2K will always give sports game fans and racing game fans something to play. But for 2026, thankfully there's a bit more to look forward to than just your regular annualized titles.</p>



<p>It's an especially good year for racing fans, who have the return of a major franchise to look forward to, and a new high-speed, sci-fi racer that could very well surprise everyone to be one of the best arcade racing games to come around in a while.</p>



<p>If the following games meet their expectations, you might see them again when we do our 'Best of 2026' picks at the end of the year. For now, these are the sports and racing games we're most anticipating in 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-dlc-expansion-of-2026/">DLC/Expansion</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Action Games</a></em></strong>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-2026-the-year-of-xbox-studios/"> <em><strong>Shooters</strong></em></a></p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Forza Horizon 6 (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forza-Horizon-6.png"></a><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 6. Image credit: Playground Games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 may not have been the surprise reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">Xbox wanted it to be at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">due to it leaking</a> about a month ahead of the show, but it was still exciting to see nonetheless. Forza Horizon 5 is arguably one of the biggest racing games released in the past decade, and its follow-up looks set to surpass its predecessor in every way.</p>



<p>We still don't know a lot about it, nor do we know when in 2026 it'll aim to be out, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">recent reports point to it being an early 2026 release</a>. Hopefully, those reports are correct, and we'll be able to head to Japan in Forza Horizon 6 sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-tennis-fever-february-12-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Tennis Fever (February 12, 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mario-Tennis-Fever.png"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Tennis Fever. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mario's line of sports games can be hit and miss (pun intended). Sometimes, they're excellently crafted and amazingly replayable, particularly with a few friends huddled around one TV. Super Mario Strikers on Nintendo Wii comes to mind when I think of some Mario sports games that were way more fun than they had any right to be.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Aces, the last game in the Mario Tennis series, does not fall in the same category as Strikers, but Mario Tennis Fever, the next game in the series <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">due out on February 12, 2026, on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, just might. At least we can hope it will, since Mario is due for a fun arcade-y sports game.</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Star Wars: Galactic Racer (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer.png"></a><figcaption><em>Star Wars Galactic Racer. Image credit: Fuse Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>'Now this is pod racing,' is what every Star Wars fan watching<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/"> The Game Awards 2025 said to themselves when we all collectively realized a new Star Wars racing game was coming our way</a>. At least it would have been, if there were vehicles in the trailer that actually looked like pod racers. </p>



<p>But even a bit of confusion over the lack of the death traps that Little Ani used to win himself out of slavery can't stop the excitement buzzing around the fact that Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a new racing game from Fuse Games, a studio formed by former Need for Speed and Burnout developers. It's frankly the kind of match-made-in-heaven that is equivalent to <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Star Wars: Galactic Racer is able to make a case for itself this year, and that when we talk about the best racing games of 2026 at the end of the year, Forza Horizon 6 has some company in the conversation.</p>



<h2 id="h-exo-rally-championship-tbc-2026-pc">Exo Rally Championship (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Exo-Rally-Fest.png"></a><figcaption><em>Exo Rally Championship. Image credit: Exbleative</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exo Rally Championship was one of our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">honourable mentions for our most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025</a>, and a year later, not only are we still looking forward to it, but we've moved it up to one of our main five picks for the year. It might not have the brand recognition of the other sci-fi racers on this list, but this off-road arcade racer from developer Exbleative and publisher Future Friends Games is absolutely worth keeping on your radar.</p>



<p>There's no definitive sign as to when it'll arrive, but hopefully last year's Steam Next Fest demo was an indication that the team is making enough progress that it'll be out before the end of 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-golf-with-your-friends-2-tbc-2026-pc">Golf With Your Friends 2 (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Golf-With-Your-Friends-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Radical Forge</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ending our main picks with something fairly different from the rest, Golf With Your Friends 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Golf With Your Friends, a chaotic multiplayer golf game that arrived all the way back in 2016. </p>



<p>In the last decade, Golf With Your Friends has steadily maintained its popularity in such a way that it's sequel could become one of the year's flash-in-the-pan multiplayer games that breaks through and rides the waves of content creators playing it with their friends on livestreams. It might not reach the heights of games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Peak</a>, but it certainly feels like it has that kind of potential. </p>


<div id="democracy-1512" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1512,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Most Anticipated Sports and Racing Games of 2026</strong></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Everything old is old again.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 was bursting with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2025">really cool new game releases</a>: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yōtei, Blue Prince, Donkey Kong Bananza, I could go on. And yet, it seems like the vast majority of players (at least in the US) spent most of their time playing the old hits on repeat, because the five most popular games on PlayStation last year were exactly the same as the year before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared on Bluesky today</a> the top five most-played games in the US on PlayStation for 2025:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">And for 2024:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPpjLV77yTs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They're the same picture</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layout is different (I guess) on Xbox, with Minecraft and Roblox flipped for 2025, and a slightly more complicated order for 2024: Call of Duty at No. 1, then Fortnite, Minecraft, GTA V, Roblox. But uh, <em>same five games</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a pretty damning indictment of the current state of the industry. As Piscatella said himself almost a year ago on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/lrPeLqcty4I" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, this is a fairly recent trend. As he explains, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in the video game audience, with huge numbers of people playing games who never had before. As a result, many of the major gaming markets effectively reached a cap on how many new players they can obtain in future years, because everyone was already there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, that capped audience is now playing a smaller number of games overall. Some of that is just because games are getting more expensive. More people are gravitating toward live service games they're already familiar with where they can spend smaller amounts of money for a fun experience on a platform they already own, rather than spend larger amounts of money to try new things on new platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But some of that is simply a natural consequence of the rise of live service. As Piscatella continues to explain, the way the market used to work is that players would buy one big new game, spend all their time on that, then move onto the next one. But people just aren't buying new games anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you take the top ten service games every month...on PlayStation and Xbox, seven out of every ten people that turn on their console will play at least one of those games every month, and in terms of total time they're taking, those ten games alone every month take up 40% of total playtime on the consoles." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella also shares that at the time, Circana expected 30% of people that play video games would not buy a video game in 2025 (the actual numbers for the full year haven't been released just yet). A further 18% would purchase a new game every six months or less frequently. Only 12% buy a game once a month, and 4% buy new games more often than that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So when we're talking about the developers and publishers who are being hurt the most, are the games that are really targeting this 16% of total players that are purchasing very frequently, while the vast majority of players are buying a game or two a year, and they're playing Fornite, Minecraft, and Roblox."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is that it's harder than ever for brand new games to break through, which has been a major part of the recent wave of layoffs, studio closures, project cancelations, and just general industry devasation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea">we've been reporting on</a> primarily in the US industry for the last couple of years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella concluded that Kinda Funny presentation with a sentence he's said to me many times, and continues to say: "The biggest competitor to any new video game is Fortnite."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circana is expected to release its full report on US video game sales in 2025 later this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Cast as Bawma, a charismatic pirate king with a mysterious edge, Kravitz's video game debut promises action, intrigue, and a dash of rockstar theatrics. I had the opportunity to speak with him about his role in the game, his decades-long love for the Bond films, and to try to glean a little bit more about his character’s role in this twist on a traditional Bond story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally announced as “Project 007” in 2020, IO Interactive has started to loosen the valve on information about its upcoming game starring the international man of mystery. While we still haven’t had a chance to go hands-on with the project, it looks promising. Blending Hitman-style stealth-action with the globetrotting cinematic shine and sense of humor you’d expect from any silver screen adventure starring your pick of the actors who’ve held a license to kill, it feels appropriate that its villains would be larger than life, just like in the novels and films. That all starts with a bit of blockbuster stunt casting.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/knt-bawma-screenshot-3840x2160-1767730028977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lenny Kravitz as Bawma in 007: First Light.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though he’s new to the series as an actor, Kravitz’s love for the James Bond movies as a fan goes back to his time lining up to see Roger Moore’s films in junior high and high school. “I used to line up on the first night it would be in the theater with a friend of mine,” the musician told me, making sure to pay lip service to his favorite leading men, Roger Moore and Sean Connery. “The theme songs were always amazing, too, always epic,” he told me, reminiscing on Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better from The Spy Who Loved Me before shouting out his favorites: Shirley Bassey’s iconic Goldfinger, Wings’ Live and Let Die, and Duran Duran’s A View To Kill.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king. But he insists that he’s not just playing himself or sending up his favorite campy villains of bygone Bond films. Instead, he looked inward, drawing on his own experiences for inspiration. “I’ve met some folks that are… similar to his character. I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City and there were guys who had [Bawma’s] vibe and were doing similar things in the islands.” The musician told me the hardest part of playing Bawma was finding that voice and personality. “It’s really all in the voice,” he assured me. “It took a moment, but eventually we found the sweet spot.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Kravitz isn’t just a prolific performer. He also brought some of his expertise as an icon in the fashion world to the character, even getting involved in giving notes to the art and design team, weighing in on Bawma’s costume as seen in his reveal trailer. From the cut of his jacket to the placement of tattoos and scars, the final design in the trailer was the result of deep collaboration between Kravitz and the IO Interactive team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During our conversation, Kravitz dropped a few hints that Bawma might not be an outright bad guy, though, painting him as more of a morally ambiguous antihero, rather than a straightforward villain. “He’s an interesting guy. We’re not quite sure how he’s going to turn.” IO Interactive CEO and 007 First Light Director Hakan Abrak told me, “We wanted more than just a one-sided villain, like we wanted to have some kind of charisma.” Abrak added that he’s not all-out evil, teasing, “He has more sides to him that could maybe turn out surprising in the story. You’ll need to wait to see that until the game comes out.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That depth played into IO’s casting for Bawma, Abrak told me. During early meetings, IOI realized they needed a performer who could captivate a crowd to fit the character they’d written. He told me, “The way Lenny moves, the way he draws sympathy and empathy kind of drags you in as a person” played a big role in pushing IO to choose the rockstar for this role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since these interviews, IO Interactive has announced that 007 First Light has been delayed from March 27, 2026, to May 27, 2026.

                <p>Balatro and Hollow Knight: Silksong "shouldn't exist," according to industry analyst Joost van Dreunen. He elaborated that, "They don't make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved." Their commercial viability is an undeniable fact. However, the scale of their success baffles industry conventional wisdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Van Drunen is professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and a strategic advisor for the community development agency ELO. In an interview with <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nobody-wants-ai-slop-joost-van-dreunen-on-the-future-of-ai-and-the-shifting-economics-of-the-games-industry" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">GameIndustry.biz</a>, van Dreunen discussed how the shifting macroeconomics of video games is creating space for smaller projects to become massive successes. He compares the shift to the way television challenged the Hollywood business model. Free-to-play games like Candy Crush compete with, and even undermine, big-budget blockbusters like GTA or Call of Duty. Yet, there are an increasing number of games that skirt outside either model, such as Silksong.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The lower-tech production values of some indie games may also be a big asset. Van Dreunen said, "I'm a big fan of the idea that low tech is a much more interesting design factor than high tech. I think, demonstrably, whenever new technology comes out, what studios tend to do is just increase the final product. They make it more complex, and therefore they negate the productivity gains." Perhaps Balatro and Silksong can be impressive with smaller budgets and development teams because they leverage the productivity shifts bigger studios would use to expand their efforts.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, whatever the exact reasons, van Dreunen claimed that it's obvious people want smaller, engaging games at the same price point as Balatro or Silksong. Van Dreunen said, "I think increasingly it's clear that what people want is a $20 Silksong game that's challenging, but it doesn't have to make my eyes bleed in order for me to want it."</p><p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-most-downloaded-app-store-games-of-2025-include-fortnite-minecraft-and-balatro/1100-6536838/">Balatro was one of the most downloaded App Store games in 2025</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Nuketown 2025 Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Season 1 Reloaded's Fallout collab</h2><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty has teased a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-crossing-over-with-fallout-tv-show-in-season-1-reloaded/1100-6537059/">crossover with Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show</a>, which seemingly includes operator skins for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. Call of Duty's big IP collaborations are also usually paired with in-game events for players to participate in. However, it's uncertain if these Fallout skins will be included in an event pass or as shop bundles for purchase. Notably, both Fallout and Call of Duty are owned by Microsoft. </p><h2 dir="ltr">Two new weapons</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630786-sturmwolf452.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630786" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630786-sturmwolf452.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630786"></a><figcaption>Sturmwolf 45</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630786-sturmwolf452.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The update adds the Hawker HX sniper rifle and the Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun as two new weapons players can unlock for free.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hawker HX is a renamed version of the popular Ballista sniper rifle from Black Ops 2. It's a bolt-action sniper with fast handling and mobility. The Sturmwolf 45 is a renamed variant of Call of Duty's popular UMP45. This is a full-auto submachine gun, and Activision describes it as being "highly-accurate and easy to use."</p><h2 dir="ltr">BO6 loadout equipment and scorestreaks</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 1 Reloaded will add plenty of loadout items from Black Ops 6. This equipment includes the Shock Charge, Impact grenade, Thermal grenade, and the Tactical Insertion field upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">Several Black Ops 6 scorestreaks are also included:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Archangel Launcher</li><li dir="ltr">Combat Bow</li><li dir="ltr">Death Machine</li><li dir="ltr">Dreadnought</li><li dir="ltr">Grim Reaper</li><li dir="ltr">SAM Turret</li><li dir="ltr">Strategic Bomber</li><li dir="ltr">War Machine</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">More multiplayer maps</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630793-yakeimap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630793" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630793-yakeimap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630793"></a><figcaption>Yakei map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630793-yakeimap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The midseason update adds three more maps into the rotation: Yakei, Meltdown, Fringe.</p><p dir="ltr">Yakei is a brand-new small map for 6v6 and 2v2 modes, and the setting takes place on the rooftops of a neon-lit Japanese city. Meltdown and Fringe return from past Black Ops games.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Zombies</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630795-bo7zombiess1astramalorum.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630795" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630795-bo7zombiess1astramalorum.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630795"></a><figcaption>Astra Malorum map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4630795-bo7zombiess1astramalorum.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Zarya Cosmodrome location from Ashes of the Damned becomes a Survival map. The season's new Astra Malorum map also gets the Directed mode, which will allow players to have assistance with completing its main story quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Endgame</h2><p dir="ltr">The update also includes new content for the game's Endgame campaign mode. There are two new world events confirmed. Activision has confirmed the Wraith Wing world event, which adds a powerful VTOL Guild aircraft for players to take down. The second event is still unknown, but the publisher teases it will "test players' skills."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision has teased a mystery for Warzone players in Season 1 Reloaded. The publisher vaguely revealed that anomalies would start appearing periodically throughout certain locations. The announcement doesn't specify a specific map, so it's unclear if these anomalies will appear on one map or across all three.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's midseason updates usually include new events, challenges, bug fixes, and weapon balancing across all modes.</p>

Hiding in Plain Sight</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Did you know that you may have already been aware of some design concepts and how they apply to game tools before you ever read this book? It all comes from a familiar source that has been right in front of you this whole time: games!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Competitive games where speed and accuracy are important – like real-time strategy and fighting – can help us understand many different user experience concepts that can be applied to tools. Let’s go through a few of these concepts, and you might be surprised to find that you know more than you think!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Real-time Strategy Games &amp; Chunking">Real-time Strategy Games &amp; Chunking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, let’s look at how knowing real-time strategy games could mean that you might already understand the concept of chunking</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn1" data-discover="true">[1]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BoxeR the Brood War Champion">BoxeR the Brood War Champion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the all-time greatest players of Starcraft: Brood War is BoxeR. Amongst the many skills of a professional Starcraft player is the ability to build exactly the right type and number of units to defend against an attack.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/danielle-riendeau-s-top-three-games-of-the-year-2025-wrap-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Danielle Riendeau's top 3 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starcraft – like many great RTS games – has a “rock paper scissors” design where each unit is strong against certain units and weak against others. What this means is that if BoxeR’s opponents attack using units that are the equivalent of scissors, BoxeR quickly defends with units that are the equivalent of rock, not paper.</span></p><p>Figure B.1: StarCraft © Blizzard Entertainment</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, imagine that BoxeR’s opponent is playing Zerg and they attack with a combination of Mutalisks and Zerglings. This composition is so common that it has a nickname: “Mutaling”. When BoxeR sees this, they immediately start building Siege Tanks and Marines, since they are very effective units against that composition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how is BoxeR able to do this so quickly? In large part, it is because of their ability to effectively use chunking.</span></p><p>Figure B.2: Photo by Nick Fewings on Unsplash</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Chess and chunking">Chess and chunking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the best demonstrations of chunking and games comes from a replication study</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn2" data-discover="true">[2]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> done by the psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn3" data-discover="true">[3]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In their study, they showed participants a series of cards, one at a time, each with a picture of a chess board with pieces in different positions. They would give the participants 30 seconds to study the card, and then take it away and ask them to place chess pieces on a real board from memory in the same positions as on the card they had just seen.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-bryant-francis-top-10-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bryant Francis' top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The skill level of the participants in the study ranged from novice players to grandmasters. For this reason, it might not surprise you to learn that, for certain cards, the grandmasters were much better than the novice players. However, you might not expect that for some other cards, the novices were equal to the grandmasters. How could that be possible?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reason is that the cards where the grandmasters did better than the novices were cards of real games with plausible chess positions (left side of Figure B.3), and the cards where they were equal to the novices were cards where the chess pieces were randomly placed (right side of Figure B.3).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Figure B.3: Representations of the cards used in the chess study.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the perspective of the grandmasters, the boards on the cards are not made up of individual pieces but “clusters” of pieces in positions that they have seen in countless games of chess (left side of Figure B.4). Over time, these are internalized as chunks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cards with randomly placed pieces, however, could have impossible scenarios, like two Kings side by side, or two white Bishops on the same color squares (right side of Figure B.4). These are things that a chess player would never see, and therefore could not have internalized as chunks.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/diego-arguello-s-top-10-games-of-the-year-2025-wrap-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Diego Arguello's top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p>Figure B.4: Common two-by-two "chunk" of pieces (left) and impossible or improbable chess positions (right).</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, instead of memorizing the positions of each piece individually, the grandmasters memorized a few chunks that they had already internalized by seeing them over and over. Meanwhile, the novice players who had not developed the same number and variety of chunks as the grandmasters had to remember the positions of most of the pieces individually.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, when the cards were made up of random chess positions, the grandmasters couldn’t use their chunks to help them memorize the cards. For this reason, they were just as good as the novices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now you can see how this applies to BoxeR: When they see the combination of Mutalisks and Zerglings, they don’t see the individual units but a chunk, and that allows them to react much more quickly and build exactly what they need to defend against it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Chunking the TRS">Chunking the TRS</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how can all these ideas be applied to tools design?</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn4" data-discover="true">[4]</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most common user interface patterns in level editors and 3d animation software is the Translate Rotate Scale control or TRS for short. It’s a three-by-three grid of numeric inputs that represent the X, Y, and Z values for translation (sometimes called position), rotation, and scale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is almost always seen in the same order: The first horizontal row of three numeric inputs represents the translate XYZ (the position of the object), the second row is for the three axes of rotation, and the third row is for scale (the size of the object).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As people use this kind of TRS control, they start to develop chunks to quickly interpret the numbers. For example, if the first row is three zeros, the second row is three zeros, and the third row is three ones, they know that the object is at the center of the world with no rotation and no scaling (see Figure B.5).</span></p><p>Figure B.5: Default values in the TRS controls for Unity and Maya, © Unity, © Autodesk</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, what happens if the TRS control is not in the same order or orientation? In Figure B.6, you can see that the editor in the game engine Stingray flips the orientation of the numeric inputs to be vertical instead of horizontal, and 3D DCC Softimage|XSI puts Scale first, then Rotation, then Position (Translation).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the disadvantages of doing this is that people cannot use the same chunks that they have learned from using another software. So, seeing a first row of three zeros, a second row of three zeros, and a third row of three ones would mean something completely different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, if someone is working back and forth with two different tools (one to create assets and another to place the assets in a level) and the TRS controls in each are different, it could lead to confusion as they switch back and forth.</span></p><p>Figure B.6: The TRS controls for Stingray and Softimage XSI © Autodesk</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lesson here is that it’s important to present data in a consistent order in all parts of a tool so people can chunk it from one part of the tool to the next. If the same data is presented differently in various parts of the tool, it will be harder for users to internalize chunks of information and use them to be more efficient.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, if you’re creating a tool that uses the same pattern as another software that the users are already familiar with (like the TRS control), use the same order and configuration so that they can take advantage of the chunks that they have already internalized.</span></p><p>Figure B.7: Photo by Jack Pierce on Unsplash</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Fighting Games &amp; Human Vision">Fighting Games &amp; Human Vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, let’s look at how knowing fighting games could mean that you already know a bit about how the eyes and the brain work together.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn5" data-discover="true">[5]</a></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Saccadic Masking">Saccadic Masking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand saccadic masking, we first need to understand saccades and fixations. A fixation is the spot where your eye is focusing, and a saccade is when your focus moves from one point to another (see Figure B.8).</span></p><p>Figure B.8: Saccades and fixations</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When our eye saccades, our brain temporarily blocks visual processing to perceive the world as stable and reduce motion blur. What this means is that we are blind for a fraction of a second, without even realizing it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the best studies to show the effects of saccadic masking was done by Tim Smith</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn6" data-discover="true">[6]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In the study, he showed participants an image while tracking their eyes using an eye-tracking device. When the device detected a saccade, elements of the image would change or disappear. The participants didn’t notice most of the changes, because they were effectively blind during those moments.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Foveal Versus Peripheral Vision">Foveal Versus Peripheral Vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Foveal vision is sometimes called “central vision”, the part of our vision in the middle that is the sharpest. Peripheral vision is everything else around the center. It is not as sharp as our foveal vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some measurements suggest that the resolution at the extreme edge of our peripheral vision is as low as three pixels per foot (it’s better at detecting color and movement, though). Our brain compensates by “filling in” some of the resolution, especially if it’s something we have seen before. This means that unless we’re staring straight at something, we don’t see it as clearly as we may think we do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how does all this relate to fighting games?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sako and the Sentry">Sako and the Sentry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sako is one of the best fighting game players who is mostly known for their skill in Street Fighter. They are so well known for their Evil Ryu that they even have a combo named after them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the early 2010s, the company Steelseries released a device called the Sentry Eye Tracker (Figure B.9) to bring eye-tracking to the gaming community. Its purpose was to help gamers see their eye movements so they could improve their performance. They teamed up with Sako to release a video of him playing Street Fighter while using the Sentry Eye Tracker.</span></p><p>Figure B.9: Sentry Eye Tracker by Steelseries. SteelSeries® is a registered trademark of SteelSeries ApS.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you watch the video</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn7" data-discover="true">[7]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you’ll notice that he fixates right in between both characters (left side of Figure B.10). This is one of the things that separates him from novice players, who tend to saccade and fixate back and forth between both characters (right side of Figure B.10).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By doing this, he uses his sharp foveal vision to keep both characters in focus at the same time which minimizes the number of saccades that he does. This means that when his opponent triggers a move, he’s less likely to miss the first few frames... and when it comes to fighting games, missing a few frames can mean the difference between winning and losing.</span></p><p>Figure B.10: Sako’s eye movement compared to a novice player © Capcom</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Sako has probably internalized chunks of different poses that both he and his opponent are in, allowing him to read the situation and react ever more quickly (see Figure B.11). Another good example of chunking!</span></p><p>Figure B.11: Chunking poses from Street Fighter © Capcom</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Label Placement Eye-tracking">Label Placement Eye-tracking</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The blog UX Matters has done a series of studies in which eye trackers were used to understand what people look at in various user interfaces. One interesting study</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftn8" data-discover="true">[8]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> compared three different options for placing a label in a form: left-aligned, right-aligned, and top-aligned. Here is what they found.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Labels that were top-aligned and right-aligned resulted in the lowest number of saccades (left side and middle of Figure B.12), meaning that the users were much more efficient at interpreting the data in the user interface. However, left-aligned labels had almost double the number of saccades, meaning that users were moving their eyes around the interface much more than they needed to (right side of Figure B.12).</span></p><p>Figure B.12: Eye-tracking for right-aligned, top-aligned, and left-aligned labels</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how can we apply all of this to tool design?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Forms are very similar to a user interface element found in many of our tools: property editors. They are usually made of a label associated with an input (often a text input, but it can be other types as well).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, labels in the Maya Attribute Editor are right-aligned, allowing the user to fixate in the center and read both the label and the value without having to saccade back and forth (left side of Figure B.13). Compare this to Stingray, where the left-aligned labels require the user to saccade back and forth to read the label and the value (right side of Figure B.13).</span></p><p>Figure B.13: Right-aligned labels in Maya versus left-aligned labels in Stingray, © Autodesk</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This problem gets even worse when you resize the property editor horizontally, meaning that the labels move even further away from the inputs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, although top-aligned labels performed as well as right-aligned labels, using them for property editors can be problematic because they usually require the user to scroll due to the increased use of vertical space. They should only be used in situations where there are a small number of inputs. Property editors usually have a very large number of inputs, and so for this reason, right-aligned labels are a better choice.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wrapping Up">Wrapping Up</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now, you can see how certain types of games can not only help us learn tools design concepts, but they can also be to explain those concepts to others as well!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keep in mind, however, that some games purposefully increase friction (see excise in the Design chapter) as a part of the gameplay. While this may be fun in a game, it is not fun when you’re trying to get your work done, so it’s best to look for examples from competitive games where speed and accuracy are important.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So now you know about another great resource that you can use to learn tools design concepts, one that has been hiding in plain sight all this time: games!</span></p><p>Figure B.14: Photo by Hadyn Cutler on Unsplash</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref1" data-discover="true">[1]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We will learn more about chunking in Chapter 5!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref2" data-discover="true">[2]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The original chess study came from Adriaan de Groot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref3" data-discover="true">[3]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> You might know them from their study on selective attention, also known as the invisible gorilla video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref4" data-discover="true">[4]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In Chapter 5, we’ll see an example of how chunking can be used to interpret hexadecimal color values.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref5" data-discover="true">[5]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We will learn more about human vision at the start of Chatper 5.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref6" data-discover="true">[6]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Here is a video of the study: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIF3FRwbG6Y&amp;ab_channel=edz44</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref7" data-discover="true">[7]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> See the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmAwAefKZ8o</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools#_ftnref8" data-discover="true">[8]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Here’s a link to the blog post for the study: https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-the-user-experience-of-game-development-tools]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Splitgate developer 1047 Games has reacted to the online commentary regarding the recent re-launch of the shooter Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. The game arrived in mid-December 2025 and hasn't gotten close to the Steam numbers that Splitgate 2 or Splitgate 1 reached, prompting online commenters to wonder if the game will be able to stay online.</p><p>The developer <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>, "Steam charts don't measure fun," adding that Steam player numbers only show "one number, on one platform, at one given moment." Steam numbers do no show the "full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming."</p><p>1047 Games re-launched Splitgate 2 under the name Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, and Steam numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spiked to about 2,300 concurrents at launch.</a> In the past 24 hours, the game reached a peak of 952 players on Steam.</p><p>For comparison, Splitgate 2 had its most-ever players (25,785 concurrents) in early June <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-battle-royale-mode-out-now-alongside-splitgate-2-official-release/1100-6532195/" data-ref-id="1100-6532195">when the game's battle royale mode arrived.</a> The original Splitgate, meanwhile, achieved a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/677620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">record of 67,724 peak concurrent players</a> back in August 2021.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_kqmh6hXiM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_kqmh6hXiM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>1047 Games is encouraging people to give Spligate: Arena Reloaded a shot. "The gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion," the studio said.</p><p>The game will get a big new mode in the future in the form of Arena Royale, which is a battle royale mode.</p><p>Steam's player data is public, but the same cannot be said for PlayStation and Xbox, so we do not know how Arena Reloaded is performing on consoles. The game was always likely to face an uphill battle for marketshare, as data shows people may try new games but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-top-5-most-played-games-on-playstation-and-xbox-are-the-same-as-2024s/1100-6537207/" data-ref-id="1100-6537207">end up sticking with their established favorites. </a></p><p>It's been a bumpy road for Splitgate in the past year. One of the bosses at 1047 Games wore a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Make FPS Great Again" hat</a> at Summer Game Fest in 2025, which led to some controversy. Additionally, there were complaints about microtransaction prices. The studio would later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/" data-ref-id="1100-6532622">lay off staff, while its founders stopped drawing a salary</a>. Splitgate 2 took the unusual move of reverting back to beta in July 2025 before the re-launch in December.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Baldur's Gate 3 Cast Answers Our Burning Questions</p>
      </div>
<p>Stranger Things co-creator Matt Duffer mentioned to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that he was playing the Larian Studios-developed title while working on the final season. Duffer implied that the climactic showdown with Vecna and the Mind Flayer shared themes and elements with both D&amp;D and Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p>According to Duffer, the show's entire cast of characters found "self-acceptance" through the story and ended up "absolutely primed" going into the final battle.</p><p>"They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right?" Duffer said. "And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable."</p><p>One of the biggest strengths of Baldur's Gate 3 was its memorable party members, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-astarion-has-almost-as-much-spoken-dialogue-as-the-narrator/1100-6536824/" data-ref-id="1100-6536824" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-astarion-has-almost-as-much-spoken-dialogue-as-the-narrator/1100-6536824/">such as Astarion</a> and Shadowheart, all of whom go through their own compelling story arcs. Similarly, the characters of Stranger Things overcame obstacles and developed significantly through the show's five seasons.</p><p>The fateful battle against the show's two main villains is set in an environment referred to as The Abyss, a desert wasteland in an alternate dimension. The "party" of characters travels there through the Upside Down to confront Vecna and the Mind Flayer, taking the latter down through a coordinated attack involving firearms, Molotov cocktails, a flare gun, and other means of brute force.</p><p>Of course, Stranger Things and Baldur's Gate 3 have some more explicit overlaps. As some of the characters in the show are avid D&amp;D players, they often name the creatures and villains they encounter after D&amp;D characters, such as Demogorgons, and of course, Vecna and the Mind Flayer. Baldur's Gate 3 heavily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/" data-ref-id="1100-6516428" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/">features mind flayers in its story</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, Duffer mentioned that "lots of video game references were applied to that final battle," though he doesn't elaborate on these references. One explicit reference early in the season was a somewhat inaccurate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-things-made-a-mistake-with-an-old-school-game-or-did-it/1100-6536658/" data-ref-id="1100-6536658" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-things-made-a-mistake-with-an-old-school-game-or-did-it/1100-6536658/">scene featuring Ghost 'n Goblins</a>.</p>

            <guid>1398829</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Having forgotten all about it (it was first announced years ago!), some news coming out of CES this week reminded me that Sony and Honda have teamed up on a new electric vehicle that, for the purposes of this blog, has some PlayStation stuff in it. And the news very quickly reminded me of why I'd forgotten all about the car in the first place.</p><p>The electric vehicle market is a cut-throat space; the emergence of a bunch of Chinese brands in recent years, the difficulties many established manufacturers have had switching their cars from combustion engines to electric motors and a hostile political climate have all worked together to create the most tumultuous auto market in decades.</p><p>In 2026 you can't just put out an electric car and expect people to buy it; you need to give them very good reasons to consider your offering ahead of the multitude of fantastic options already out there, particularly from Chinese and European labels. Which is why Sony and Honda's big CES <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9jRMrRoCmM&amp;themeRefresh=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>press conference</u></a>, showing off the production model of their Afeela joint venture (now called the Afeela 1), was so disappointing.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykl_GmJDB1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="AFEELA | CES2026 Sony Honda Mobility Press Conference"></iframe></figure><p>Actually, disappointing might be the wrong word, because that would imply I had any kind of expectations for this vehicle in the first place. But it looked blergh when I first saw it in <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2023-01-04/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2023</u></a>, and it still looks blergh now in 2026, only now it has a ton of better and cheaper cars to compete with.</p><p>What makes it blergh? Let's start with the styling! Which is subjective, I know, but I don't think it's a huge stretch to say the Afeela looks bland, or to point out it looks like<a href="https://lucidmotors.com/air?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Lucid made a cheap, taxi version of the Air</u></a>. Because EVs don't have huge engines at the front, and because they're supposed to be from the future, many companies have got <em>wild</em> with their styling (look at Kia and Hyundai), whereas the Afeela just looks like a...car.</p><p>Moving on to more objective faults, let's look at the Afeela's numbers. Now I know, numbers with a car aren't <em>everything</em>, but with an EV they kinda <em>are</em>, because an electric vehicle's range and charge speed are much more important figures for your daily experience than, say, a combustion engine's economy. To check out the specs for the Afeela 1, you can visit the car's <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>website</u></a>, select to build your own order and be met with, uh:</p><blockquote>Sensors: 40 UNITS</blockquote><blockquote>Computing Power: 800 TOPS</blockquote><blockquote>Tesla Supercharging Network​: 25,000+</blockquote><blockquote>AFEELA Intelligent Drive (Level 2+ ADAS)</blockquote><blockquote>AFEELA Personal Agent</blockquote><blockquote>Media Bar (External Information Display)</blockquote><blockquote>Immersive 3D Map</blockquote><blockquote>Immersive Entertainment Selection</blockquote><blockquote>Customizable Theme</blockquote><blockquote>Spatial Sound System</blockquote><blockquote>5G Connectivity</blockquote><p>That's nearly all stuff that every EV (actually, nearly every car) on the market just <em>has</em>, and is so basic and taken-for-granted that nobody even bothers looking up the specifics. Teslas have had self-driving for years, most EVs let you change their "theme" to some extent and almost every modern car rolling off a factory floor has some kind of voice assistant. A car's specs page should be where the important stuff goes, and with an EV that's its range, its battery size, its speed, its <em>charging </em>speed (as in, how long it would take you to charge from 10-80% on the road), its trunk size and maybe some other stuff like whether it has any V2L or V2G capability (meaning your car's battery can power appliances with the former and your whole house with the latter).</p><p>With the Afeela 1 you've gotta go digging to find most of that, which is never a good sign. And yup, you've gotta dig for a reason: most of the Afeela's specs are very, very bad by 2026 standards when you consider that this car is going to cost over <em>$90,000</em>. Some examples: it'll do "up to" 300 miles on a charge, which means it will actually do less in the real world, in a market where Teslas and Polestars are now routinely doing over 400 miles (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOjPP4LZvWE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>or over <em>500 </em>in a Polestar 3 if you drive as carefully as possible</u></a>). Its maximum charge rate at a public fast-charger is 150kw; the Kia EV6 could do almost double that back in 2021. And its acceleration speed--again, not a huge deal, but something buyers do absolutely consider--hasn't even been announced yet, implying that either the pre-production model on stage at CES was <em>very </em>pre-production, or that it's going to be <em>slow</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>The two rear screens in the Afeela 1 are the most logical place to be using the PlayStation connectivity (L), while the car's yoke steering wheel (R) won't be to many people's liking</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>So does it have <em>anything</em> going for it? I dunno, it depends on how much you like the idea of <a href="https://wapo.st/4ssr7Ff?ref=aftermath.site"><u>playing PlayStation games in your car</u></a>, something the Afeela 1 will do via a Remote Play app for the car's infotainment system and rear screens. It also depends on how much you like the idea of a yoke steering wheel. Oh, and if you live in California or not, because that's the <em>only </em>state in the US from which you can order one of these cars at the moment.</p><p>But man, I look at this car and I see almost nothing that sets it out from the pack. The Afeela afeelas boring, in the same way so many other electric vehicles from established manufacturers--<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/709240/japan-evs-critical-materials/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese ones especially</u></a>--do, where companies lacking either the commitment or the experience to really lean into the segment end up making cars that provide no reason to hate them, but none to love or buy them either.</p><p>I just don't see who this car is for. For under $90k in the US you can get a <em>premium</em> EV like a Porsche Macan, Audi S6 Sportback e-tron, Polestar 4, Lucid Air or BMW i4 (or i5), all of which crush the Afeela in terms of specs and inclusions (not to mention prestige). Even if it were $30k cheaper it would <em>still</em> struggle against cars like the Tesla Model Y and Kia EV5.</p><p>It's such a dated, forgettable vehicle that about the only time I ever see anyone talking about the Afeela is when, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonys-upcoming-afeela-1-car-will-let-you-drive-with-astro-bot-or-god-of-war/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">like this week</a>, the PlayStation stuff is mentioned. To which my counter would be: if you're looking to throw $90k at an electric car, you can get a much better one than this for that money, and have enough left over to toss a Steam Deck or PlayStation Portal in the back seat while you're at it.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/random-speedrunner-becomes-first-person-to-complete-super-meat-boy-deathless</link>
            <guid>1398811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a>'s reputation precedes it. The notoriously-difficult precision platformer is designed to be extremely challenging, and death on every single screen is basically inevitable. Amazingly, it's taken over 15 years for anyone to fully complete the game — that's get 106% completion — without dying, but it <em>finally</em> happened at the end of last year (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-taken-15-years-but-someones-finally-completed-super-meat-boy-without-dying-once">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Back in December, Nintendo speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7bnhmqT3s">shredberg</a> became the first person ever to fully complete Super Meat Boy deathless. Yes, seriously, no one has been able to do this since the game was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010. The platformer came to Switch in 2018.</p>
<p>"I've been doing this way too long" shredberg says laughing after his record-breaking win. "I'm not saying that I wasn't nervous, because I was very nervous at the end there, but I was way more nervous just in Dark Cotton... Once I got past Dark Hell 2, I was relatively fine."</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be emailing everyone — Kotaku, IGN, CNN, Chef's Illustrated. They're all going to hear about it."</p>
<p>You can watch the full two hour stream up-top, but if you've even played a few minutes of Super Meat Boy, you know how tough this game can be. shredberg, somehow, makes this look effortless.</p>
<p>Even one of the game's co-creators, Edmund McMillen, congratulated shredberg on social media with a simple "Congrats!"</p>

<p>Sharing his achievement on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Supermeatboy/comments/1pnjrqr/i_got_106_without_dying/">Supermeatboy subreddit</a>, shredberg thinks it took him "like 700-800 hours of grinding" to reach this goal, which is staggering.</p>
<p>He's been streaming much of his progress over on Twitch over the years, in-between other speedruns for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's next? Some followers on the archived stream have made some suggestions for shredberg, such as playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or other games. Whatever it is, we hope shredberg has fun. Congrats on the record!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Steam's Winter Sale is now over, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most">the latest report from Alinea Analytics,</a> PC players are going to be spending their time playing ARC Raiders while they wait for the next store-wide sale for the platform this Spring.</p>



<p>December 2025 was the best December for Steam yet, with the platform generating<strong> over $1.6 billion</strong> last month. It was a <strong>22.7% increase</strong> compared to December 2024, and it handily beat December 2020's COVID-era numbers when Steam brought in a gross revenue of $1.4 billion.</p>



<p>As for what drove that record-breaking gross revenue? ARC Raiders, the third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios that continues to be the 'game of the hour' after its massive launch in October 2025, was a big part of that success. Since it hit the market, it has barely slowed down, just recently having reached over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/">12 million copies sold</a></strong> overall. On Steam alone, Alinea estimates it has sold over <strong>7 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the holidays, ARC Raiders was the second-best-selling game on Steam by revenue. It sold over 250K copies on Boxing Day, and its concurrent player counts show no sign of the game leaving the top-played games on Steam anytime soon. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">it has yet to fall below 250K concurrent players on Steam since it launched</a>. </p>



<p>As for which game took the number one spot in terms of revenue, that went to Counter-Strike, which is what you'd expect from the game that constantly remains the most played game on the platform.</p>

<p>The charts for Steam's December 2025 get more interesting when you look at copies sold, as they directly point out the value of a good deal. Detroit: Become Human was 90% off during the Winter Sale, making it less than the price of a latte at Starbucks. At that price, approximately <strong>993K</strong> players who hadn't bought it before took their chance, and it was the second-best-selling game, behind ARC Raiders, for December 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Battlefield 6, which was 30% off during the Winter Sale, and Slay the Spire, which was also at an all-time low at 90% off during the Winter Sale. Good timing for developer Mega Crit, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">getting prepared to launch Slay the Spire II later this year, in March 2026</a>. </p>



<p>When ARC Raiders arrived in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto gave it a 9/10 in his review,</a> writing, "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

The release of Lorwyn Eclipsed will contain new cards for fans to enjoy, new prebuilt decks, and some sly marketing courtesy of the Jim Henson Workshop.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Announcements</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-lorwyn-eclipsed" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast showcased the card and products included in the <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> set. Like most major set releases, it will contain Play Boosters, Collector Boosters, Draft boxes, and Prerelease boxes. The set will also include several prebuilt decks. These include two 60-card theme decks designed for Standard format, and two 100-card Commander decks.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The post showcases the artwork on the new cards. As the name suggests, this new set returns to the land of Lorwyn, a place separated by day and night by the twilight god Isilu. As such, shock land cards like Blood Crypts and Steam Vents will be reversible with Day and Night versions. In addition, certain Legendary Creatures and Planeswalker cards transform, such as Oko and Eridu. further representing the dichotomy.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This comparison to fairytale worlds is made more overt by some coy marketing on Wizard's part. In addition to a debut trailer, the studio released a three-minute promo video, titled <em>The Ballad of Squen and Cragg</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCQ5EF69rSQ" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on YouTube</a>. The video is a musical number centered on two characters, Squen from the sunny Lorwyn, and Cragg from the dark Shadowmoor, all brought to life through Jim Henson Muppets.</p><p>Additional posts confirm that Lorwyn Eclipsed will include borderless and art variants of certain cards. The big draw is a serialized, double rainbow foil, borderless version of Bitterbloom Bearer, brought to life by artist Rebecca Guay. Only 500 copies will be printed, so happy hunting.&nbsp;</p><picture>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From cackling goblins to crackling spells, the world of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and other trading card games has no shortage of iconic imagery and artwork shot throughout its history. For the off-the-wall art collective known as Puke (yes, Puke... for real!), the magical worlds of TCG's have served as their inspiration, as they bring their wild creations to life via playmats, stickers, and other TCG accessories. I got the chance to sit down with the Puke gang to talk gross out humor, design aesthetic, and the importance of hand-made art in the world of <em>MTG</em>.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/puke-a-duel.jpeg?itok=HbET0Gbo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1374" height="800">

  </picture><p>To start, I wanted to know... just what in the world is Puke? "Puke is two dudes," says Stefhan Alvarado, one half of the two dudes. "I’m Stefhan and, like my partner in crime Josh, I'm an Illustrator. Puke is everything the both of us creatively agree on rolled up into one neat little brand." To which Josh Lees, the other half of Puke, adds, "Yeah to piggyback on this nerd's back, we're trying to bring something new and fresh to the community that isn’t defined by boundaries, and speaks to every purveyor of the wacky, weird, and outsider swag."</p><p>They're bringing the new and fresh something via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a Kickstarter called Puke! Presents: A Barf Bonanza</a>. "Aside from just making cool merchandise and getting it out to the public," says Alvarado, "the Kickstarter’s main goal is to kick off Puke as a brand. Get the word out on the streets." With vibrant, colorful illustrations, the group seems to me to be kicking down the doors of what's established and expected in the tabletop art world, letting their unhinged creative juices flow.</p><blockquote><p>You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending.</p></blockquote><p>Friends and collaborators since their art school days, both Alvarado and Lees have extremely distinct and unique visual styles. I wanted to know how they go about infusing those styles into one cohesive brand. "Our styles are very interesting to me," Alvarado explains.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have almost the same exact influences when it comes to our art but somehow what we each produce almost feels like polar opposites. Art is funny in that way. You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"I think Stefhan nailed this on the head," says Lees, "It’s kind of dope to see how our styles meld together and how we work as a team. I think art style-wise, we both have a great respect for the other's craft, not to be too sappy. But we also aren’t afraid to tell each other if we have a different opinion."</p><p>"If I were to describe both of us in a different light," Alvarado continues, "I’d say that I lean more towards a traditional illustrator and Josh leans more into the fine artist territory. Those roles are all very shallow though, you learn pretty quickly as a working artist that you are a sum of your parts, and most of the time for illustrators that means that you have to be good at a lot of different things. In the end you end up being a Designer, Animator, draftsmen, illustrator, visual story teller, sequential artist, painter, etc."</p><p>For Alvarado, the coolest part of their collaboration is "that we’re both each other’s number one fans. We’re both competitive, but in a very healthy way. We push each other to keep upping the ante with our art. The product in the end speaks for itself it’s always the coolest it can be at that moment."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Since I'm here sitting down with two real-deal artists, I wanted to get their thoughts on the future of art and the increasing presence of AI. "With AI being forced down everybody’s throat," says Lees, "I think people want something that’s more human. As companies go full tilt into that landscape, they fail to understand that, for the viewer, AI art does nothing! Maybe it makes you mad or makes you laugh for a second, and then what? It's just slop."</p><blockquote><p>I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human.</p></blockquote><p>Alvarado agrees, "I think there's no better time than now to take creative risks with your art. I think it needs to feel tactile, gritty and imperfect, “punk” in a way. I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human. You’re basically collecting art and playing with it. You’re showing your individuality through the games by showing off your interests."</p><p>Lees continues, "While this is a terrible thing being implemented into our society, I do think that there will be a sort of Dada era of the arts where people make creative that rebells against the slop-apocalypse. That being said I do think that there is some really great music and art coming out these days; most likely being fueled by the times that we live in. Artists thrive in chaos and hard times."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Puke channels all of this frustration and inspiration into a concept they call "Art First." I asked them to explain this concept a bit more. "We keep hammering this Art First mantra down each other’s ear-holes because it makes everything simple. It keeps the brand from getting muddy. We keep pushing each other to make the dopest art we can make."</p><p>Lees adds to this sentiment, "It’s always been art, it’s always gonna be art, and it’s never <em>not</em> art. We want to strive to put out work that has an undeniable quality to it - and that goes from the quality of the playmats, stickers, and sleeves we're producing, to the image itself. We aren’t afraid to tell each other, 'hey that looks baddddd,' which keeps us honest and always makes us push it as far as we can go. Easy way to think of it is: Indiana Jones. We are Indiana Jones, and art Is our holy grail."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>As we wind down our conversation, I wanted to hear about their favorite <em>Magic</em> cards. "I think that aesthetically and mechanically," Alvarado says, "<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/82/dark-ritual" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Dark Ritual</a> is my favorite card. It represents its color so well and in the simplest way possible. Pay a little to get more. It feels like the spell a dark necromancer or warlock would use to summon a demon. Real Metal."</p><p>For Lees, his love of the game, and his favorite color and card, all started when he was a kid. "I started playing magic in the Time Spiral block," Lees explains, "when my childhood best friend gave me the gift of <em>Magic</em>." He and his buddy each bought a horrible pre-constructed deck during that block, "You people don’t know how nice you have it these days" Lees laughs.</p><p>"But from that, I was sorted into the house of Blue: the best color ever. Funny enough this leads into my fav magic card every which would be Mark Poole's <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/65/counterspell" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Counterspell</a>." The artwork, which depicts a mage with his spell fizzling as it leaves his fingertips, is described by Lees as, "just goated with the sauce, dripping with swag, sick, beautiful and wonderful all at the same time. Plus the best magic card mechanically ever created."</p><p>With that, our conversation comes to a close. Full of art, ambition, and clear-eyed intentions on what they want to create, there's a lot to love about Puke!</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">To learn more about Puke and their outrageous Kickstarter, head over to the crowdfunding page!</a></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, MTV is a zombie network that primarily <a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">airs episodes of </a><em><a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">Ridiculousness</a>&nbsp;</em>and random Paramount-owned comedy films. It’s depressing. But before all that, before <em>The Real World</em> and <em>Road Rules</em>, MTV was a channel that mostly played music videos, and it was cool. So I was happy to hear that someone has created a free MTV simulator website, complete with retro ads.</p> <p>MTV Rewind is a website that tries to recreate the experience of watching the original music channel back in the day. When you first visit the site, it starts playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_music_videos_aired_on_MTV">original MTV broadcast</a>, complete with VJ introductions and the original music videos that were aired on that faithful day back in August 1981. I wasn’t alive back then, but it’s still fun to relive that launch from the comfort of my PC in 2025.</p>

  <p>Beyond recreating the first day, MTV Rewind features different decades you can swap between, built up of playlists featuring thousands of videos, as well as random, old TV ads from back in the day. And I have to admit, there is something special and comforting about returning to an era in which music was delivered to me without me having to create playlists, seek out artists, or hear the stuff that some algorithm decides I want to listen to next. Just a hose of old music videos streamed directly into my ears. Cool shit.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/1q5e7n1/comment/nxzbdgn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">The creator of MTV Rewind says</a> they built this project, which uses YouTube for all the videos, over the course of a week as a “passion project.” They shared on Reddit that they have “a deep nostalgia” for MTV and miss the 24/7 music videos. I’m happy they took the time to make this site. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lot of 1990s music to jam out to while I work.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-developers-hit-back-criticism-steam-charts/</link>
            <guid>1398790</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate 2, which was recently rebranded as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, has been having a fairly tough time of late. The game was relaunched after being pulled back to beta following a hampered and relatively disastrous summer release, but the second wind has failed to generate much traction.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Splitgate developers at 1047 Games addressed the ongoing discourse around the game’s lack of success, which typically relies on Steam player numbers to frame a picture of the game’s struggles.</p>



<p>The developers are saying, as many have before, that Steam’s player numbers aren’t indicative of the bigger picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-rely-on-steam-to-get-your-consensus">Don’t Rely on Steam to Get Your Consensus</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media damning the discourse around Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s inability to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generate any hype</a> the second time around, <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the team said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Steam Charts don’t measure fun.</p>



<p>They show one number, one one platform, at one given moment. They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</p>



<p>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible.</p>



<p>To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p>



<p>And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For reference, here’s what the Steam Charts look like for Splitgate: Arena Reloaded at the time of writing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This statement comes months after Splitgate 2’s sentiments plummeted around a miserable launch and a marketing campaign that fell flat in a pretty spectacular way. There were concerns about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">microtransactions</a> and bold statements made by the 1047 leadership team, and on two occasions, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were made</a> that further damaged the company’s PR image.</p>



<p>Even the game’s paid influencer campaign came under fire, with one analyst labelling the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">effort ‘tone deaf’</a> and stressing that it ‘alienated its core audience in pursuit of mainstream appeal.’</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a potential hit, zombie indie game, then you might want to start preparing yourself for the Quarantine Zone: The Last Check release date. By preparing yourself, this means ensuring you’re free of zombie bites.</p>



<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check infuses the infectious (no pun intended) eye for detail of Papers, Please, and the typical survivalist qualities of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indie</a> survival horror rolled into one. One second, you’re scanning survivors for the slightest sign of a bite, the next, you’re desperately defending yourself from a horde of undead.</p>



<p>If you’re currently free of quarantine right now (even if you’re not, no one will tell), check out the game’s launch day.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-coming-out">When Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We see through you, literally. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check has an official January 12 release date exclusively on PC systems.</strong></p>



<p>Closed playtests have come and gone, which means it’s time for the full launch. Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is one of the most-hyped Steam games in January, and with the month not bubbling in terms of AAA releases, it could be time for an indie game to get the huge boost it deserves.</p>



<p>Its game mechanics and fundamentals seem safe and secure, so unless there are any late breaches, you can look forward to a post-Christmas plague party to pile hours into.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-have-a-demo">Does Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Have A Demo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A caged animal. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is a free-to-play Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo that you can download and play right now on Steam.</strong></p>



<p>It’s always safer to try before you buy. Thankfully, Brigada Games and Devolver Digital are more than happy to oblige, courtesy of The Last Check’s free Steam demo.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick explainer on how to acquire it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Steam</a> page.</li>



<li>Scroll down until you see a big, green box saying <strong>Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Demo</strong>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Download</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose <strong>Install</strong>.</li>



<li>As long as you have the 21 GB required, it should download and install itself on the system.</li>



<li>Once ready, you can try out the free Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo!</li>
</ol>



<p>Again, there’s a lot of interest in The Last Check, but it doesn’t hurt to have one ‘last check’ to see if it’s for you or not.</p>



<p>You’ve still got time to read about Quarantine Zone: The Last Check or play the demo.

                <p>Mistborn fans may be able to take to the virtual streets of Luthadel eventually, but not for a while. As part of the yearly "State of the Sanderson" <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025#video-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, author Brandon Sanderson shared that he has been in conversations with multiple AAA developers about a potential Mistborn project. If the project does come to fruition, it will be years away.</p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson seems to be optimistic about the project's chances. He wrote, "I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. ... This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging One." Though he doesn't name any names, he does claim that he has been chatting with big players in the industry, including ones he is a fan of himself. Sanderson is also seeking maintain his rights to video game adaptations of Mistborn.</p><p dir="ltr">It appears that these discussions are in the earliest possible stage. "These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last... oh, six-seven years," Sanderson wrote, "so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently." Sanderson concluded that any studio or publisher interested in developing a Mistborn or Stormlight project should get in touch with his representatives.</p><p dir="ltr">Mistborn is one part of Brandon Sanderson's sprawling Cosmere setting, which also encompasses the Stormlight Archive series. Multiple tabletop games based on Sanderson's work have emerged in recent years, including <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-rpgs-based-on-brandon-sandersons-novels-are-cheap-right-now/1100-6523355/">Cosmere tabletop RPGs</a> and <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mistborn-saga-deckbuilding-game-brandon-sanderson/1100-6532518/">a Mistborn deckbuilder.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson himself has some professional experience related to video games. He designed the world and created characters for <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moonbreaker-is-a-brandon-sanderson-video-game-universe-designed-to-last/1100-6508189/">the tactics game Moonbreaker</a>. Should this project release, it would not be Mistborn's first foray into video games. A project called "Mistborn: Birthright" was in development for a few years before being canceled. Protagonist Kelsier was a guest character in Fortnite, owing to Sanderson's long-standing relationship with Epic.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Things Are a Bit Established at the Top” – The Top-5 Played Games in the US in 2025 on PS and Xbox Were the Same as 2024’s]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/</link>
            <guid>1398742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you think the problem with video games these days is that everyone plays the same five games all the time, which makes publishers more wary of taking risks, and instead of getting new, creative and innovative games, we get more of the same, then <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> just gave you some fuel for that argument, as the numbers for the top-five played games in 2025 on PlayStation and on Xbox were the same as the top-five games played on both platforms in 2024.</p>



<p>They're even almost in the exact same order, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">Piscatella reports on Bluesky</a>, with the top five played games in the US on PlayStation, as ranked by percentage of active players, are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Roblox</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>
</ol>



<p>On Xbox, the list is:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>All five games are on the list for the most-played games on either platform in 2024, with the PlayStation 2024 list not changing at all, and the only difference on the Xbox 2024 list being that Call of Duty and Fortnite swap places, as do Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto V. But it's still the same five games, seemingly consuming everyone's time on consoles in the United States.</p>







<p>Piscatella followed the news up by saying, "<em>Things are a bit...established...at the top</em>." He also claimed that a more detailed report, including the top-selling games in 2025 in the US, overall and by platform, will arrive on January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>Any new game's biggest competitor is Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, and Roblox. Those are <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">the five games that are dominating the industry,</a> and the reason why new games have a tough time gaining any traction.</p>



<p>Those are also five free-to-play games (Call of Duty: Warzone), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">as Piscatella has reported before,</a> US consumers are likely to spend less on video games as tariffs and the rising cost of living continue to impact their discretionary spending. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">2025 might've been the year of indies</a> controlling the conversation and the awards, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong, Blue Prince, etc, but those are not the games that keep the industry moving. </p>



<p>So if you're the person complaining that we keep getting the same kinds of games over and over again, or that publishers aren't greenlighting new titles for fear that they'll get swallowed up by 'the big five,' then vote with your wallet where you can, and maybe spend a little more time <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">in the 'indies' section of Steam</a> instead of on Fortnite. It won't be much, but at an individual level, it's one of the best things you can do.</p>

              <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><em>Stranger Things</em> season five finale</a> ends with a big fight involving the major players of the series, and according to the creators behind the hit Netflix show, how this large fight played out was inspired by <em>Baldur’s Gate 3.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Last week, on New Year’s Eve,<em> Stranger Things</em> wrapped up after nearly a decade with an epic two-hour finale. While some fans weren’t happy with the conclusion and are <a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704">even theorizing that a special bonus episode will be released soon,</a> the last episode of<em> Stranger Things</em> did deliver a big battle featuring Vecna, the Mind Flayer, and many of the characters people have grown to love over the last few years.</p> <p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/">In a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a>, the Duffer brothers, the duo behind the show and its finale, revealed that the big boss fight was inspired by playing<em> Baldur’s Gate 3.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“We were thinking about <em>D&amp;D,</em> and I was playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> [while creating the finale], and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together,” said Matt Duffer. “Everyone had fully realized—either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues—moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> and something like <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">Swen Vincke,</a> the head of the studio behind<em> Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> seemed pleased with this information, <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2008573846526529945">resharing it on Twitter</a> and saying, “That’s pretty cool.”</p> <p>While speaking to <em>Variety</em>, Matt Duffer also added that “lots of video game references were applied to that final battle,” but didn’t confirm anything specific. Also, it sounds like the Duffers are aware of your wild theories that the “true” finale is yet to be revealed and simply replied, “Obviously, that’s not a real thing.”</p>

                <p>Prolific video game voice actor Troy Baker said he believes the generative AI revolution is a "good thing," in that it will push people to seek out "authentic" experiences made by artists as opposed to AI "gruel."</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Baker said there is no doubt "AI can make content way better than humans" and can "crank it out no problem." It is important to remember, however, that what AI makes is merely content, not art, Baker said.</p><p dir="ltr">"AI can create content but it cannot create art," Baker said. "And the reason why is because that invariably requires the human experience.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it's that it requires artists. People go, 'Look what AI can do.' It's like, 'Yeah, okay. I see what it's capable of doing. It doesn't matter.' And we don't need to diminish it, we don't need to denigrate it, we don't need to demonize it. We need to just go, 'okay, it's there.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Baker said from a business perspective, AI is threatening, but that AI may actually be beneficial to artists in the long run.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I see happening is that this birth of AI, and this burgeoning industry of it, is actually going to drive people to the authentic," Baker said. "And we're going to see opportunities of, 'I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.' 'I want to see theater.' 'I want to read books.' 'I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror.' I think that it's a good thing. It's a revolution."</p><p dir="ltr">AI use in game production, and AI voices, has become a hot-button issue in recent years, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">SAG-AFTRA video game actors strike</a> that ended last year revolving around actor protections in regards to AI. Despite vocal pushback from some players, certain developers have continued to move forward using AI to help create their games. Embark Studios, the developer behind last year's extraction-shooter-hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, uses <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">AI to generate NPC voices</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, actors like Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine have signed deals allowing for their vocies to be used by AI. Despite James Earl Jones dying in 2024, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI version of the Darth Vader voice actor's voice appeared in Fortnite</a> last year, where it quickly generated headlines due to players tricking the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">AI into saying the F word and racial slurs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Baker, who is a member of SAG-AFTRA, recently received acclaim for his portrayal of Indiana Jones in MachineGames' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. Indiana Jones actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-praises-troy-baker-and-the-lack-of-ai-for-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/1100-6529281/" data-ref-id="1100-6529281">Harrison Ford himself praised Baker's performance</a> and said "[Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p>

Hopefully, you have the RAM to run it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the specs revealed today are only for 1080p/30 FPS (minimum hardware requirements) and 1080p/60 FPS (recommended hardware requirements), so there's no word on what kind of PC you'll need to play the game at, say, 1440p or 4K or even an FPS rate higher than 60. Nonetheless, you can find the requirements below:&nbsp;</p>

<figure data-uuid="91e9d815c552e"><a title="eShop Selects December 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91e9d815c552e/eshop-selects-december-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello and welcome to 2026 <em>and</em> the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a> of the year. You made it! Congrats!</p>
<p>Of course, we start the year off by looking at the last month of 2025, December. And boy, what a December we had — probably one of the most-stacked we've ever had, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>'s release and a bunch of surprise Nintendo Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>Of course, that means the eShop has been pretty busy, with some genuine surprises sneaking in before the Holiday season. So we've voted for the best of the best of the digital-only selection. The reles, as always: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from December 2025 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067imqonx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Alrighty then, let's have a look at the very best of December's eShop releases.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:195306,181925 @ 1767735394 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We don't think anyone was expecting the amount of game releases we got in December 2025. Usually, the end of the year is a little quieter, but we were kept rather busy in the run up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Of course, there are two bigger games we haven't had the chance to review yet — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> dropped on Christmas Day in the US, and we're working on covering that very soon. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, which (now-former) Nintendo Lifer Felix <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">ranks among his favourite games of the year</a>, also slipped through the cracks of a busy festive period.</p>
<p>That leaves us with a total of eight games that scored an 8//10 or above that are eShop exclusives (at the time of writing this). Here's the five that didn't quite make the top in a closely-fought battle of votes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> (NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> (NS1, NS2) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">9/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">3rd Place - Marvel Cosmic Invasion (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Trust Tribute Games to give us a near-perfect Marvel beat 'em up in the same vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>. And that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> is — not only a love letter to Marvel's rich comic book history, but a beautiful and excellent arcade side-scroller.</p>
<p>The roster is surprisingly robust and varied here, with every character feeling extremely distinct. And with the tag-team mechanic, you can play through the game multiple times with your favourite pairings and change things up as many times as you want. Add in the unlockable hard mode, and you have your new favourite co-op experience with a friend.</p>
<p>Available on both Switch 1 and 2 — and fantastic on both platforms — we scored the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">an 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Sonic Racing CrossWorlds -(Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Surprise! Speeding onto Switch 2 at the end of the 2025, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is <em>finally</em> fully realised on the newer console. Yes, it is getting a full physical later in 2026, but right now, this is a digital-only purchase or upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for this port, too, as CrossWorlds really struggled on the older hardware. Here, it's beautifully smooth with sharper resolutions and 60fps in both docked and handheld mode; all the other excellent bells and whistles are in tact, meaning this excellent racer can stand alongside Mario Kart World as one of the system's best, at least in the early days.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds scored an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10 from us</a>, and there's more free content and DLC to come in the future.</p>

</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">1st Place - despelote (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>One of 2025's very best games released on other platforms earlier in 2025 — <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/nobodys-really-heard-of-it-but-this-is-one-of-my-xbox-games-of-the-year-for-2025">Pure Xbox</a> is among the outlets celebrating it — and it <em>just</em> managed to squeak its way onto Switch in December. And thank goodness, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> is a special one, and it barely beat out Sonic to win December's eShop Selects.</p>
<p>This short, sweet game follows Julián as he reflects on the time Ecuador qualified for the 2002 World Cup. This is not a soccer game, though — it's a beautiful narrative tale about Julián's experience growing up amidst this fervour. It's largely flown under the radar, but those who have played it have raved about it. And we're joining the chorus.</p>
<p>despelote scored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/despelote">a well-deserved 9/10 from us</a> and takes the final eShop Selects trophy of 2025.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-december-2025]]></content:encoded>

And now, following complaints from some in the</span><i><span> Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> community who found escaping too difficult, developer Battlestate Games has decided to make things even harder.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As part of the long-awaited 1.0.0.2 update on December 1st of last year, Battlestate Games added four unique endings to </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> gruelling 200-ish hour-long campaign. </span><span>Battling through the chaotic wave of AI-controlled enemies is no simple task, especially since you’ve just been stripped of all your gear, </span><span>but things become all the more punishing once you reach Terminal’s final hurdle. And according to </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/terminal-ending-change"><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>, after some players said they found it too challenging, the devs decided that it actually still sounded a bit too easy.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’ve yet to complete Terminal for yourself, be warned that we’re about to get into heavy spoiler territory here.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>When </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> full release update dropped, it added a brutal decision that players had to make: a boat had to be taken to reach the titular escape, but it only fit three. The game’s standard player formation is squads of five. Thus, two people had to stay behind, becoming engulfed in a nuclear blast while others sail away to safety (and earning themselves one of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> “bad” endings).</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Naturally, considering all the work it takes to get to that point, a sizable chunk of the community complained online. </span><a href="https://x.com/Velion/status/2007488455002206273"><span>This included</span></a> <i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> streamer Velion, who wrote, “</span><span>I would really like to see this changed where everyone can escape together. Imagine being able to go into terminal and meeting 2 other players who you work together on a hard map and you survive and make it out.” </span><span>Directing his feedback squarely at Battlestate Games, he tagged studio head Nikita Buyanov in his Twitter post.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Buyanov immediately replied by simply stating “its changed already,” which would reasonably lead you to assume that leaving Tarkov with all your buddies is now an option.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Turns out that Buyanov considers himself a comedian, as he actually meant that things have “changed” for the worse. As </span><a href="https://x.com/Pestily/status/2008264876163228137?s=20"><span>other players</span></a><span> online have already pointed out, the number of players who can now escape at the end of Terminal has been whittled down to one.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Of course, you could just play through Terminal by yourself and not have to bother with the hassle of deciding which of you gets to live once it ends, but that feels like it defeats the point. </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> has always been a game about forging bonds and making friends, and watching them all get consumed by a nuclear blast while you sail off into the sunset, </span><i><span>Titanic-</span></i><span>style, just seems fitting.</span></p>
