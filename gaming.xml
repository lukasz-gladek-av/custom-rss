        </p>Game Creator<figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>Founder of “Shirosawa Games.” His debut title was a major hit, earning him the reputation of a “genius creator,” but his later works failed to replicate that success.</p><p>He has two younger sisters; the youngest, Ruri, was one of the six girls who vanished in Akihabara 13 years ago in an unsolved case known as the “Akiba Disappearance.”</p><p>Struggling with stagnation in his daily life, he declares that he will make a comeback by creating a game based on the very incident that took his sister away. Its title: <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“Not only am I becoming a character in a game this time, but working alongside IzanagiGames and professionals from the gaming industry itself has been a real challenge for me. I’m truly delighted that what we’ve created together as a team can cross borders and reach people all over the world.</p><p>“Also, by facing this project together with such talented cast members from various fields, I feel the game has gained depth and even sparked a kind of chemistry. It’s an unknown challenge, but as I imagine people around the world picking up and enjoying this game, I know I’ll want to grab a controller myself.”</p><p><strong>◆ Aoi Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura)<br>Maid</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>The younger sister of Shinjo, she works as the manager of a maid cafe in Akihabara.</p><p>Since the disappearance of the youngest sibling, Ruri, she has often clashed with her brother, who immersed himself in game development, and they have barely seen each other over the past 13 years. After graduating high school, she has continued to live in Akihabara, the site of the incident.</p><p>While usually somewhat aloof, she occasionally reveals a tsundere side that captivates many of her customers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m Sayuri Matsumura, and I play the maid in <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>“I’m thrilled that my long-time dream of becoming a ‘resident of the 2D world’ in the anime and game universe I love has finally come true. From Akihabara, we’re bringing the culture that Japan is proud of to the world.</p><p>“We did a lot of shooting. A LOT.</p><p>“The unique filming method used for games was completely new to me, and it revealed connections and hidden hints in the story that you can’t fully grasp from the script alone. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone enjoy discovering them while playing.</p><p>“Each cast member has a carefully crafted story, which is truly impressive.</p><p>“I hope everyone dives deep into the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>!”</p><p><strong>◆ Yukimi Kurahashi</strong> (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe)<br>Game Streamer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>Working as a designer at “Shirosawa Games,” she is also a popular game streamer, having gained a following through his streaming, which began out of his love for games.</p><p>A huge fan of Shinjo’s debut work, White Crash, he moved to Tokyo and boldly joined Shirosawa Games. He looks up to Shinjo and co-founder Takasawa like older brothers.</p><p>His occasional Tohoku accent that slips out during streams adds to his charm and draws in viewers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“It was such an honor to play a character in a game for the first time! In dramas and films, audiences usually enjoy witnessing our characters’ lives, but in this game, becoming the protagonist and ‘choosing’ the story yourself is such a fresh experience.</p><p>“There are cinematic scenes, but many are depicted in still images, so for me—someone used to acting in full-motion video—the challenge was to convey a real, lifelike sense of presence so players can truly enjoy the game.</p><p>“In life, we make many ‘choices’—big decisions as well as small, everyday ones. I hope players enjoy the world they encounter when they experience these choices through the story.”</p><p><strong>◆ Moe Kurosu</strong> (portrayed by Misato Ugaki)<br>Gourmet Writer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A gourmet writer specializing in Akihabara, known for exploring the district through its food.</p><p>Originally a generalist writer, she became fascinated with Akihabara’s subculture about three years ago and now introduces everything from long-established restaurants to the latest trend cafes and unique eateries with her own unique perspective. While her casual outfits are accessorized to match her style, her tough, tomboyish personality is reflected in her rugged car.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I grew up playing games like <em>Puyo Puyo</em>, <em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a></em>, <em>Zelda</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> without even realizing it, and I take pride in everything I’ve learned from them. That’s why it’s such an honor to actually be part of a game myself.</p><p>“My character, Moe Kurosu, is outwardly a playful, big-eating older sister, but she is also a tough, strong-willed adult woman. Portraying this duality was a challenge on set.</p><p>“While I was initially unsure about the unique filming style used for games, I had so much fun collaborating with the staff to bring the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em> to life. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we enjoyed creating it!”</p><p><strong>◆ Kokone Nagato</strong> (portayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48)<br>Underground Idol</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>An underground idol active mainly in small live houses in Akihabara. She belongs to the group “Baby☆Macaron.” While exuding the full charm of a classic idol, her ambition to succeed is unmatched. She switches clearly between on- and off-stage life, often wearing high-end brand clothes and accessories outside of performances.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m truly honored to be part of this project, which crosses the boundaries of games and television!</p><p>“<a title="Series > Persona [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lly, I’ve always felt the importance of embracing new challenges as the times change, so I’m excited and thrilled to be able to explore a new area of entertainment as a performer.</p><p>“With that in mind, the cast and staff worked together wholeheartedly during filming.</p><p>“I hope everyone can experience this fresh, unique form of entertainment through the game.”</p><p><strong>◆ Chihiro Jimbo</strong> (portrayed by Azusa Ohara)<br>Shrine Maiden</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_022.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A shrine maiden working part-time at Kanda Myojin, the guardian deity of Akihabara.</p><p>After an event in her childhood, she came to believe in the existence of gods and developed a deep gratitude for the city of Akihabara. She is also an avid gamer and easily clears even difficult <a title="Genres > Action [3,043 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>. Calm and gentle, her catchphrase is “Kami desu…” (“It’s divine…”).</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m Azusa Ohara, playing Chihiro Jimbo.</p><p>“As someone who has always loved watching game streams, I was genuinely thrilled when I was offered this role.</p><p>“I never imagined that I, who had always been a viewer, would become part of the game myself. It was a new challenge for both me and the staff, and I remember spending many days experimenting on set.</p><p>“I feel truly honored to be part of this project and I’m excited to see how it will reach everyone. I hope many people will enjoy it!”</p><p><strong>◆ Wakana Yusa</strong> (portrayed by MINA of East Of Eden)<br>Cosplayer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_026.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A cosplayer based in Akihabara. She has dedicated over ten years to cosplaying Ririka from the legendary game Magical <a title="Companies > Elementa [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happy-elements/elementa">Elementa</a>ry Student Ririka, fully embodying her love for the character. As a returnee from overseas, she is fluent in English and interacts easily with foreign tourists. Her cheerful personality and excellent communication skills keep her going full speed along the “Ririka cosplay path.”</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m so happy to be part of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>, which is full of new ideas and challenges!</p><p>“I usually perform as a bassist or in a band, so this was my first time appearing in a game—a completely new challenge.</p><p>“Everything was new to me: acting, reading the schedule, and even the terminology. I learned every day from the cast and staff.</p><p>“But the filming was incredibly fun, and I’m glad I jumped in.</p><p>“As a bassist, I never imagined I’d have such a wonderful opportunity to take on a new challenge—what a surprise!

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was a smashing hit when it landed as one of the Nintendo Switch 2's earliest major exclusives, so it makes perfect sense that Nintendo would capitalize on its success with some DLC. The DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC provides nostalgic fans with a small but charming new island to explore and a whole new mode to work through that changes up the gameplay loop from the base game.</p><p>If you're looking to dive into Donkey Kong Bananza's DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC, here's how to get started.</p><h2>How to start the DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC in Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><p>Before you can begin the DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC in Donkey Kong Bananza, you'll need to purchase it from the eShop for $20. Once you've made sure that it's installed, you can then open the game to get started. But be aware that how you access the DLC and how much of it is available to you is based on your game progress.</p><p><strong>If you've beaten the game and rolled credits</strong>, load back into your save and speak with one of the Elders (any of them will do) to learn about the rehearsals, Donkey Kong Bananza's primary endgame activity. At any point after this, you can visit any warp gong in the game to have the eel tell you about DK Island and open up fast travel there. This layer will now always be listed at the very top of the layer list.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569231" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569231"></a><figcaption>The DK Island layer is always listed at the top of the layer list once it's unlocked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg"></figure><p><strong>If you haven't beaten the game</strong>, you can speak to Squawks in the Racing Layer to open access to DK Island. However, you will only be able to explore the island at this point, as the Emerald Rush mode can only be unlocked after beating the game. </p><p>Once you arrive on DK Island, you'll find that there aren't any Banandium Gems to find. Instead, this island is designed to offer a dose of nostalgia for long-time fans and act as a hub of sorts. There are some secrets hidden around--and you can trade Banandium Chips with Squawks to earn some neat collectible statues based on various Donkey Kong characters and enemies--but the main thing to do here is speak with Void Kong and begin your journey through the Emerald Rush mode.</p><p>For more on Donkey Kong Bananza, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/donkey-kong-bananza-all-glamtone-fashion-test-solutions/2900-6782/" data-ref-id="2900-6782">All Glamstone Fashion Test Solutions</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-all-quiztone-quiz-answers/1100-6533307/" data-ref-id="1100-6533307">All Quiztone Quiz Answers</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 this October, and if you weren't already sold, Bandai Namco has now released a demo.</p>
<p>This "free demo" is available to download on the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms. It will give you a sample of the upcoming entry in the puzzle-platformer horror series, as you step into the Necropolis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Step into the Necropolis, the #LittleNightmares III demo is out now on all platforms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This demo release follows Bandai's news in June, confirming a Switch 2 "Enhanced Edition" for the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a>, which will also be made available next month. This version of the first game will run at 60FPS, includes higher resolution, faster loading times, and also comes with quality-of-life improvements.</p>

                <p>After what felt like a couple of centuries in the making, EA has finally revived its classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-2007/" data-ref-id="5000-28378">Skate</a> franchise with a new, free-to-play entry in the series. It's an early-access title right now, so it's fairly barebones in terms of its presentation, and the live-service aspect has sparked quite a bit of, ah, <em>discussion </em>among longtime fans of the series. But there is one thing that folks seem to be in agreement on with the new Skate: They nailed the feel of skating just like the original games did.</p><p>Out of the box, however, it may not feel exactly the way you remember. But there's a pretty easy solution to that problem in the game's settings, where certain "assists" are activated by default that make skating a much more forgiving experience. In addition to those must-tweak settings, we have some recommendations for other options related to custom ramps that most players will want to consider, and and audio option related to the game's narrator that could make your experience just a little less irritating in the long run. Let's take a look.</p><h2>Best settings to make new Skate make feel like the old Skate</h2><p>Navigate into the settings menu, then choose Gameplay, and then tab over to the Assists menu. For the true, old-school Skate experience, turn everything in the difficulty options section down. I did, however, allow myself to keep Allow Fall Height at 1, the middle option, for the sake of sick jumps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569303" data-ratio="0.56257242178447" data-width="1726" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569303"></a><figcaption>For the truly unforgiving old Skate experience, turn all these options all the way to the left.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png"></figure><p>But wait, there's more! Below that you'll also find On-Board Helpers, and it's the same story here as it is above: turn them off. But if you'd like to ease yourself into it, you can leave on Prevent Low Air Spins, which makes it a little easier to maintain control at high speeds by preventing you from turning yourself when you're bouncing slightly. But eventually you'll want to turn that one off too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569305" data-ratio="0.56278366111952" data-width="1983" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569305"></a><figcaption>These On-Board Helpers can make your skating time easier if that's what you're into.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png"></figure><p>There's also an Off-Board Helpers section at the bottom of this menu, but you can do whatever with those since those settings make it easier to get around on foot. You can do far more on foot in this game, like climbing up the sides of buildings, than you could in the old ones, so we endorse anything that makes that go faster so we can get back to skating.</p><p>Congrats, you've turned the new Skate into the same sort of painful and unforgiving experience that the old games were. But there are a couple other very important settings you'll also want to know about before too long.</p><h2>Turn off other people's quick-drop ramps</h2><p>The new Skate brings back and improves upon one of Skate 3's best features: the ability to place ramps and other objects anywhere you want in the world with a couple of button presses. The downside of this, however, is that this new Skate is an always-online game in which the world is constantly filled with other players, and they can also place ramps wherever they want, too. Knowing our fellow gamers the way we do, it's not hard to imagine a number of different scenarios in which folks might be really irritating with their ramp powers.</p><p>Fortunately, this problem can be wrangled quickly in a way that you probably didn't even know existed since you can't access it from the normal settings menu. To find it, you'll need to pull up the quick drop menu by pressing right on the d-pad, and then press the Options/Start button to open the quick drop settings menu. Scroll to the Multiplayer section at the bottom. Here you can govern whether you'll be subject to ramps placed by other players--and, crucially, you can make it so other players can't mess with the ramps that you place.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569306" data-ratio="0.56281725888325" data-width="1576" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569306"></a><figcaption>Free yourself from the tyranny of random people's ramps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png"></figure><p>Once you're done with that, there's still one more setting you may want to keep in mind, particularly in the early goings.</p><h2>How to turn off the narrator</h2><p>Throughout your time in Skate, a nice digital lady called Vee runs you through the tutorials and missions as you learn the game and progress through, similar to the cameraman role that Giovanni Reda played in the original three games. Unfortunately, Vee is not as much fun to listen to as Reda was, and she really talks way, way more than she should, often repeating the same message over and over every time you return to your session marker, which is maddening. Fortunately, you can disable her idle chatter completely by turning off Gameplay Vee Comments in the <strong>Audio settings</strong> menu.</p>

<p>Zombie hunter Juliet is back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>More Switch titles are slowly beginning to receive Switch 2 game upgrades, and Dragami Games has now announced its own plans for Juliet's zombie hack-and-slash <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lollipop_chainsaw_repop">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>.</p>
<p>The title will be getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition featuring "high frame rate", "high resolution", and it will be made available as an upgrade for existing Switch owners. It's scheduled to arrive at some point in November 2025. It hasn't been revealed just yet if this will be a free or paid upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<p>When this title arrived on the Switch last September, one of the main issues with the title was the performance and optimisation, so the Switch 2 version will hopefully sort these problems out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An idiosyncratic collaboration between Suda 51 and filmmaker James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw highlights the unique style of both creators. It’s a hyper-stylised, quip-heavy action game that remains a uniquely demented experience. Sadly, content omissions and some choppy performance hamper this remaster, tainting the colourful mayhem."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/no-im-not-human-review-underlow</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-im-not-a-human-review-underlow.1299885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a certain detachment that arises from staring death in the face. Watching a car lose control, the occupant fumbling with the brakes as they attempt to contend with a 2-tonne slab of metal designed for ease of travel, aiming directly for your fleshy vessel. The only thing stopping it? A lamppost made of the same material as a Nissan wraps around it, a reminder of how easy it is to lose time to sleep; an anecdote that repeatedly sprang to mind while living through <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em>.</p>

<p>This is the debut commercial title from Eastern European developers Trioskaz: A psychological horror concept which has been making sheer waves since its initial release as a part of the <em>Violent Horror Stories</em> anthology in 2024. A year later, with some bigger and bolder tweaks to the story progression, as well as a publisher pick-up in the form of Critical Reflex, <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em> is set to comfort you in these prying times.</p>

<p>You play as a self-imposed hermit, one who has been closed off from a lot of the outside world, and in some ways, much to their chagrin. This all changes when the sun explodes, bringing with it deathly heatwaves, cataclysmic global suffering, and entities rising from the ground calling themselves “Visitors”. Posing as human beings with history, personality, and opinions, they and others will seek refuge in the form of your home, with you having to choose who to let in, while dealing with the end of the world, together or by yourself.</p>



<p>At night, the door will pound incessantly, a testament to the wood's strength that it doesn’t just fall off the hinges. Look through the peephole, and you’ll see people begging for shelter, explaining why they’re there, and who to look out for. Through the harsh night-vision filter, it’s hard to discern who’s a Visitor or not, so you have to make the judgment call then and there. Saying no cannot be the option every time.</p>

<p>In the daytime, the heat is too harsh to venture outside, so you make yourself comfortable with your new tenants. Find out how they feel, watch TV, and find out that the new agency FEMA has found “sure-fire” ways to spot Visitors. Bloodshot eyes and dirty fingernails could be your monsters in disguise, or they could be a sign of lack of sleep and poor hygiene. It’s up to you to decide whether they stay or go out with a bang, your trusty shotgun proving to be the judge, jury, and executioner.</p>

<p>It’s mechanically sound, and despite a different path being executed, it’s feasible to draw a lot of comparisons to the stressful management of games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/this-war-of-mine" rel="nofollow"><em>This War of Mine</em></a> or <em>Impact Winter</em>. You are responsible for lives here, and while most will disappear into the night, it’s who you let in and what they bring in with them that can haunt you. Your new best friend for the end of the world could have his time cut short because of your mistakes, and that brings with it new scrutiny.</p>



<p>Indeed, the list of comparisons could stretch for miles if you really searched for it, in what is one of <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em>’s more egregious misgivings. From <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/whats-deal-with-analog-horror-games" rel="nofollow">The Mandela Catalogue</a> to Hauntology, the game will give a sly little reference here or there, which, within its bite-sized framing of characterization, feels off-putting in exactly how much it could be original. I mean, they literally rip a line from <em>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</em>, and tie it to a central storyline.</p>

<p>It sounds nitpicky, and that is correct, but it’s the kind of execution that can make the player second-guess themselves, and think about how much of the game isn’t paying its own dues. With that in mind, <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em> would have to work pretty bloody hard to carve out its own essence – not only that, but do it with such nuance that its potential to be accused of cribbing is immediately dwindled.</p>

<p>Not only do Trioskaz work wonders to evade such criticisms, but they do it with a passion and fire that makes&nbsp;<em>No, I’m Not a Human</em> an unbelievably horrific narrative to dissect in microcosms. Make no mistake, this isn’t a horror game, but a <strong><em>horror </em></strong>game, a sick little insight into the complete disintegration of a supposedly restrained people. Rules may be what separate us from animals, but the clock plays more than just a bit part.</p>



<p>A lot of the weight comes from the visual design. It’s easy to look at the surreal and crude compositions of the flavorful cast you’ll meet and assume they bring with them jokes and screenshot-worthy out-of-context lines. Take time to read what they’re saying, however, and find that nearly each line is packed with so much emotion, misery, and splendor that it’s hard to say no.</p>

<p>The encounters are randomized, so your mileage may vary in how much zaniness you come across with each playthrough, but of the 4 playthroughs I trawled through, each one had at least one gut-punch. That one character who wasn’t laughing wasn’t painted with a joke in mind, but was human, and therein lies the key. It seems obvious, but the charisma of sympathy that <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em>&nbsp;showcases, even when it’s looking to rip your throat out, is, frankly, miraculous.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack in its writing, which is why this review might feel so scanty. Structurally speaking, a lot of the teething problems from <em>Violent Horror Stories</em> are still here, like missing story beats regarding religion and general politicism. It definitely feels like <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em> wants to grab a loudspeaker and make their case for those subjects, but it’s suffocated by what’s already present and prescient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is present is a legitimate amount of effort put into the management aspect, in spite of its light-footedness. Of the 4 playthroughs, 2 of them were experiments, in which I played the yes man and the dissident, respectively. Both playthroughs ended with severe punishments in mind, so it’s nice to see Trioskaz isn’t allowing an autopilot sense of mind to infect how you interact with <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em>.</p>

<p>Another issue is that this game is sad. Really sad, like, an unfathomably heartbreaking experience that makes Critical Reflex’s other darling <em>Mouthwashing </em>look like an SNL skit, which is why I find some of its twee quirkiness quite bothersome. It doesn’t happen often, but <em>No, I’m Not a Human</em> isn’t as good at tying the room up with a quip as it is at pulling the rug from beneath you, but this can be considered a mutation of traits that people bring with them.</p>

<h2><em>No, I'm Not a Human&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>No, I’m Not a Human</em> is a game of ironies. Completely removed from pretension, it’s a relay of affirmations and comfort, despite its harrowing presentation of how it looks when the gloves are off. While it may be disappointing to state that this isn’t a horror game in its most blase definition, what lies in store is an unbelievably brilliant depiction of paranoia, disgust, and what it’s like to lose control. Prepare for the worst, and expect the best.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humans are smart, so we know deep down that every attempt we make to classify the things we create is fraught with peril, because so much of what we create evades strict definition. But humans are also humans, meaning we can't resist doing it anyway.</p><p>Few examples of this are more annoying to people into video games than <em>video games</em>, where genre labels are constantly being stretched, and we feel the need to cram years upon years of the medium's history into the easily-digestible idea of console generations. One of the most annoying examples of this are the ways we continually try--and fail--to describe the scale of a video game's creation.</p><p>We appear to have settled on labels like "AAA" (big, expensive game"), "AA" (smaller, cheaper game but still feels somewhat expensive?) and "Indie", which can mean whatever the person using the label wants it to mean. Terms like this can be useful in <em>some </em>ways--someone describing the sickness at the heart of AAA game development is getting their point across--but pointless in others.</p><p>Which is why I'm very into<a href="https://hushcrasher.substack.com/p/taxonomy-of-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this latest attempt by Antoine Mayerowitz and Julie Belzanne</a> to throw those old labels in the bin and replace them with new ones, which have fresh flaws of their own but are no less interesting because of them.</p><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://hushcrasher.substack.com/p/taxonomy-of-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hushcrasher</a></figcaption></figure><p>Eschewing the idea that you can classify a game's development scale by "vibes" (which I don't necessarily agree with, as vibes are ethereal but also important) they instead, for the sake of being able to express this through data, looked at a whole bunch of games and sorted them according to a variety of factors, with two emerging as the most important: their size (in MBs) and the size of their credits list.</p><p>Again, this isn't perfect; QA testers are excluded, which I understand for data's sake given it's hard to nail down exact numbers, but disagree with philosophically. And classifying games based on those two factors but not also their overall cost in dollar terms--a bigger team size and game size will <em>usually </em>suggest a bigger budget, but not always!--feels like it's going to throw up some weird results as well.</p><p>Like I've said though, I'm not interested in this because I think it's objectively a better way of classifying games, but because it's refreshingly <em>different</em>. And also because as you can see from the cluster of results they found that there are definitely some broad trends (and clear "clusters") you can pick up on here.</p><p>They call this the Hushcrasher Classification System, and say its main point is that it's been "designed to cut through the noise". There is a lot more to it than my broad little introduction there; <a href="https://hushcrasher.substack.com/p/taxonomy-of-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I encourage you to read the whole proposal, which contains a bunch of sales and (old) genre data supporting their new labels</a>.</p><p>And if you want to map any game you want to the chart?<a href="https://hushcrasher.com/tools/classification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> You can do that here too; see where it stacks up</a>!</p><p>[Thanks<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arvy.bsky.social/post/3lys4nzsnkc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Arvy</a>!]</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?

Michael Ironside has voiced Sam in most of the Splinter Cell video games to date, but the role was also played by Eric Johnson in Splinter Cell: Blacklist, the most recent game in the series. The Sandman's Kirby Howell-Baptiste is voicing a new agent, Zinnia McKenna, alongside Janet Varney as Anna "Grim" Grímsdóttir, and Joel Oulette as Thunder.</p><p>John Wick co-creator Derek Kolstad is the head writer and producer for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, and the animation was provided by Sun Creature Studio and Fost. Netflix will debut the series on October 14.</p><p>On the video game front, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splinter-cell-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-548587">a Splinter Cell remake</a> in development, but there hasn't been many updates about that game since it was announced in 2022. Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shows-it-hasnt-totally-forgotten-about-splinter-cell/1100-6531177/" data-ref-id="1100-6531177">added Steam achievements to Splinter Cell: Blacklist</a>, which was released in 2013.</p>

From an outside perspective, I think it was probably fairly obvious that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> was never going to do very well. There was barely any game to show off, so they mostly didn't. What they did show didn't look very good either, and when it came out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-launches-to-clips-of-atvs-glitchily-spaghettifying-a-bloke-named-seb-but-a-patch-is-on-the-way">it was a glitchy mess</a>. This all put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-director-reportedly-says-the-studio-will-relaunch-the-game-as-around-300-staff-are-at-risk-of-being-laid-off">300 staff members at risk of being laid off</a>, the full extent of which still being not particularly clear. And in a recent interview, the game's lead actor Alex Hernandez has shared his own experience of being the face of the game (spoiler alert: it's not great).
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7hKUUUpUZQOt0HARxTlpvl">FRVR Podcast</a>, Hernandez spoke of what it was like having his face attached to such a mess of a game, quite plainly saying, "It's hard. I'm not gonna lie about that. It’s a difficult thing to spend two-and-a-half years on a project that you’re really proud of and you’re proud of your contribution to it… for the 300 or so employees at Build A Rocket Boy, you're like 'I hope this goes really well.' I want them all to get raises and have a giant party and have this be the job that launches their career."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the more upsetting thing to hear Hernandez say was how his name will "now be associated with something that many people have regarded as pretty f*****g bad. And as an artist, as a man, as a gamer, that hurts, it's wildly painful." This is an aspect of an increased use of motion and facial capture we're not really thinking of.
</p>
<p>
My best guess is that actors' real faces are being used more and more to help get better and more believable in-game performances (those who know better feel free to sound off in the comments). The trade-off here is that you are then thrusting some of these actors into the spotlight, one which features a community that, as many of us know, isn't always the kindest, and I am putting that as politely as possible.
</p><p>
Personally, I always prefer a tightly designed character over motion capture anyway - even if I did enjoy getting a first-person perspective of Mads Mikkelsen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> - but perhaps there's yet another lesson to be learned here in the need for safeguards to be put in place for the people that are being put at the front of high profile games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The respected Jeux Vidéo Magazine have done something unusual, they posted some rumours about an upcoming game. They have done an investigation themselves rather than rely on a third party and the game in question is the currently unannounced remake of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, a title that has<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/29/edward-kenways-voice-actor-hints-at-a-black-flag-remake/"> leaked</a> on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>It seems like the remake, which will use Anvil Pipeline engine, is going to feature some fairly big changes. The most notable change will be the removal of all the modern-day sequences so we will not see Rebbeca, Shaun and the others. The modern-day plot, which worked really well in the first few games with Desmond, has gradually been sidelined and only appears as text in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Replacing it will be “a few extra hours of content” including content that was cut from the original release, such as parts of Mary Read’s story.</p>


<p>Gameplay is said to be closer to the RPG style of the more recent games with loot, stats for weapons, and a new inventory. The combat is is also said to lean more towards the style of the recent games. The map is the same size but will have more things to do, and modern systems mean there will be no loading screens when docking your ship and heading to land.</p>
<p>The report suggests the game will now launch in early 2026, probably March, which is a little later than previous reports. Ubisoft Singapore, Belgrade and Bordeaux are working on it, and some assets from Skull &amp; Bones may be reused to save costs.</p>
<p>Finally, we should not expect a remake of the same level as Resident Evil 2, but better than a remaster.</p>

<p>Ubisoft have yet to reveal the Black Flag remake, but it does seem only a matter of time.&nbsp; We gave the original release<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/10/30/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-review/"> 9/10 back in 2013</a></p>
<p>“Black Flag is more than just a return to form for Assassin’s Creed, it is an overall improvement and probably the best game in the series yet,” said Gareth. “It has taken the gameplay of the previous games, refined it, and combined it with a huge open world that is packed with enough content to literally last for days. If you have ever wanted a proper pirate game, this is as good as it gets.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-shift-codes-and-gold-keys-work-in-borderlands-4.1299771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is out now! Yay, that’s exciting. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">However, on PC, it has some performance problems</a> that might dampen your enjoyment. But hey, whatever, you’re here because you want to figure out how Shift Codes work and how to get Gold Keys in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> It’s a weird and some might say unnecessary system, but I’ll help walk you through it. And by the end you’ll be good to go.</p> <p>First, before we go any further, you need to create a free Shift account. Shift is Gearbox’s very own video game network… thing. It has been around since <em>Borderlands 2</em>, and the website for Shift has basically not changed since then, so it looks old, but it is pretty easy to use. Just hop over to the <a href="https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/home">Shift site and make a free account.</a> Next, you’ll want to link whatever platform you play on, like Xbox, to your new Shift account. To do that, look to the top left of the website and click “Gaming Platforms.” Then select your platform and follow the steps to log in and get everything all synced up. Okay, now, you can start redeeming Shift codes. But first…</p> <h3>What Are Shift Codes?</h3> <p>That’s a great question! Here’s a sticker. Shift codes are alphanumeric codes that are handed out by official Gearbox and <em>Borderlands</em>-related accounts, often on social media. These codes will provide an in-game reward when correctly redeemed. Many people can use a single Shift code, but they often have expiration dates, so older codes might not work.</p>

 <p>One of the best and most frequent providers of new Shift codes is Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford himself, so you might want to follow him on X. Sorry about that. And no, I don’t think Pitchford pushed to create Shift simply to get more followers online, but it’s a funny theory.</p> <p>Technically, Shift codes exist for other Gearbox games, like <em>Aliens: Colonial Marines and Battleborn</em>, but uh… well, these days, 99 percent of Shift codes are connected to <em>Borderlands</em> and <em>Wonderlands</em> because nobody plays Gearbox’s other games. Anyway, once you have a Shift code, either from Pitchford or one of the many fan sites and accounts that catalog them, it’s time to enter that code on the Shift website!</p>

 <h2>How Do I Use A Shift Code?</h2> <p>There are two ways to enter a Shift code and gain its rewards. The first, and worst way, is to boot up the game the Shift code is connected to and enter the code via that title’s Shift screen. This is a cumbersome way to do this and has no benefits and many drawbacks. Do you really want to enter a long string of letters and numbers with an Xbox gamepad and on-screen keyboard? Nah.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626109">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The better way to use your Shift Codes is to do so on your phone or PC. Once you’re logged into your Shift account, you can just copy the code and hop over to the website. Then you just click “Rewards” and pop your Shift code into the empty box.</p>

 <p>Depending on the code, you’ll likely need to specify a platform. So, for example, if you put in a Shift code for a Gold Key in<em> Borderlands 4</em>, the game will ask you what platforms you want to redeem it on and show you every platform you have linked. Fun fact: Most codes can be reused for each connected platform. If you enter it in correctly, you’ll get a prompt letting you know, and the rewards feed below where you entered the code will update to show you what you just earned, in what game, and on which platform.</p> <h2>Wait, I Want Gold Keys, Not Shift Codes!</h2> <p>Calm down. Shift codes are how you get Gold Keys. And while it is true that not all Shift codes provide Gold Keys for various <em>Borderlands</em> games—some provide cosmetics and other bonuses—the vast majority of codes in 2025 will give you Gold Keys.</p>

 <p>Just keep in mind that Gold Keys, once redeemed, can’t be used in any other <em>Borderlands</em> game. I have nearly 80 of the bastards waiting to be used in<em> Borderlands 3</em>, but none of them can make the leap to <em>Borderlands 4.</em> It makes me very sad.</p> <h2>How Do I Use These Gold Keys In <em>Borderlands 4</em>?</h2> <p>All Gold Keys in all <em>Borderlands</em> titles, including<em> Borderlands 4</em>, are used to open big gold chests that can be found in the hub areas of the various games. These chests have a high chance of dropping really good loot, including rare legendary guns and gear. In<em> Borderlands 4,</em> there are actually a few gold chests located at various safehouses and other points of interest, but be aware you can’t open a Gold chest until you unlock the Outbounder’s village near the starting area of the game in the Fadefields.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To use a key, just go up to the chest and hit the open button. But be warned! You really shouldn’t do this until you are at least level 40, as early on in the game you’ll likely just replace whatever you get with better gear quickly as you level up. Also, if you’re playing with randos or greedy friends, be aware that the gear you get from the chest will fly out of it after 30 seconds or so, and at that point, anyone can grab it. This happened to me. I lost a great revolver. My friends laughed. I grew more bitter.</p> <p>And that’s all you need to know about Shift codes and Gold Keys. If you want lots of Shift Codes for <em>Borderlands 4,</em> <a href="https://x.com/borderlandshub/status/1968030270847922295">I’d recommend this account on Twitter</a> that rounds them all up and posts them with a direct link to the Shift site, making it easy to snag some codes and keys on your phone while you are out and about. Or follow Randy Pitchford on Twitter, I guess?</p>

The clear winner is Lugia V (Alternate Full Art) 186/195, which has surged 68% since July to $427, cementing itself as the set’s chase card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainer Gallery standouts like Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 and Blaziken VMAX TG15/TG30 have also doubled or tripled in value thanks to strong artwork and nostalgia, while even Lugia VSTAR continues climbing on competitive strength. At the same time, cards like Regidrago V (Alternate Art) and Alolan Vulpix VSTAR have cooled as the meta shifted away from them, with values slipping back toward the $12–$14 range. </p><p id="snag-classic-mega-evolution-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards">Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards Before Market Rise</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market for XY-era Mega Evolution Pokémon cards is heating up fast ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the upcoming Mega Evolution TCG set. Collectors aren’t waiting for modern reprints, they’re chasing the originals, and prices are showing it. Some cards have exploded in value, while others have steadied after sharp climbs, creating both momentum plays and entry points for buyers. Leading the surge is M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art - Ancient Origins), which has skyrocketed over 426% this year, from $275 in January to $1,450 today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare - Phantom Forces) isn’t far behind, up nearly fivefold to $415, cementing its place as one of the most sought-after Megas. Other heavy-hitters include M Rayquaza EX (Full Art - Roaring Skies), now at $656, M Charizard EX (X - Flashfire) climbing past $349, and Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art), which has more than doubled to $349. These climbers show how nostalgia, unique mechanics, and iconic artwork are driving a collector frenzy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But not every Mega Evolution is running away in price. Some cards have plateaued after strong early-year gains, leaving a rare buying window before the next spike. M Mewtwo EX (Full Art - BREAKthrough) climbed from $37 to $145 but has leveled off in recent weeks, while M Alakazam EX (Full Art - Fates Collide) sits steady just under $100 after jumping from $28 earlier this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Charizard is showing signs of cooling, M Charizard EX (Generations) and M Charizard EX (Full Art - Evolutions) have tripled since January but are holding in the $190-$200 range for now. These pauses don’t signal weakness; rather, they reflect consolidation before the broader Mega Evolution wave hits with new set releases. For collectors and investors, the message is clear: the grails are climbing fast, but the plateaued cards may be the smarter pickups before Mega hype takes over the market again.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Crown Zenith Prices Are Rising</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crown Zenith market has been showing two very different stories this month.

This split reflects a maturing market: casual collectors are less interested in mid-tier Eeveelutions and V cards, while serious players and investors are doubling down on the big four golds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the crashers, Leafeon VSTAR has fallen from nearly $50 to the $43 range, and Glaceon VSTAR is down 26% since February, hovering in the mid-$30s. Deoxys VMAX has slipped under $37, while Suicune V and Raikou V both lost more than a quarter of their value since spring. These are still striking artworks, but set fatigue and limited competitive relevance are pushing prices down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the climbers are commanding all the attention. Giratina VSTAR (Secret) has surged nearly 20% since July to $180, making it the definitive chase of Crown Zenith. Mewtwo VSTAR is also up more than 30% this summer, with its Charizard battle artwork driving collector demand. Rounding out the gains, Arceus VSTAR, Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR, and Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR are all trending higher as well, thanks to their powerful abilities and limited supply. Taken together, the set still holds broad collector appeal, but it’s clear the market is consolidating around the golden Secret Rares as the safest long-term holds.</p><p id="first-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="First Party Switch 2 Preorders">First Party Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s 2025 first-party lineup is shaping up to be one of its strongest in years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake from Ubisoft being in the works is one of the videogame industry's currently running open secrets. It's not been officially announced, but there have been several <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/">rumors</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">leaks</a> pointing towards it being in development for years now, not to mention the fact that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">previously confirmed that remakes of Assassin's Creed games are coming</a>. </p>



<p>But as it's still not officially confirmed, everything we know about it should, technically, be taken with a grain of salt. Today, a new rumor from Jeux Vidéo Magazine, who have previously reported accurate unannounced information about the Assassin's Creed series, added more salt to the pile, though in a slightly unexpected way.</p>



<p>In the video, Jeux Vidéo Magazine alleges that there are a few significant changes being made to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag for this remake. One major change is that the game will reportedly lean more into the RPG side of Assassin's Creed that's been building since the release of Assassin's Creed Origins. Edward will even have stats for his gear.</p>



<p>Jeux Vidéo Magazine also claims that the parts of the game set in the modern day are being removed and replaced by more time spent with Edward Kenway on various pirating adventures. The map isn't getting bigger, but there will be new quests and more to do in the game, loading screens between being in your ship and being on land are gone, it'll bring back content that was cut from the game back in 2013, and it'll be out sometime in the first half of 2026, potentially during March, were among the other big claims Jeux Vidéo Magazine made regarding the remake.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Exclu ! Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag Remake : Nos 1ères INFORMATIONS en EXCLUSIVITÉ 🔥" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qngrBQnukFc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Again, the remake itself hasn't even been confirmed by Ubisoft, so take all of these claims with the appropriate amount of salt, even considering that Jeux Vidéo Magazine has been right with leaks similar to this in the past. </p>



<p>But if even a few of those claims end up being true, specifically the removal of modern-day elements and the gameplay changes to make everything lean more towards Ubisoft's RPG era of Assassin's Creed games, then this will be a fairly significant remake compared to the original.</p>



<p>It also opens up interesting thoughts about the rest of the remakes Guillemot has confirmed Ubisoft is working on. Will the rest of the series get a makeover to be closer to the RPGs of late? Are each of the modern-day sections in the games going to be overhauled in some way? Ubisoft has previously discussed that it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-talks-about-the-modern-setting-storyline-in-shadows/">struggled with merging the modern-day story into its historical epics</a>. Could this be a step towards beginning to do away with it or permanently change it?</p>



<p>Those, and a lot more questions, open up if some of these alleged changes end up being true. We'll see what the truth is when Ubisoft finally does announce the remake.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturers Association has announced Game Store Day. This new event by the influential trade organization is part of a new initiative to support retail stores within the FLGS community and help promote the social aspects of the board game hobby.</p>

<h2>The Game Store Day Event Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a recent report,&nbsp;the Game Manufacturers Association has announced the new Game Store Day annual event will begin November 1, 2025. Retailers can register for this event on GAMA's website, which will include marketing and promotional materials as well prizes. Among those prizes are Origins Family Passes, which are good for four full badges to Origins Game Fair.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/game-store-day-site-banner-image.jpg?itok=O7UGXydQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/game-store-day-site-banner-image.jpg?itok=e8tnykd8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The choice to have Game Store Day close to November was a strategic one. According to the official <a href="https://www.gama.org/page/GSD" rel="nofollow">Game Store Day website</a>, GAMA was inspired by similar events like Independent Bookstore Day, Record Store Day, and the American Library Association's International Gaes Month.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Game Store Day was created to spotlight and support our retail game store members while establishing a day for the industry to celebrate the joy of playing games," said GAMA Executive Director John Stacy about the event. "Timed with the American Library Association’s International Games Month and the start of the holiday shopping season, it’s a meaningful way to bring communities together and champion local game stores as cultural hubs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This elevation of the tabletop hobby and of FLGS communities is an extension of GAMA code of conduct. The non-profit organization has helped enrich marginalized tabletop creatives through their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2024-gama-horizons-fellowship-offers-grants-to-diverse-creators-and-businesses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA Horizons Fellowship</a> program, curating their community by suspending bad actors like alt-right grifter <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-del-arroz-suspended-from-gama" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jon Del Arroz</a>, and fighting for the health of the tabletop industry by filing lawsuits against <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-joins-second-anti-tariff-lawsuit-against-trump-administration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unlawful tariffs</a>.</p>

<p>At time of writing, it is unclear how structured the Game Store Day annual event will be. Given that most hobby stores tend to accommodate to either <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, or <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, there's a chance one of those games can serve as a tentpole. Either way, the attempt to highlight the joy of playing in-person at a table is an admirable one.</p>

There are a bevy of games available in the world that let you play as what can only be described as "a little guy." However, you can throw all of them out of the window, because I have found the game that has the perfect iteration of such a creature. It is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/letters-to-arralla">Letters to Arralla</a>, and in it you quite simply play as a turnip, who has the juiciest derriere I've ever seen in perhaps any game ever. Yes, even more so than one of those anime gacha games, this turnip's rump has got some serious jiggle physics.
</p>
<p>
A turnip with a pleasant dumptruck does not a game make, though, so here's the lowdown: you deliver mail! There are plenty of equally funny "little guys" who you can bring mail to on an Australian island, with the added benefit of being able to open said mail. As the game's Steam page notes, this is a crime - no, really, don't read other people's mail, it's not allowed - but apparently in Letter to Arralla's world it's encouraged!
</p>

<p>
Said pieces of mail include pictogram puzzles you have to solve, and throughout your journey you'll also need to help the island's inhabitants figure out personal problems. There's no pressure to do anything at any particular time, you're welcome to play around, "throw stuff," and even "call your mum!"
</p><p>
We might be heading into autumn in this hemisphere, but Australian developer Little Pink Clouds will slowly be making their way towards summer, and that's exactly the kind of vibe this game gives off. Summer is arguably a video game genre unto itself, with games like Super Mario Sunshine, Outrun, and Boku no Natsuyasumi all being peak examples of such a thing. I think Letters to Arralla could fit quite neatly into that, so it's one I hope to be able to make time for. Even if it's only to warm myself back up again.
</p>
<p>
It's also out today! And you can pick it up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2189310/Letters_to_Arralla/">here</a>.

Developer Full Circle has now reacted to player complaints about server queues. At the same time, people are logging into the game to find it requires a constant internet connection--something Full Circle warned about months ago but isn't going down well with the community today</p><h2><strong>Server queues</strong></h2><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968012562668179865" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, developer Full Circle said there are "a LOT" of players trying to join the Skate servers today for launch, and that to mitigate the issues, server queues have been put in place.

They can still be annoying, though, as players understandably do not want to wait to play. Some people in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/top/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skate subreddit</a> have said they finally got to the front of the queue and joined a session, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1nioad0/this_sucks/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only to be kicked out due to server issues</a></p><hr><h2><strong>Always-online complaints</strong></h2><p>The new Skate is an always-online game--something Full Circle disclosed back in April. At the time, the developer said this was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">necessary due to how the new Skate was designed.</a></p><p>"The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving," the studio said. "You'll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities."</p><p>Full Circle added: "In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection."</p><p>But now that Skate has gone live, many are expressing frustration with the always-online requirement. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/top/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Many posts in the Skate subreddit </a>include people voicing their frustration with this, prompting some people to call on EA and Full Circle to release an offline mode.</p><p>Given what Full Circle has said about always-online being a core part of Skate's design, that might be wishful thinking.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeGXanmlJ_0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DeGXanmlJ_0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>Skate is not 1.0 yet</strong></h2><p>The new Skate launched today as an early access product, meaning development is not finished and that, as with other unfinished games, there are going to be bugs and other oddities that players encounter. Full Circle has said it will pore over the feedback from the early access launch to try to improve the experience.</p><h2><strong>Steam stats</strong></h2><p>At launch, Skate has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already surpassed 78,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, making it the No. 10 most-played game on Steam right now. And that's just a fraction of the game's total audience, as it's also available elsewhere on PC and on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

              <p>The official trailer for Netflix and Ubisoft’s upcoming animated series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-anime-netflix-2000619516"><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em></a>, gives us a much better look at this new version of Sam Fisher and lets us hear more of Liev Schreiber as the aging operative. And while I was nervous at first, I now feel confident that Schreiber can pull this off. Now let’s just hope the show itself is good, too.</p> <p>On September 16, Ubisoft released the <a href="https://youtu.be/4A9iFjaKeMk">official trailer for <em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em></a>. The new animated show adapts Ubisoft’s popular stealth-action video game franchise into an episodic series that will premiere on Netflix exclusively on October 14. Here’s the trailer, which features Sam Fisher doing what you expect: sneaking around, wearing cool goggles, killing people with wire, and being cranky about stuff.</p>  <p>We get to hear more of Liev Schreiber’s take on Sam Fisher, and while it is different than the version established by Michael Ironside, I appreciate that he still sounds like an old guy who is about to snap at any point, and if he does, God help anyone caught in his way. While I’ll miss Ironside, who voiced the character in the original games, I’m happy that Sam is in good hands. <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698">And honestly, I’m just excited to get more <em>Splinter Cell</em> in any form</a>.</p>

 <p>In this new trailer, we learn more about what this show is actually about.&nbsp; After a younger agent, Zinnia, gets her hands on some valuable intel, she comes to Sam Fisher for help. This brings Fisher into a mission that involves <a href="https://splintercell.fandom.com/wiki/Douglas_Shetland">Douglas Shetland, a villainous character</a> and former friend from the<em> Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow </em>and <em>Chaos Theory</em> games. His daughter is all grown up and running what appears to be an evil corporation of some kind. Uh oh!</p> <p>Interestingly, in the trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/8c-Jshz9PVc">we briefly see the ending of <em>Chaos Theory,</em></a> with Sam and Douglas standing with guns pointed at each other. It also seems like this series makes it canon that Sam Fisher shot Shetland. In the game, it was a choice between shooting him and not shooting him. If you didn’t pull the trigger, Shetland would shoot at Sam, forcing him to dodge Shetland’s attack before stabbing and killing him. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-poster-derek-kolstad-interview#:~:text=So%20is%20Splinter,fits%20the%20mold.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">It’s not 100% clear yet if <em>Deathwatch</em> is canon with the games</a>, but if it is, I wonder what else the show will introduce into the franchise’s (surprisingly) sprawling lore.</p> <p><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch </em>is being written and produced by <em>John Wick</em> writer Derek Kolstad. It will be available on Netflix on October 14.</p>
