                <p>At <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, Bandai Namco revealed a teaser for Code Vein 2, a sequel to its 2019 action-RPG that many described as an anime Dark Souls. This sequel has an updated aesthetic while still retaining anime character designs for its male protagonist.</p><p>While its predecessor was set in a post-apocalyptic future, this one seems to have a dark medieval fantasy setting, although the twist appears to be that it will also be crossing different timelines. What's clear is that will still have many formidable boss fights. It's coming in 2026 to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

                <p>Capcom has been on a roll with resurrecting its best franchises, and its latest attempt is Onimusha. Onimusha: Way of the Sword first debuted at The Game Awards in December 2024, and now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V14PfpEqA0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latest trailer</a> is giving us a closer look at the gameplay as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Games Fest 2025</a> show.</p><p>We already knew that Onimusha: Way of the Sword would feature Musashi Miyamoto, the legendary historical swordsman, as the protagonist, and would be using the face of Toshiro Mifune, star of classic samurai films like Yojimbo and Seven Samuria. Now, though, it looks like we're getting deeper into the Musashi lore, as his archrival, Kojiro/Ganryu Sasaki, appears in the trailer, looking like he might be the lead antagonist.</p><p> As for gameplay, it looks like the game will make heavy use of parrying; we see Musashi parrying attacks big and small throughout the trailer. Additionally, it seems like the other weapons he picks up throughout the game will also take advantage of the dual-wielding techniques Musashi is known for in both history and historical fiction.</p><p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to release in 2026.</p>

As a Raider, players have to regularly journey to the surface so that they can scavenge for supplies, but they'll also have to watch out for rival players looking to steal their loot.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders | Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A closed technical test for Arc Raiders was held last month, and executive producer Aleksander Grøndal said that it provided valuable feedback for the studio as it heads into the final stretch of development.</p><p dir="ltr">"The test also honed in on concrete things we’re addressing in this last stretch of development," Grøndal said in a press release. "There are bugs to squash, as well as general polish and performance improvements to be done. We're also fine-tuning game balance and the player economy, and will work on an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre. At release, the game will be further expanded, with more locations to explore, more adventures to embark on, and more for players to strive towards and discover."</p><p>There have been some big changes made to Arc Raiders over the years, as it was originally billed as a PvE shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-delay-has-completely-changed-its-genre/1100-6514238/">before the focus shifted</a> toward developing it into a PvPvE extraction shooter. Arc Raiders was also first announced as a free-to-play title, but last year,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-new-game-dumps-free-to-play-model-changes-to-40-premium-release/1100-6525993/">those plans changed and the game will cost $40</a> when it launches.</p>

                <p>Developer Mundfish is looking to expand Atomic Heart from a game to a franchise, and it's doing so with not one but two new games. A full sequel, Atomic Heart 2, is on the way, alongside a more experimental multiplayer title with a reality-bending twist called The Cube.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced during Summer Game Fest and taking place after the first game--which was set in a retro-futuristic 1950s Soviet Union--Atomic Heart 2 will begin with the "world on the brink of collapse," and it will see players head to more diverse locations. Mundfish says the story is now on "a global scale," but it's unclear just where we'll actually be going.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquBSxalY1Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fquBSxalY1Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Like the first game, there will be role-playing elements, which will be deeper this time around, as well as a dual-wielding combat system that will let players combine glove abilities (special tech-based attacks) with melee weapons and guns. It's here where the studio's BioShock influence is perhaps most clear, letting players find their ideal combination as they blast away at machines.</p><p dir="ltr">No release window was given for Atomic Heart 2, but it's not the only Atomic Heart game on the way. Mundfish also revealed The Cube, an MMO spin-off that takes place after the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Several years after the events of Atomic Heart, the world stands on the brink of a new threat," reads a line in the official announcement. "A mysterious giant levitating structure known as The Cube has become the epicenter of increasingly dangerous phenomena, and in order to save humanity, players must plunge deep into its secrets--and survive."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHHJM-KZfss" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YHHJM-KZfss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Cube (the structure) is more than meets the eye, with an "equation" hidden inside that can drastically alter reality. Failure to solve the equation will mean the destruction of the human race.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's environments will constantly change, with "rows and edges" appearing and new enemies popping up, and hidden quests are scattered throughout the world. There will also be "persistent progression" that won't be halted by "failure," though Mundfish didn't clarify exactly what that means.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Atomic Heart 2, The Cube doesn't have a release window yet. Both games are coming to consoles as well as PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A new Game of Thrones RTS has been announced as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a> show. Australian developer PlaySide Studios and Warner Bros. have announced Game of Thrones: War for Westeros, and it's set for launch in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is described as a "classic, premium real-time strategy game" for PC that's set in the world of Westeros. Players will take control of one of the fiction's legendary Houses (Stark, Targaryen, or Lannister), or the Night King, with the aim of conquering the Seven Kingdoms. The game has a single-player campaign and multiplayer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI9MDe0evFU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uI9MDe0evFU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Each faction in War for Westeros has its own unique heroes, armies, and mechanics, and players are able to dispatch ground troops, cavalry, siege engines, giants, and dragons to gain the upper hand. Some of the locations that will appear in the game include the Wall and King's Landing.</p><p dir="ltr">Game director Ryan McMahon said War for Westeros aims to deliver the wish fulfillment of basically playing the popular Game of Thrones TV show. "This time, you're not watching Game of Thrones, you're playing it," the developer said.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Warner Bros. management said it would focus on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wbs-gaming-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6529747/" data-ref-id="1100-6529747">four major franchises going forward</a> with respect to its gaming endeavors: Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, and DC.</p><p dir="ltr">PlaySide Studios has worked on numerous licensed games over the years, including The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners, The Godfather, Jumanji: Epic Run, Legally Blonde: The Game, and Cars Lightning League. It is also publishing Mouse: P.I. For Hire, a cartoon-style shooter based on Mickey Mouse.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during Summer Game Fest Live with Geoff Keighley, Raw Power Games--a new Copenhagen-based studio featuring devs who previously worked on games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Grand Theft Auto--unveiled its first project. The game is called Chronicles: Medieval, and it is an action-RPG where each player's choice will create an experience "where no two stories are ever the same."</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement trailer shown at SGF Live--with voiceover provided by Tom Hardy--showed a cinematic scene alternating between a blacksmith preparing a sword, a soldier walking to the front of his army, and other scenes. Eventually, the soldier mounts his horse, raises his sword, and the army charges into battle as the trailer shifts from cinematics to actual gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507595-chronicles.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507595-chronicles.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507595"></a><figcaption>Chronicles: Medieval</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507595-chronicles.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Chronicles: Medieval features an "immersive medieval sandbox" where players will create their own characters and venture into the world, which will be influenced by their decisions. Each player must choose one of three story paths--power, adventure, or fortune--for their character, after which they must balance diplomacy and outright conflict in order to progress.</p><p dir="ltr">Those conflicts will be fought in large-scale battles, where players can recruit and train troops, and then lead them into battle with full control over how their trained soldiers approach and attack the opposing side. Meanwhile, the player will be controlling their created character, who will be in the thick of things fighting alongside recruited troops.</p><p dir="ltr">Raw Power Games has also revealed that it will be fully supporting the modding community at launch, pledging that it will give players the "freedom, support, and technology" needed to create new content for the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While no specific release date was shared, Chronicles: Medieval is scheduled to launch in early access on PC via Steam in 2026.</p>

                <p>What do combat sports look like if fuzzy Muppet-like characters are swinging the punches? Felt That: Boxing answers this question you didn't know you had until now.

                <p>End of Abyss gets a brand-new trailer at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest </a>from Section 9, former developers behind the horror series Little Nightmares. Featuring a rather mysterious tone and some very dark corridors, this new trailer sets the tone right away to be quite creepy. The top-down shooter and survival title will be out sometime in 2026 for PlayStation and PC, where it'll be exclusive to Epic Games Store.</p><p>The new trailer features a dark, atmospheric mood with the lone protagonist venturing into a deep subterranean structure full of strange biological creatures that look like something straight out of The Thing. A strange voice from a cube-like object delivers some mysterious lines like, "We are waiting for you."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hV2Cu-grqU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1hV2Cu-grqU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Of course, like most horror games, this is not going to be a very pleasant trip. Gameplay shows a top-down-shooter type of experience with the player able to aim a pistol and scan objects in the environment. One different weapon is shown very quickly with what looks like a shotgun as the main character uses it against a mutated, zombie-like creature bearing down on them. The pace of the action looks methodical, but fast-paced and similar to recent Resident Evil titles. Fans of survival-horror will definitely want to check this one out once it hits in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/killer-inn-is-square-enixs-take-on-among-us<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Social deduction games are all the rage these days, thanks to viral hits like Among Us, and today, during Summer Game Fest, Square Enix announced its plans to release its own take on the genre. Killer Inn is an asymmetrical action game where 24 players enter a mansion, secretly divided into two factions – 8 wolves and 16 sheep. Throughout a match, players will lie, steal, and murder to claim victory over the other secret group. In addition to today's reveal trailer, we got a behind-the-scenes look at what an average match would look like.</p><p>After the game privately reveals whether you're a wolf or a lamb, everyone begins to gather items and weapons. They can be hidden in drawers, set on tables, or, if it's an especially good find, purchased from shops. Players can also complete quests to level up skills and open chests with better gear – a good idea to do before the first body is discovered or you become the first victim.</p><p>Once a body is discovered, players can visit the scene of the crime to learn clues about the killer, like what color hair they have, what they were wearing, or if they left other DNA at the scene of the crime. Once the lambs think they know who to go after, they can take full advantage of the game's third-person action to shoot, punch, poison, or stab the suspect. That said, you have to be certain they're a wolf before it starts, because a lamb who goes after another lamb turns to stone and dies.</p>

</article>
<p>There are also safe zones – any room in a staff member's eyeline – where wolves that kill lambs are immediately outed. Lambs can stay here in relative safety, but staying put means the wolves have a chance to gather more powerful gear, and they'll know exactly where you are once they find you.</p><p>Finally, each player controls a different, pre-set character with unique abilities they get when leveling up. The surgeon does extra damage while covered in blood, the thief can pick locks without leaving clues behind, and the handyman can upgrade gear at half the cost. The image we saw has 25 characters listed, and since each match has 24 players, you'll likely be seeing most characters every match.</p><p>The game is being developed by Tactic Studio in collaboration with Square Enix and TBS Games. While the trailer didn't reveal anything about Killer Inn's launch window, we do know that a closed beta on Steam will begin sometime soon, so players will have the chance to kill or be killed before buying the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As its name implies, it's set within a massive leviathan structure called The Cube, the epicenter of increasingly dangerous phenomena. You and other players must dive into its secrets and survive to save humanity.</p><p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/03/the-2025-summer-showcase-schedule">today's Summer Game Fest showcase</a>, Mundfish says The Cube will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, though it didn't reveal when.&nbsp;</p><p>"On the surface, it's a geometrically perfect object, but in truth, it's an anomalous, shifting place swarming with vicious enemies," a press release reads. "But most terrifying of all is the equation hidden at the Cube's core. Deciphering the equation can save humanity, failing to do so means extinction. But beware, the Cube can flip everything in an instant – as the world shifts, so do you."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can check out The Cube reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szdA4dQqUhs"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szdA4dQqUhs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see in the reveal trailer, this massive cube features constantly rotating rows and edges that create unexpected scenarios and environmental combinations alongside new combat challenges. Mundfish says The Cube features deep and persistent progression and customization, a wide choice of weapons and skills, powerful bosses and enemies, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>"An innovative Split-Rendering System [...] transforms how motion is handled in interactive environments," the press release reads. "This proprietary technology powers the dynamic world of The Cube, enabling seamless transitions, intelligent object tracking, and multiplayer synchronization."&nbsp;</p><p>The Cube launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> likes his puppets, so he told us during this evening's Summer Game Fest opening night, so it seems fitting that he introduced us all to a puppet-fronted boxing game. Yes, you read that right. A puppet-fronted boxing game.</p>
<p>It's known as Felt That: Boxing, and is described as a "comedic boxing game set in a world where the charm of furry puppets collides with the fury of boxing". Players will step into the shoes of Ezra "Fuzz-E" Wright, who developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Sans%20Strings%20Studio&amp;snr=1_5_9__2000">Sans Strings Studio</a> (Oh, I get it) described as "an unlikely hero with a big heart".</p>
<p>Anyway, Fuzz-E has a quest, and in a tale as old as time, he has to battle his way through punch after punch after punch to save an orphanage. You can check out a trailer for Felt That: Boxing below.</p>

<p>We also get a peak at a rival of sorts, who crosses swords with Musashi and talks a lot of trash while doing so.</p>
<p>Onimusha Way of the Sword was first revealed at The Game Awards last year, and took the spotlight as one of the highlights of that show. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-look-at-new-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay-and-protagonist">Earlier this year we got the first peek at gameplay</a>, which is well worth checking out if you're hungry for everything Onimusha.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The roster of Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is expanding outside of the Sonic universe to include other Sega characters and beyond.
</p>
<p>
As announced at tonight's Summer Game Fest, joining the likes of Sonic, Tails and Knuckles will be Joker from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a> and Ichiban from the Like A Dragon games.
</p>
<p>
What's more, Vocaloid artist Hatsune Miku is joining too, along with Steve from Minecraft.

<p>
Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka took to the stage at the event to - in tongue-in-cheek fashion - announce Sonic Racing CrossWorlds will have cross-play, unlike a "certain other kart racer".
</p>
<p>
Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-reveals-sonic-racing-crossworlds-follow-up-to-team-sonic-racing">latest in the Sonic racing series</a>, introducing Travel Rings that transport racers to other dimensions.
</p>
<p>
It's set for release on 25th September across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam, Epic).

		<p>Felt That Boxing will likely be one of the most fun announcements from Summer Games Fest, as it is a brand new boxing game. Instead of big name boxers, Felt That Boxing puts you in the gloves of Fuzz-E who is trying to climb the boxing ladder to save the orphanage he grew up in. The trailer gives you a brief look at gameplay elements, including some unorthodox training and some mismatched boxing matches.</p>
<p><iframe title="Felt That: Boxing Official Trailer | Real-Time Puppet Boxing Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSZCdxMQjxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Felt That Boxing will have a story mode lasting around 8 to 12 hours, and every match has been described as a boss fight. It is an arcade style experience too, featuring power ups like anvil drops and pie throwing. You will be able to unlock different customisation options for Fuzz-E too as you make progress in Felt That Boxing.</p>
<p>Felt That Boxing is available to wishlist on Steam, and release date is yet to be announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/atomic-heart-2-and-the-cube-revealed-by-mundfish/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Atomic Heart developers Mundfish have revealed not one, but two successors to their 2022 first person shooter. Atomic Heart 2 will be a spiritual successor to the first game, while The Cube is an MMORPG shooter also set within the shared style and setting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomic Heart 2 - Announcement Trailer I SGF25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fquBSxalY1Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Atomic Heart 2 looks to bring much more freedom to the game, described on the SGF stage by Geoff Keighley as being a “spiritual successor” and having greater emphasis on RPG freedoms. There is still plenty of common style to the retro futuristic technology and global setting, taking a bit of a step away from the Soviet setting of the first game, but with plenty of crossover in terms of what the tech looks like. We do see much more freedom in the form of hang gliding and broader environments.</p>
<p><iframe title="The CUBE - Announcement Trailer I SGF25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHHJM-KZfss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Cube, meanwhile, is an MMORPG shooter in the same kind of setting. Here it’s all about head-to-head shooter action where a giant cube has revealed itself to the world… maybe… and this provides an ever-shifting battlefield.</p>

<p>We said of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/23/atomic-heart-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">original game</a>:</p>
<p><em>Atomic Heart is a bit of a surprise. It’s not perfect and the open world is an unneeded dilution, but when you’re in the story missions it’s always entertaining, despite occasionally dragging things out a little. It can be a bit strange, but it’s the self aware kind of strange that can be a bit charming. And the robots are pretty great.</em></p>

		<p>Code Vein II, a sequel to the 2019 Soulslike by Bandai Namco, has been revealed. The game is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, coming in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="CODE VEIN II – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRRhNJ_25U4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“If time were a weapon to wield, could you undo the sins of ruin? Bound By Blood, Revenants gather once more,” says the trailer blurb.</p>
<p>Of course, the game isn’t really doing much to dispel the notion that it’s an anime Soulslike. In fact, it seems to lean even further into the Souls-y vibes than the first game. There’s plenty of huge horrors and dark fantasy here, and then there’s some big portals and giant bosses. You do get to ride a motorbike, though.</p>
<p>When Miguel reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">Code Vein</a>, aka Anime Souls, he wrote:</p>

<p><em>Code Vein is addictive, yet frustrating. It’s promising, yet unpolished. There are a lot of interesting ideas here that come together to craft a unique and engaging experience. I just wish that the flaws here weren’t so glaring, because they keep Code Vein from being a great game instead of just a good one.</em></p>

		<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has been given release date and the new racing game will be out on September 25th. Additionally, SEGA has confirmed that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will feature cross platform play, so you can race online against players on other platforms. There was a slightly cheeky comment about a certain other kart racer not being able to do that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Summer Game Fest Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzhXbukaCSU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer also revealed three new guest characters for Sonic Racing: Crossworlds including Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga from Like A Dragon, and Joker from Persona 5. Additionally, there was also a tease with a Minecraft crossover, though details are scant on that. The game’s description says, “<em>“Race across land, sea, air, space, and time in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds! Warp through Travel Rings into new dimensions where something new awaits around every twist and turn. Speed to victory solo or as a team in a variety of offline and online modes and compete against players from around the world. Build the ultimate machine to match your racing style, unlock special skills to gain the upper hand, and unleash power-up items for the win!”</em></p>

			<p>Developer<a href="https://x.com/mundfish/status/1931103250662707397"> Mundfish</a> has announced that Atomic Heart II is in development, and is targeting a launch on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>According to Summer Game Fest creator and host Geoff Keighley, this is a spiritual successor to the first game, and will focus more on RPG elements than the first did.</p>
<p>There's no word from Mundfish as to when it'll be ready. Today's announcement was just a trailer showing off what looks like a vastly expanded experience compared to what the first had, and that the game was in development.</p>
<p>Atomic Heart II was also not the only announcement Mundfish had for Summer Game Fest, as it also revealed a new title called <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/">The Cube.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Atomic Heart 2 - Announcement Trailer I SGF25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fquBSxalY1Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo liked the first game, but didn't feel like it hit the mark that the games it is inspired by did.</p>
<p>"<em>Atomic Heart is a solid debut for a brand-new</em> <em>developer</em>," <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/">he wrote</a>. "<em>Mundfish succeeded in following the example of BioShock to deliver an engaging first-person shooter that is fun to play (minus a few quirks), runs extremely well, and looks great. That said, the story is a letdown and should have been fleshed out more, just like the side content."</em></p>
<p>Hopefully the sequel is able to step it up.</p>

			<p>Code Vein II, the second entry in the hardcore action role-playing game series published by Bandai Namco, has been announced today with a new trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer, which was shown during this year's Summer Game Fest, provides a quick look at the game's dark setting, main characters, and the fearsome enemies they will have to face, which all feel in line with what we have seen in the original game released back in 2019. The trailer also confirmed the game will be launching in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><iframe title="CODE VEIN II — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdD6dEhhges?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In case you have never heard of the original Code Vein and want to get up to speed, you can learn more about it ahead of Code Vein II's release in 2026 by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>But despite its occasionally tedious locations, Code Vein does tap into the satisfaction that comes from exploration and conquest. With no real loading screens, you’ll want to keep pushing forward, testing your luck and hopefully pushing your sidekick off a skyscraper. The combat has a lot going on, even if most of the encounters start with the same type of ambush. Whether Code Vein can be remembered in the same way as Dragon's Dogma is yet to be seen, but its over the top edgy aesthetic and pretty decent combat make it fun enough to jump into.</em></p>

			<p>Mortal Shell 2 kicked off the Summer Game Fest 2025 showcase today, with an action-packed trailer showcasing the return of the Soulslike from indie developer Cold Symmetry and publisher PlayStack.</p>
<p>This sequel builds on the first game and according to a press release "<em>significantly expands on the original with unrestricted, adrenaline-charged combat, deeper weapon design with extensive upgrade options, and an emphasis on free exploration</em>."</p>
<p>Mortal Shell 2 continues with the same core mechanic that separated the first game from other Soulslikes, where you possess the shell of another to gain access to new ways of fighting and new abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Shell II - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0SLSLuYMhw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Cold Symmetry expanded combat and storytelling compared to the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-shell-indie-soulslike-game-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store/">Mortal Shell</a>. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto appreciated the different approach the first game had when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mortal-shell-ps4-shells-crack-twice/">reviewed it</a>, saying:</p>
<p>"<em>Mortal Shell is an interesting case where the Souls formula can be put to good use in an action RPG that doesn't need excessive padding or leveling to tell its story. While its incredibly short by Soulslikes standards, the unique defensive approaches to combat and the synergy of weapons/shells give Mortal Shell its own niche in the growing genre. At half the price of a traditional AAA adventure, Mortal Shell is certainly worth an impulse purchase for established fans of the hardcore action RPG genre.</em>"</p>
<p>The sequel will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026.</p>
