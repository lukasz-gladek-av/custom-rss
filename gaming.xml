            <p>Stab-o-sneak merchants Ubisoft are pushing back the release of several unspecified big name projects in the wake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which CEO Yves Guillemot says "has reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand". The tactical snoop 'n' shoot peddlers are also looking to cut costs by at least €100 million across their organisation, following a difficult year in which they've partnered with Tencent to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">launch a new corporate subsidiary</a> dedicated to their most popular games.</p><!--more-->
<p>"This year has been a challenging one for Ubisoft, with mixed dynamics across our portfolio, amid intense industry competition," observed Guillemot in <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">Ubi's latest earnings results</a>, adding that the company's overall earnings for the past year are "slightly below objective". He says they're in a strong position regardless thanks to the "discipline applied across the Group", which presumably includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">those mass layoffs in January</a>, amongst other cutbacks. According to the earnings call, Ubisoft have shrunk their staff headcount by "around 3,000" since the end of September 2022.</p>
<p>By "discipline", Guillemot is also probably referring to Ubisoft's repeated delaying of Assassin's Creed Shadows to ensure a more positive reception than that achieved by last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. He says the delay has paid off, with Shadows having the second highest launch day revenue of any game in the series. "The launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows was a defining moment," the Ubiboss continued. "It reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand, with a highly favourable community response from long-time fans and new players alike."</p>
<p>Guillemot says Ubisoft have completed their cost-cutting plans "ahead of schedule". Still, management remain focussed on "discipline", with plans for "additional savings of at least €100m over the next two years to drive structural efficiencies and reinforce the foundations of our organization". So, more job losses then?</p>
<p>Ubisoft are also still completing the creation of their new Tencent-backed subsidiary, which will oversee development of future Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six games. We can expect a "new organisation" to be announced later this year. The publishers have also "decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success", which means that "[Financial Year] 2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands."</p>
<p>The rest of Ubisoft's 2025 and early 2026 will look relatively trim by comparison. On PC, we can expect <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> and Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era, together with expansions for Assassin's Creed Shadows and, just possibly, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time remake</a>.</p>
<p>An accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/6pXJlDFC1Nrw8mwM4M8Nr8/d4036561f95076c3acdb1003819058ef/Ubisoft_FY25_Slideshow_vfinal.pdf">slideshow presentation</a> maintains Ubisoft's commitment to the two wolves that lurk inside every triple-A game company - "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> adventures" and "GaaS-native experiences", aka live service games. They want to both "improve the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences" and serve up "richer multiplayer features with more frequent content updates".</p>
<p>I don't see any mention here of "disciplining" executive salaries and compensation, but to give the Devil his due, Guillemot has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-is-taking-a-large-paycut">taken paycuts over poor company performance</a> in the past.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Following reports of a Steam data leak over the weekend, Valve has investigated the issue and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/533224478739530145?l=english">issued a statement</a> to firstly refute reports that this is a breach of their systems, and to reassure users that there is no need to change passwords or amend security settings.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">LinkedIn post</a> claimed that a trove of leaked data from Steam included over 89 million user records, but while this initially appeared concerning, fears were allayed somewhat when an update explained that this related to real-time TFA SMS logs – time-sensitive codes that are sent via text message for two factor authentication. This still suggested that a hacker had infiltrated the overarching security system, but had only gained “backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly.”</p>


<p>Valve has now issued a statement following their own analysis and confirmed that “was<strong> NOT</strong> a breach of Steam systems,” that details within the leak “did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data,”&nbsp;and that users “you do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event.”</p>
<p>What they do advise, however, is that users should set up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p>
<p>Using SMS messages for TFA is an outdated and less secure method of providing a time-sensitive code to users. SMS messages are not encrypted, so if a bad actor were able to intercept those authentication codes in time, they would be able to use them in conjunction with account details and passwords to gain access to an account.</p>

<p>Using an authenticator app with an automatically rotating and generated code from a secure key or that is reliant on encrypted push notifications is much more secure, as this requires access to a trusted device in addition to login and password. Furthermore, Steam now has a more automated login system where you can scan a QR code using the Steam Mobile Authenticator and not have to input account details at all.</p>
<p>Even with these security options, you do still need to be wary of unexpected emails and messages prompting you to login to personal accounts. There’s always more and more advanced attempts by naughty people to try and fool you into giving them your stuff.</p>
<p>But for now, if you’re happy and content with your Steam login set up, there’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Valve’s statement in full:</p>
<p><em>You may have seen reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined&nbsp;<b>this was NOT a breach of Steam systems.</b><wbr></em></p>

<p><em>We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.<wbr></em></p>

<p><em>The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. <b>The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data.</b> Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>You do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your Steam account security at any time at&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>

			<p>Following reports that Steam had suffered a security breach that might affect as many as 89 million users, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/533224478739530146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has set the record straight on the matter</a>, clarifying that the leak absolutely did not breach Steam systems, and users do not need to change their passwords.</p>
<p><em>We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was NOT a breach of Steam systems. We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.</em></p>

<p><em>We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account’s safety.</em></p>
<p>The reports began when a hacker known as Machine1337 or EnergyWeapon started advertising the sale of user records for Valve's platforms on the dark web. They were attempting to sell the data for $5K, but according to Valve, nothing malicious could be done with them anyway.</p>

            <p>
Epic Games has withdrawn its initial submission for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to return to the iPhone App Store in the US, after Apple failed to approve the game for launch this week. 
</p>
<p>
The Fortnite maker <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585">announced</a> last Friday, 9th May, that it had submitted Fortnite to Apple for review - a process that usually lasts just a day or two. Apple, however, doesn't appear to be in any hurry to see Fortnite return.
</p>
<p>
Now, due to the game's ever-updating nature, Epic has been forced to withdraw that submission and reapply using Fortnite's next game version - which had been due to go live on all platforms this morning, but has now been <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1922806111284924584">postponed</a> until tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
These developments follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">bombshell ruling of a US judge earlier this month</a> that blasted Apple for continuing to impede developers from offering their own in-app payment methods - the issue which kickstarted Fortnite's long-running feud with Apple and got the game booted from the App Store worldwide. Apple must now allow developers in the US to do this, the judge ruled - though the matter of approving individual apps is still at Apple's own discretion.
</p>
<p>
"No news from Apple yet," Epic Games boss <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922654805735952768">Tim Sweeney wrote on social media last night</a>. They've had it since last Friday. 
</p>
<p>
"We emailed yesterday but haven't heard back," he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922655523175862658">continued</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously," <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922724874264412295">Sweeney noted in another post</a>. "So we have pulled the previous Fortnite version submitted to Apple App Review last Friday, and we have submitted a new version for review."
</p>
<p>
After years of legal wrangling, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">Fortnite is back on the App Store in the European Union</a> - but currently nowhere else. Apple, meanwhile, has already filed to appeal the recent ruling over its US App Store.</p>

Friends, it is my sad duty to inform you that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/one-million-checkboxes">One Million Checkboxes</a> creator Neal Agarwal is up to more of his crowdgaming mischief. He’s published another online squabbling sim called Internet Roadtrip. It’s a roaming Google Streetview cam in which viewers vote on the direction of travel every 10 seconds. The thinking behind Saltybet applied to the experience of driving your kids to Disney Land, in short. It is possibly a commentary on self-piloting vehicles, but mostly, it is a celebration of the raucous magic of chatboxes. You can also vote to honk the horn.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
At the time of publication, the vehicle has travelled 573 miles and there are around 1000 drivers online. 1000 strangers, some of whom appear to be either pleasantly stoned or wildly over-caffeinated, screaming instructions at a phantom Tesla. Currently, we are coasting down Church Street in Gardiner, Maine, and there is a heated argument in chat about the politics of turning right or left of the church.</p>
<p>The leftists carry the debate, for once, and we sail down the highway past a crop of trees. #1 Eastern White Pine Fan takes a moment to grieve the plight of the majestic ash. “It’s so bittersweet,” they write. “i love them but they're almost all dead on the east coast now, since the emerald ash borer devastated all ash species native to north america.” Thank you, #1 Eastern White Pine Fan.
</p>
<p>
A contingent of viewers are obsessed with driving to Canada. “Can we get to Canada before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>,” asks user Crab, thus doing the SEO-minded news writers in the viewership a real solid. The Canada faction are opposed by a posse of staunch Agarwal fanbois who are hellbent on making the vehicle circle Neal Street forever.</p>
<p>User Pingu throws a spanner in the works by abruptly demanding that we head to Mexico. It’s clear that quite a lot of the commenters are locals. “EVERYBODY STAY ON 9,” insists Pothos, Leader Of The Pathists. Oh we’re on Maine Avenue now, crossing a bridge. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts. Can we stop for doughnuts? Alas no, but we can honk if we love doughnuts. Which we do.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/">Find Internet Roadtrip here</a>. It's free, but Agarwal is accepting donations by way of that clickable coffee cup. As is the way of anonymous communications platforms, the chat is probably going to become a trashfire at some stage. I sense that Agarwal has applied automatic filters for slurs and hate speech, but as we have found when moderating RPS comments, bigots can be creative. If you’re just here to settle back and enjoy the ambience of, right now, Cheney Road in Chelsea, Agarwal has considerately built in an FM radio. You have to vote to change the station, mind.

            <p>
Valve has responded to reports of an alleged "massive" Steam data leak, insisting none of its systems have been breached and no account, password, payment, or personal data has been stolen. It has, however, confirmed hackers accessed a number of "older text messages" containing limited information.
</p>
<p>
Unsubstantiated reports of a Steam data breach first surfaced over the weekend, when a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">widely shared LinkedIn post</a> claimed a "threat actor" had appeared on a "well-known dark web forum claiming to have breached Steam" and was "offering a dataset of over 89m user records" for $5K USD. A later update claimed the breach was related to "real-time [two-factor authentication] SMS logs", and that analysis of the leaked data suggested the hacker had gained "backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly."
</p>
<p>
Valve has now responded to those claims, saying it has "examined the leak sample and... determined this was <em>not</em> a breach of Steam systems." The leak specifically relates to "older text messages", it added, and Steam users "do not need to change [their] passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event."
</p>
<p>
"You may have seen reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers," the company wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/533224478739530145?l=english">full message shared on Steam</a>. "We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was <em>not</em> a breach of Steam systems. We're still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone."
</p>
<p>
"The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to," it continued. "The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages"
</p>
<p>
"You do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event," Valve added. "It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven't already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account's safety."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released fresh screenshots of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, giving us our first look at the game in three years.</p>
<p>The last time the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">shown was back in 2022 for the series' 20th anniversary</a>, revealing Sora's return and the expansive metropolis of Quadratum.</p>
<p>Now, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancellation of mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link yesterday</a>, Square Enix is appeasing fans with a handful of screenshots.</p>

<p>"We're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts 4 and will continue pouring ourselves into the game's development. We're dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations!" reads an official social media post.</p>
<p>"We've seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can't wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts 4 when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience."</p>
<p>The screenshots show Sora mid-battle in Quadratum against a handful of Heartless, as well as close-ups of some character models and moments in the city.</p>
<p>One screenshot suggests Mickey Mouse will be playable in this game. Disney's lead character has always been a part of the series and has previously been playable in a limited capacity, but his inclusion here hints at a bigger playable role this time around.</p>

<p>Perhaps what's most interesting is what isn't shown in these screenshots. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> games fuse together the worlds of Disney and Final Fantasy, but we're yet to see which Disney kingdoms will be featured in the new game, nor which Final Fantasy characters will make an appearance. I can certainly imagine Clive turning up at some point.</p>
<p>Also, where are longtime partners Donald and Goofy?</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts 4 remains without a release date, but it's been in development for quite some time. It's been six years since the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> on PS4 and Xbox One and fans are eagerly anticipating the next installment.</p>
<p>Last year, series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-will-lead-towards-a-series-conclusion-so-nomura-can-retire">Kingdom Hearts 4 will lead towards a series conclusion</a> as he looks to retire.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, during the company's quarterly financial report, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-development-3-year-reboot-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some Kingdom Hearts news. They confirmed that development on the fourth mainline installment was going forward, but they also canceled the spin-off Missing Link, which was targeting a release on mobile devices. The reason was that they could not offer a satisfactory live service over an extended period. The game's story would have been set in the Scala ad Caelum world between the events seen in Union X and Dark Road.</p>
<p>Of course, most fans are really interested in Kingdom Hearts IV. After all, it's been over three years since <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's announcement</a>. Thankfully, earlier today, the official X account of the series <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new message and screenshots.</p>
<p><em>To our Kingdom Hearts community,</em></p>
<p><em>We’re currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development. We’re dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations! We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support.</em></p>
<p>A few details of KHIV are already available. We know it's being made with Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and will be set in Quadratum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-original-sora-tokyo-no-twewy-ties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a city loosely inspired by Japan's Tokyo</a>, featuring fictional versions of Shibuya and Minami-Aoyama. Quadratum will function as the game's hub world, while Sora and his allies travel to other worlds for the missions. Story-wise, Kingdom Hearts IV will introduce the brand new 'Lost Master' story arc.</p>
<p>When it comes to gameplay, the game will bring back the reaction commands seen in KHII while also using a 'Scrap and Build' mechanic. Nomura-san and his team also plan to show off more of Sora's daily life and routines.</p>

It will launch on November 13. <span id="more-965120"></span></p><p>In Japan, the physical edition for Switch will be priced at 7,480 yen (8,228 yen with tax), and includes a limited edition “<em>Beyblade X</em> CX-00 Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.” Pricing for the digital version has yet to be announced.</p><p>While a western release was not officially announced, <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> previously had a surprise day-date-date English release alongside its Japanese debut.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via FuRyu:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> is a “Beyblade <a title="Genres > Action [2,723 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a>” based on the fourth generation of the <em>Beyblade</em> franchise, <em>Beyblade X</em>. By battling and customizing Beyblades, players can experience the excitement of actual bey battles in a form only a game can offer. This time, three further evolutions have been added.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features (Evolutions)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>EVOBATLE</strong> – <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> was well-received for its “X (Extreme) Dash” and tactical yet action-packed bey battles in “X (Extreme) Line”-equipped stadiums. In <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>, tactics and methods of attack and defense vary significantly depending on actual type affinities and characteristics, evolving into “ultra high-speed action” where instant command actions are the key to victory. Players can continue to battle online against bladers from around the world and challenge each other for the top spot.</li><li><strong>EVOSTORY</strong> – In single-player mode, players can enjoy an all-new original story featuring new characters such as Tenka Shiroboshi (voiced by Yuko Natsuyoshi), who has joined the protagonist’s team in the <em>Beyblade X</em> anime, along with a cast of unique, game-original characters. Compete with new allies and aim for victory in the “Bey <a title="Genres > Battle Royale [48 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/battle-royale">Battle Royale</a>.”</li><li><strong>EVOCUSTOMIZATION</strong> – In 2025, <em>Beyblade X</em> introduces the “CX (Custom Line),” expanding the possibilities for customization. In <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>, players can enjoy this wider range of customization, as well as collect materials to coat their Beyblades in their favorite colors. Build a one-of-a-kind Beyblade to stand out from your rivals.</li></ul><p><strong>Save Data Bonus</strong></p><p>Players with save data from <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> will receive “reward money” in <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> based on their game progress. Use reward money to enhance your beys or buy your favorites in the shop. Additionally, players who purchased paid digital boosters can also carry over the “blades” of Beyblades they previously obtained into <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>.</p><p><strong>Bundle Bonus: Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.</strong></p><p>All physical editions of <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> will include an actual “<em>Beyblade X</em> CX-00 Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.” This is a new model in a limited edition color only available by purchasing the physical edition of the game.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a teaser trailer and video for the bundle bonus below.</p><h2><span>Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="『ベイブレードエックス エボバトル』ティザームービー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvigSv1NauM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.</span></h2><p><iframe title="【ベイブレード開発者レビュー】レオンファングT4-60A レッドVer.【ベイブレードエックス エボバトル特典】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIyxpYkYMdA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/kingdom-hearts-iv-development-update-new-screenshots-released-by-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Following its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer">announcement in 2022</a>, official updates for Kingdom Hearts IV have been few and far between. Though franchise fans are no strangers to waiting for information and, subsequently, game launches, Square Enix wanted to update fans on how development is progressing and provide a few new screenshots.</p><p>The update came via the official Kingdom Hearts X accounts. Both the <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436">English</a> and <a href="https://x.com/_KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819279990251633">Japanese</a> accounts shared multiple screenshots combined into one image. The smaller screenshots are the same, but the large header screenshots differ depending on the account.</p>

</article>
<p>The screenshots were accompanied by a message from the development team. "To our Kingdom Hearts community," the post reads, "We're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game's development. We're dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations!"</p><p>"We've seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts," the account continues in <a href="https://x.com/kingdomhearts/status/1922819245030899902?s=46&amp;t=NQuiqRa_BGRV8b-BEm-aYw">a subsequent post</a>. "We are equally excited and can't wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support."</p><p>While the large screenshots are action shots of Sora in combat, the smaller visuals released by the Kingdom Hearts team tonight feature what appear to be cinematics and an enemy. However, one intriguing screen seems to indicate that Mickey could be playable, unless it's just an unconventional camera angle.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>EA is asking employees to return to the office for three days per week under a hybrid model – and it sounds like the company will be significantly reducing remote hiring. CEO Andrew Wilson and president of EA Entertainment and technology Laura Miele sent emails to staff about the change, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. <em>Kotaku’s</em> Ethan Gach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667401/eas-ceo-is-asking-staff-to-return-to-the-office">also reported</a> on Wilson’s email.</p><p>Corporate communications VP Justin Higgs confirmed the new hybrid model to <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve adopted a globally consistent hybrid work model to bring teams together with greater clarity and intent – enabling faster decisions, sharper execution, and stronger connection to one another,” Higgs says. Hybrid roles will spend “at least three days a week in the office,” though there will be “flexibility” on other roles.</p><p>Miele’s email details how EA locations will have a 30-mile radius around them to help determine if an employee falls under the on site, hybrid, or remote model for work, IGN reports. Here’s what Miele says, per <em>IGN</em>:</p><div><ul><li><span>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</span></li><li><span>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</span></li></ul></div><p>The “offsite local” work model is going to be sunset within 3 to 24 months. In addition, “any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s /my approval,” Miele’s email says, according to IGN.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 14th</strong>: Noted that Ethan Gach also reported on Wilson’s email.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Company moves to "globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Electronic Arts has announced to employees that it will be ending its remote working policies permanently, and implementing a full return to office.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email sent to employees today viewed by IGN, CEO Andrew Wilson said that in-person work results in "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players." He then went on to broadly outline that "hybrid work" would now be defined as a "minimum of three days a week in your local office," and that "offsite local roles" would be gradually phased out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up email from EA Entertainment president, Laura Miele, also viewed by IGN, she clarified further details, describing the company as moving from "a decentralized approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model":</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>These changes will not take effect immediately. Employees should continue working as directed by your Business Unit until further notice, regardless of where you live.</em></li><li><em>Work model transitions will come with a minimum 12-week notice period before any changes are implemented. The timing will vary by location and will be communicated locally with plenty of notice.</em></li><li><em>Hybrid work will mean working from your local office at least three days per week–this aligns with what’s outlined in Andrew’s EA Action. </em></li><li><em>We are introducing a new 30-mile/48-km radius around EA locations.</em></li><li><em>What this means:</em><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model. </em></li><li><em>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</em></li></ul></li><li><em>We will also sunset the Offsite Local work model. Depending on your location, this transition may take 3 to 24 months.</em></li><li><em>Any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s /my approval. </em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Several sources within EA speaking to IGN anonymously said that employees were upset and confused, with some employees sharing hours-long commutes they were now being expected to make, or expressing concerns regarding childcare or personal medical conditions that had benefited from remote work. Others, classified as remote and outside the 30-mile range, expressed concern for what would happen to their roles if they were unwilling or unable to move closer to an office long-term. Two sources explained to IGN that per the breakdown sent by Miele, existing remote workers would have their "exemptions" to return to office "sunset" sometime in the next 3 to 24 months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While remote work has long been prevalent in the video game industry, it became exceptionally popular during and after the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, when stay-at-home mandates forced most AAA companies to adapt remote work as a long-term solution. In the years since, more and more companies have hired more and more remote workers, and existing near-office workers have reported moving to cheaper cities away from offices, under the impression that remote work was permanent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, other major video game companies have recently been calling workers back to office, resulting in frustration and, at times, employee turnover as workers were forced to choose between expensive or challenging relocation and their jobs. Companies such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns">Rockstar Games</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-montreal-in-turmoil-amid-what-developers-are-calling-broken-promises">Ubisoft</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-protest-new-office-mandate-calling-it-a-soft-layoff">Activision</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-producer-claims-studio-is-creating-crisis-maps-as-more-employees-depart">Blizzard</a> have all faced criticism from within and without as a result of these policies. However, the return to office mandates have appeared to move apace, with more companies such as EA opting to require an in-office model once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">laid off around 300 individuals company-wide</a>, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">earlier layoffs at BioWare this year</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">termination of around 670 roles last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to EA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.”</p><p>Valve adds that you don’t need to change your password or phone number following this leak, though it does recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p><p>The company says it’s “still digging into the source of the leak.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The open-world wizarding adventure Hogwarts Legacy is getting a Switch 2 release, and it's one of the console's launch games on June 5.

However, it makes a few big upgrades thanks to the additional processing power on Switch 2. For one, it offers improved graphics and shorter load times. You’ll also benefit from crisper audio, reworked controls, and support for the Joy-Con 2 mouse sensor.</span></p>                      </div><p>Note that Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 comes on a Game-Key Card, which means none of the game data is on the cartridge itself, and instead it acts as physical DRM that unlocks the digital version. You'll need to download the game to your console before you can play.</p><p>As mentioned above, players who already own Hogwarts Legacy on Switch can upgrade for just $10. That means it might be worth hunting down a cheap copy of Hogwarts Legacy on Switch ahead of time, then dropping an additional $10 to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. If you want to go that route, Hogwarts Legacy is on sale for just $18 (was $60) on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hogwarts-legacy-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch eShop</a>. Once it’s in your library, you’ll be able to upgrade to a Switch 2 copy for an extra $10--meaning you'll pay just $28 total, rather than $60.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy takes place well before the events of Harry Potter. It sees you creating your own character and enrolling in Hogwarts. You’ll learn a variety of useful spells during your adventure, as you set out to discover a secret regarding ancient magic and a dangerous dragon. It earned positive reviews from critics and fans, and it looks like this jump to Switch 2 will be another chance for folks to live out their wizarding dreams.

Interactive Entertainment. Prior to the game's initial 2023 launch, Hogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling.

Nintendo has recently shared that players can customize these buttons to map to specific actions on a per-game basis.</p><p>In an overview posted on the Nintendo Today app, the company explained that the new buttons are fully mappable by the player. This means that they can take on the role of any other button on the controller. Moreover, these mappings can be set for each game, meaning that you'll have the ability to set up game-specific controller settings.</p>
