            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the curious things you will stumble across early on when playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is a lifeless scout bot crumpled to the floor. What does it do? Can it be revived? Where are there more of them? That’s what we’ll set out to answer in this quick guide</p>
<h2>What do Scout Bots do in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Scout Bots are, to put it simply, item locators. Once activated, they will spring into action, marking all of the remaining items within a region on your map for you, so that you can fully power up Samus.</p>
<h2>How can you activate Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Activating a Scout Bot needs you to shoot it with some electrical juice to power it up. This means you need a lightning gun, which is one of the later unlocks for Samus’ new suit of armour in Metroid Prime 4. This is very much a late-game kind utility, for when players have the majority of Samus’ abilities and can actually reach and grab almost all of the items that a Scout Bot will locate.</p>


<h2>Where are all of the Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>There is one Scout Bot located in each region on Viewros, and if you’re attentive as you explore each location, chances are you’ll find all of the Scout Bots. You can make a note of which room and general area they are in using markers on the map (or by making a written note). Or… well, here’s where they all are:</p>
<h3>Fury Green</h3>
<p>Right near the start of the area, you’ll find the Scout Bot in the room branching off from the main path. You really can’t miss it… but you might forget exactly where to go by the time you can activate it!</p>


		
		

<h3>Volt Forge</h3>
<p>The Scout Bot in Volt Forge is tucked a little out of the way down on the side platform of the second generator. That could be quite a chore to get back to, but it’s much easier later in the game.</p>
<p>From the entrance area of Tower 1, head to the elevator opposite the Save Station room. Instead of taking the elevator, scan for a pipe on the right side of the room, which you can rip open using the Psychic Lasso. Hop in as a Morph Ball and this takes you down to the side of the generator of Tower 1.</p>
<p>Use the Psychic Grapple to swing across to the main platform of Tower 1’s Generator, then head straight over to the other side platform and scan for a Psychic Boost Rail. Roll in with the Morph Ball and boost to shoot yourself across to Tower 2’s Generator. Battle the robots here and on the other side platform you will find your Scout Bot. Also… there’s maybe an item near here!</p>

		
		

<h2>Ice Belt</h2>
<p>This one’s super simple. The Scout Bot is off to the side of the frozen wasteland where you have the battle with the pack of wolves. Return here and look to the right and side as you come down the slope to see it.</p>

<h2>Flare Pool</h2>
<p>Another easy to reach one. Drive through the opening area of Flare Pool to reach the shut down bridge and river of lava that you had to cross to reach the main facility. Bike across the lava and head to the right hand side of the maintenance grate. Hop over the bollards and you’ll find the scout bot and a little puzzle to complete once you’ve unlocked the Morph Ball tether.</p>

		
		

<h2>Sol Valley</h2>
<p>Sol Valley’s Scout Bot is pretty handy, given just how big and open space it is! You’ll actually be able to reach the Scout Bot right from where you first land in this region. If you’re coming out of Volt Forge, turn left after exiting the structure and you should see an island just detached from the cliff edge to the world. Activate some Psychic Platforms to jump across and you’ll find the Scout Bot here.</p>

		
		

<h2>Great Mines</h2>
<p>And finally, the Great Mines. I’ll keep things pretty light here, as we’re getting towards the end of the game. See a big spiky green thing? It’s to the left.</p>

		
		

<p>And that’s all of them! With the Scout Bots collected, you’ve still got time for hunting down all the remaining items you have to get Samus fully kitted out for the game’s grand finale. Good luck with that!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horses Is Tame]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/</link>
            <guid>1373284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>While playing <em>Horses</em>, I was filled with dread for a revelation that never came. “This is creepy,” I thought, “but surely there’s some big thing in the next scene that pushes the envelope too far.” Yet despite the drama, I am here to tell you that <em>Horses</em>, the cause célèbre from Italian developer Santa Ragione that has now been prevented from being sold on <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>Steam</u></a> and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic Store</u></a> and was <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-santa-ragione-delisted-relisted-epic-steam/"><u>temporarily delisted from the Humble Store</u></a>, isn’t that troubling. Yes, it contains disturbing scenes of sexual violence and abuse, but so do many great works of art. The acts themselves are cartoonish, goofy, and self-censored. If this is what’s considered the limit for which games can and cannot be sold on mass marketplaces, then we’re all in trouble and everyone involved in that decision should be thoroughly embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Note: The following features images and plot details from the game <em>Horses</em> which some people may find disturbing.</strong> </p><h2 id="high-horse"><strong>High horse</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>In <em>Horses</em>, you play a 20 year old man named Anselmo who has been sent by his parents to work on a farm for the summer. The game is entirely in 4:3 black and white, and the sound of a film projector is heard in the background constantly, with speech rendered in text cards like a silent film. The farmer shows you around and introduces you to his livestock: a pen of “horses” that are actually just naked (yet blurred-out) people in horse masks. “These are my horses, they’re my pride and joy,” he says in subtitled Italian. You then proceed to get on a horse piggyback style and do a goofy jumping mini game while a player piano noodles in the background.</p><figure><figcaption><span>There's a lot of weird dinners with mouth noises, but the game provides a Misophonia warning at the beginning. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the game goes on you are instructed to do various errands around the farm (water the plants, chop wood, feed the “dog”) as revelations about the nature of the horses reveal themselves. The farmer tells you that fornication between horses is forbidden, and that you must report any horses that you catch in the act. You come to learn precisely why the horses are like that, what motivates the farmer, and witness various acts of punishment and sexual violence. Importantly, these acts are rarely shown explicitly; all nudity is censored, and much of what is done is occluded in a stylized way. It’s easy to draw immediate thematic parallels to Ionesco’s <em>Rhinoceros</em> or Peter Shaffer’s <em>Equus,</em> although the most obvious comparison is Pasolini’s <em>Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom</em>. Both are deeply Italian works about power, the body, and sexuality, although <em>Horses</em> is censored, does not feature real people, carries far less baggage, and is nowhere near as complex by comparison.</p><figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtkbDNNrFoY&amp;list=RDWtkbDNNrFoY&amp;start_radio=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"></a><figcaption><a href="https://youtu.be/WtkbDNNrFoY?si=AjzN9YULjy63DGUu&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>The farm</span></a><span>. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Horses</em> is a sophomoric game in both good and bad ways. The sex acts themselves often feel like the Unity asset version of two naked dolls being slapped together. Often this is funny, and the game can carry an absurd, cartoonish delivery that feels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distancing_effect?ref=aftermath.site"><u>intentionally alienating</u></a>. It is a cumbersome game to play, deliberately slow in the way that artful indie games tend to be. Its message and metaphors about sex and repression land with the subtlety of a brick, which I find a little charming in an Italian, absurdist way. But these scenes can overstay their welcome, and the symbolism feels, appropriately, a little tortured.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The broken man. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are moments of grief and loneliness I find genuinely striking in <em>Horses</em>. There is a scene of a gelded horse man on his knees in a field, his mask’s eyes dead and his will to live severed from him. He is broken. And yet there are other times where I found myself saying “I get it” as the various tasks take forever and their intent is obvious. Yet despite being long in the tooth at times, the message of <em>Horses </em>does land and is immediately parsable by anybody with a passing familiarity with any art form that isn’t video games. It’s a message that resonates far louder given that Valve and Epic seem terrified and deeply confused by a work that could not be any clearer if it tried.</p><h2 id="what-the-hay"><strong>What the Hay?</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>I don't think you can pet the "dog." Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>In different circumstances I do not think <em>Horses</em> would be controversial, a game mainly noteworthy among people who like intentionally unpleasant art horror games. To play it after all this is deflating; so much controversy over…this? This makes its de facto ban confusing, damning, and downright weird — it constantly feels like there’s a part of the story not being shared. I’ll concede that it is understandable that a game with this content would trigger alarm bells. Santa Ragione speculated that a scene in an early build where a “young girl” rides the shoulders of one of the horses may have led to Valve<a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> rejecting the game in 2023</u></a>. But they also claimed that they aged the girl up to an unambiguously grown woman and found it to work better in the context of the game – a point I agree with having actually played it and seen the content of the scene.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The scene in the final game. You walk a woman through a pen on a person's shoulders while she talks to you. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>The doubling down from Valve without any specificity or opportunity for appeal is damning enough, but the sudden 11th hour banning on the part of Epic raises eyebrows even further (Santa Ragione <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too?ref=aftermath.site"><u>says</u></a> the Humble delisting was temporary so the storefront could “reevaluate” the game.) Scandal sells, and this is great marketing on Santa Ragione’s part, or it would be if the way that PC games are sold was not <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>functionally oligopolistic</u></a> (although you can still buy the game on GoG, Humble and Itch). You need only play the game or watch a playthrough to realize just how embarrassing it is that this game has been made a pariah. This is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irr%C3%A9versible?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Irréversible</em></a>. But regardless of how you feel about <em>Horses</em>, it is undeniable that it has become an important work merely by existing and being deemed deviant.</p><p>Both Valve and Epic have been vague and contradictory about what triggered the bans, with the latter pointing to <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines?ref=aftermath.site"><u>policies</u></a> around “explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated” and a “‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy” that prohibits abuse of humans or animals. This can only be read as nonsensical ass covering, particularly in the light of Epic seemingly reapplying for the game’s IARC rating last minute, which is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolecarpenter.bsky.social/post/3m73wyv6tw225?ref=aftermath.site"><u>by all accounts</u></a> objectively weird behavior.</p><p>If the invalidating content was slavery, then <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Final Fantasy XVI</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fallout-new-vegas--ultimate-edition?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fallout: New Vegas</u></em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-origins-ultimate-edition-ca4fbf?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dragon Age: Origins</u></em></a> would never be allowed to be sold. If torture is unallowed, then <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/grand-theft-auto-v?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>GTA V</u></em></a><em> </em>violates Epic’s terms of service with “By The Book,” a mission where Trevor tortures a guy by pulling his teeth out with pliers and electrocuting his nipples on behalf of the government. Americans understand and respect graphic violence, torture, and abuse as art, and on that front <em>Horses </em>is far less graphic than any 30 seconds in a recent <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mortal-kombat-1?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Mortal Kombat</u></em></a><em> </em>game<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>And even if we were to limit this to the topic of sexuality, you do not have to go too far on Steam to find far more depraved games that Valve is fine with publishing. Hell, if we were to narrowly limit our criteria to the specific topic of uncensored half-equine hybrid penis, one of my favorite games of the year, <a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange/"><em><u>Baby Steps</u></em></a><em>,</em> clears <em>Horses</em> easily and can be bought on Steam and PSN.</p><p>What this underscores is the sheer danger of market consolidation in gaming. While companies like Valve and Epic do not legally have to carry a game, to not do so is functionally a death knell for that game on the PC; Santa Ragione has <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said</u></a> it threatens the studio’s continued existence. This is not equivalent to a theater chain declining to carry a movie; this is two (mostly one) American companies more or less deciding what content is commercially viable across most of the world, in ways that are somehow more vague and opaque than the MPAA. This is a hegemony of American prudishness, applied globally, incoherently, unevenly, and unseriously. Anybody responsible for these decisions would be vaporized in seconds by a Pinku movie from the 1970s, and if a single person in this chain of command has an arts degree they are pretending they don’t for the sake of an ill-defined idea of business. <em>Horses </em>cannot be the ceiling for what is artistically and commercially possible in games, because otherwise we are in deep horseshit.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Va5_rn3vG3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Krusty the clown - What the hell was that?"></iframe></figure><h2 id="broken-horses"><strong>Broken horses</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The scene where the woman tells you in no uncertain terms what the game is about. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite my minor issues with the game, I want to talk about a scene in <em>Horses</em> that I love. It is the scene that Santa Ragione speculated may have caused this controversy, the one with the “young girl” that changed during development. Despite its reputation, it is not actually a scene about sex, but rather one about money, deviancy, and power. As you guide the daughter of a businessman riding horsepersonback she makes explicit what is often implicit in life.</p><p>“I know what you're thinking. I know these aren't real horses. But...you know, the way they used to live...A lot of people find that unacceptable. I don't care, personally. But usually, people exhibiting immoral behavior also have dangerous ideas. Like my dad always says, each of us is a cog in the machine; we must all do our duty so society can function properly. So dangerous ideas are a concern for everyone. Because if the machine jams, everything falls apart. And we can't allow that to happen! The farmer... He does what he does. And my father...Well, my father makes sure that his business opportunities keep growing. It's simple: In this world, on this farm...everyone who lives their life recklessly and indulgently ends up exactly where they deserve. Do you know what I mean?”</p><p>I cannot claim to know the minds of the people who shot down <em>Horses</em>, but the vagueness and hypocritical nature of their responses point to an unspoken rule: Art that is deemed a liability to business must be avoided without question. Gaming is often many things, but its status as gambling and toys take higher precedent than its ambition as an art form. How these decisions are made is arbitrary and capricious with supposedly immutable guidelines that can, somehow, change in a heartbeat for the right game.&nbsp;</p><p>A private company pulling a game from distribution the day before it was set to be released is a punishment for being “reckless and indulgent”--not censorship, in their own telling, but a game maker ending up “where they deserve.” Banning <em>Horses </em>is an exercise in power, and to quote Pier Paolo Pasolini: “Power can essentially do what it wants, and what it wants is completely arbitrary, or dictated by economic needs that elude common logic.”</p>

            <guid>1373275</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="35655e5426fe6"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35655e5426fe6/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>While the Switch and Switch 2 are portable systems that come with their own built-in screens, I've often been drawn to pairing Nintendo's hybrid consoles with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch">portable monitors</a> when I'm on the road and away from my TV.</p>
<p>One of my favourite choices for the original Switch is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#the-premium-choice-espressodisplay-v2">Espresso V2</a>, a premium 1080p screen which doesn't even need the dock – you can connect the console via a USB-C cable and power the screen using another USB-C-based power brick.</p>
<p>You can imagine, then, how excited I was when Espresso Displays offered to send out the 4K version of their screen to test with the Switch 2. <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-pro?variant=47210169860328">The £650 Espresso Pro 15</a> boasts a 15.6-inch, 60Hz LCD panel capable of displaying 1.07 billion colours and weighs 800 grams. With its anodised aluminium casing and super-tough glass front, it's the kind of screen I can see myself taking on the road with me – but there's one big drawback.</p>

<p>It seems that Nintendo has changed the way the Switch 2 outputs video through its USB-C ports, so you need the dock to run it on external displays like this – and that means using Espresso's own HDMI-to-USB-C cable, <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/hdmi?variant=46000850272488">which comes at an extra cost of £60</a>.</p>
<p>Even then, there are issues. Espesso's aforementioned cable has an extra USB-A cable built in for additional power to turn on the screen, but this cable isn't physically long enough to reach the USB-C port on the Switch 2 dock.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to place the dock next to a wall socket so I could plug in a USB power brick to juice up the screen. Alas, even this isn't enough to bring the display to life, so <em>another</em> USB-C power supply was required, plugged directly into the Espresso Pro 15's second USB-C port.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Espresso V2 required a similar setup (both of its USB-C ports were occupied), but the need to use the dock and an extra power supply for the HDMI cable is somewhat inconvenient.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the fact that the Espresso Pro 15 isn't using an OLED panel is a disappointment, as the difference is definitely noticeable; while the LCD screen seen here is bright, it lacks the punch of other displays I've used, such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#when-1080p-just-doesnt-cut-it-innocn-pu15-pre-15-6-4k-oled-monitor">INNOCN PU15-PRE</a> (which is also 4K).</p>
<figure data-uuid="f56ae2becb514"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f56ae2becb514/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a shame, because the bundled <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-stand-plus?variant=46757226938600">Espresso Stand+</a> makes this even more appealing for gamers. Using powerful neodymium magnets, the screen bolts onto the stand with ease, and even allows you to spin the display 90 degrees for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tate-mode-nintendo-switch-games">TATE-mode shmup action</a>. The Stand+ is adjustable and comes with two height settings, making it quite versatile.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that I used the Espresso Pro 15 from a gamer's point of view. However, its maker describes it as a screen aimed at professionals, and it's certainly more successful when viewed from that perspective. It can be powered using a single USB-C cable, which also connects to your Mac or PC and turns it into a second display, complete with touch support. That's a far more elegant solution than having to use a dock and two power supplies, as is the case when playing on it with a Switch 2.</p>
<p>With its lofty price tag and dependence on an additional extra in the shape of a specialised HDMI cable, it's hard to recommend the Espresso Pro 15 if you're <em>solely</em> looking for a portable gaming screen to use with your Switch 2 – but if you in the market for one that can double as a work monitor <em>and</em> a gaming one, then it might be worth a look.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/</link>
            <guid>1373269</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLDUmptln8&amp;pp=2AYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase</a> dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the franchise, Creative Assembly announced that Total War: Medieval III is now in early development.</p>



<p>In the official announcement article, the developers position the game as a return to a grounded, systems-driven historical Total War, with a heavy focus on politics, religion, and feudal power structures, rather than just map-painting conquest and a focus on medieval Europe and its neighboring regions, rather than a globe-spanning map. </p>



<p>The game is being developed with the next-generation Warcore engine, an evolution of the Total War engine intended to power future titles and support both PC and consoles. The team confirmed plans to bring Total War experiences to PlayStation and Xbox using this technology, while emphasizing that high-end PC strategy remains the priority and that the series will stay at the forefront of large-scale battles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Total War: Medieval III was undoubtedly the showcase's highlight, there was plenty more, starting with the availability of the premium <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER III</a> DLC Tides of Torment, which adds three new Legendary Lords to the High Elves, Norsca, and Slaanesh races. Furthermore, the stream unveiled the upcoming Lords of The End Times Pack, which will unleash four new Legendary Lords into the colossal Immortal Empires campaign (which, by the way, is now available for free to <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-review-monsters-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER I</a> &amp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-ii-its-bloody-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: WARHAMMER II</a> players) experience in Summer 2026. The first to be revealed is none other than the great necromancer, Nagash, who returns to reclaim his lost power and drown the world in undeath.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>These new lords also herald the arrival of the free End Times Update. Drawing inspiration from the lore, players will embark on a campaign experience transformed, featuring apocalyptic scenarios and cataclysmic events that push the boundaries of strategy and survival. And to crown this update, a new Legendary Lord will rise, ready to leave their mark on the cataclysm to come.</p>



<p>Today's announcements aren't everything. There's an unannounced Total War project that will be fully revealed at The Game Awards in a week from today. Creative Assembly described this as the next major release in one of the most ambitious games in Total War's entire history, framing it as the start of the franchise's exciting new era.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a> is in early pre-production, Creative Assembly have revealed during Total War's 25th anniversary showcase, with release still years away. It's to be the "rebirth of historical Total War", and CA are unveiling it earlier than they've ever announced a Total War game before, so that you crafty peasants can offer more feedback throughout development.</p>
<p>Time to hang up your Reikland Runefang and start boning up on the fall of the Byzantines - though there's precious little news about how the new Twar will differ in practice from Medieval 2, which launched way back in 2006. Here's a live action trailer full of moody-looking regents, some of whom are badly in need of a sticking plaster.

<p>
During the showcase stream, there was much loose historical background and talk of reinventing the wheel (which may have happened several times during the medieval era - enlighten me, historians?) but few concrete specifics. They don't even have a fixed start date for the period, though it sounds like it'll be approximately 12th to 15th century.</p><p>If I'm reading the entrails correctly, the game's world will range from the Holy Roman Empire through the Kingdom of England to the Italian Free States, the Mongols and the Ottomans. It will feature such celebs as Saladin, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and Richard the Lionheart.
</p>
<p>
The devs characterised the medieval period as one of experimentation, personal ambition, and the formation of nations. There was an aside on "lines of succession", which suggests you might be switching between rulers and their heirs, but colour that speculation. There was also a bit of detail on recruitment and historical armies, with a senior game designer commenting that rather than having a standing army, you might call on oaths of fealty to rally the banners of your vassals. 
</p>
<p>As divulged on <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii">the official website</a>, Medieval 3 will run on Warcore, Creative Assembly's new engine tech. It's billed as "unlike anything we’ve worked with before, offering a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks - all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve." Given how long Creative Assembly have been working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a>, it's nice to hear that there's a more comprehensive technological overhaul in the offing. </p>
<p>
I'll be honest, Medieval is one of the Twars I skipped. I am Shogun and Three Kingdoms to the bone. Still, I'm delighted for you fans of knights and castles. If you're baying for more, please direct your baying at <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii">this announcement post</a> from Medieval 3 creative director Leif Walter. It contains a lot of blue sky thinking, but there are some possibly indicative remarks about letting players deviate from the textbooks and your realm being "really almost like the main character in an RPG game".
</p><p>
That's not all Creative Assembly announced in their showcase. Not all they teased, rather. They've got another game reveal next week, during the Geoff Awards. Apparently, "this title will be Total War's next major release and represents one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history, marking the beginning of an exciting new era." Are the words "for the Emperor" stomping with zealous indignation towards this sentence, CA?
</p>
<p>
If all of this has you classique Warhammer advocates boarding your griffins and fleeing to the mountains, come back. There's more Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC on the way - Lords of the End Times, which introduces uber-necromancer Nagash and three other legendary lords. We'll try to write about that when we can. I have to go read up on Eleanor of Aquitaine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 goes live on Tuesday, meaning that there’s a large update for all players to download in order to get back in the game.</p>



<p>While many have been able to download the large update with no issue, there have been many others reporting issues with getting the latest content.</p>



<p>First mentioned by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1996629708621148440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, users are reporting that they are stuck in an “update available” loop. It’s not all platforms, but one that’s known to have an issue is Battle.net</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime, up until this week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, at least, is mostly free of spoken dialogue — especially when it comes to its mute protagonist, Samus Aran. But an unused monologue was recorded for the original Metroid Prime, and eventually uncovered by fans, with its performer remaining unknown. Until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently sat down with legendary Mass Effect and Metal Gear Solid (among many, many others) voice actress, Jennifer Hale, who provided the voice for Samus — entirely grunts and effort sounds — in the original Metroid Prime trilogy. While we were talking with her (and before it was confirmed she had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-replaced-samus-voice-actor-for-metroid-prime-4-so-its-no-longer-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-doing-the-grunts"><u>been replaced for 2025’s Metroid Prime 4</u></a>) we thought we’d get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding who voiced that once-lost voice-over that was left on the cutting room floor. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That monologue goes as follows, for those who are unfamiliar:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“Ten years ago, below the surface of planet Zebes, the mercenaries known as Space Pirates were defeated by interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran. Descending to the very core of the Pirate stronghold, Samus exterminated the energy-based parasites called Metroids, and defeated Mother Brain, the leader of the Pirate horde. But the' Space Pirates were far from finished. Several Pirate research vessels were orbiting Zebes while Samus fought on the surface below. After the fall of Mother Brain, the ships escaped, with the hopes of finding enough resources to rebuild their forces, and take their revenge. After discovering a possible Pirate colony on planet Tallon IV, Samus has again prepared for war, hoping to end the Pirate threat forever.”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Hale being the most famous voice of Samus, you’d perhaps assume she also recorded these introductory lines to the world of Prime. Well, you’d be wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's Vanessa. Vanessa Marshall," Hale reveals. It's perhaps not a surprise, as Marshall is already credited with also lending her talents to the voice of Samus in Metroid Prime, notably contributing her death scream to the sound library. Marshall also starred alongside Hale in Marvel’s Midnight Suns, as well as Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty as Olga, and may be familiar to fans of animated TV as the voice of Hera Syndulla in Star Wars' Rebels and Bad Batch series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to why Retro Studios and Nintendo went with Marshall over Hale for this prospective monologue, only to then ditch it anyway, Hale says she's unsure. “I adore Vanessa,” Hale adds. “I love that we actually shared this role. It's so crazy, and I'm not sure why. I never remember saying no to this. I would never have said no to doing this. They may have preferred her work. I have no idea.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not getting to record these fully formed sentences, Hale did get the lion's share of the grunt work on Metroid Prime. It sounds an intriguing process, which she went on to explain in more detail:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I like to have identified a character's way of speaking before I do grunting for them, because how you grunt is different to how I grunt, to how anyone else grunts," Hale explained. "It's very specific. If you are a civilian and you're grunting, you're like... [makes surprised grunt noise] because it's all surprising and it's all new. If you've done it a million times, you're like [makes short grunt noise], because you've gone under fire 1,800 times and you're used to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that once-lost intro narration was never used in the original Metroid Prime, parts of the monologue would later see the light of day, thanks to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Jay Ward, who voiced Star Fox’s Wolf O’Donnell in the Nintendo fighting game series, rerecorded certain lines of it that were laid under the Opening/Menu - Metroid Prime track on the soundtrack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Who knows where this monologue will turn up next, or why it was never actually used in the final game. At least for now, thanks to Samus herself, part of this mystery has been solved. Would you have liked the intro narration to have been kept? Although I do love the lonely, wordless nature of Metroid Prime, I do like the “Ripley at the end of Alien” feel this gives to the game.

            <p>Three Fields Entertainment, developers of Burnout with sky roads racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckreation">Wreckreation</a>, have announced that their entire team have been put on notice of redundancy. According to the announcement from CEO and former Criterion studio director Fiona Sperry, this comes as Three Fields find themselves without backing from Wreckreation publishers THQNordic, having "had to self-fund most of this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful," Sperry wrote in a message shared via the game's Twitter account.</p>
<p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for all of us," she continued. "What makes it even harder is that we have so many things in the pipeline — multiple features, updates, and creative ideas that we were excited to bring to the game, many of which are showcased in the video we’re sharing today."</p>
<p>Said video, which you can watch via the tweet above, shows off a number of feature additions which I'll be keen to give a go if they do make it into Wreckreation. One's an "accident black spots" mode mirroring classic Burnout's brilliant crash mode, in which you're given a junction and tasked with causing as costly a pileup as possible. There's also a "tightrope mode" all about driving along very narrow airborne obstacle courses, the ability to add buildings to the map while in the game's live mix building mode, and a bunch of construction vehicles and trucks you can drive around.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy.</p><p>Since the launch of *Wreckreation*, our small… <a href="https://t.co/4lq7irQrNF">pic.twitter.com/4lq7irQrNF</a></p></div>— Wreckreation Game (@ArcadeDriving) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadeDriving/status/1996584475682115871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Of all those, the crash mode's something I could genuinely see giving Wreckreation some bounce-back potential, assuming the likes of BeamNG.Drive haven't filled that void in many players' minds. The ability to essentially build your own towns could also go a long way to helping put a plaster on one of the game's biggest problems - its boringly barren worldspace outside of player-built sky spaghetti.</p>
<p>"My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," Sperry wrote. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team." As of writing, Three Fields still plan to deliver an update adding crossplay to Wreckreation before Christmas.</p>
<p>All the news we report about game developers losing their jobs or being at risk of that sees us send our best to the folks affected, but I'm particularly sad to see Three Fields in this tough situation. That's largely because I really enjoyed the work Sperry, Alex Ward and co did on Burnout and Need For Speed while at Criterion, with both those series either dormant or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">currently on hold</a>.</p>
<p>Both Wreckreation and 2019's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dangerous-driving">Dangerous Driving</a> had a chance to be Three Fields' big 'Burnout's back, baby' moments, conclusively proving to the suits at EA that locking the series in the attic of dormant entities was a hugely short-sighted move. Neither quite managed to stick the landing, though. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckreation-melds-burnouts-anarchy-with-gta-onlines-airborne-marble-runs-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-polish">my hours playing both</a>, I've never felt like that faliure was down to them being cynical nostalgia-fests, attempts to cash in on the anarchic old arcade racers myself and others fell in love with. Instead, and perhaps this is because I've gone in each time hoping I'll be blown away, the two games felt like the vision was solid, but the small studio just hadn't been able to nail the nuances of execution.</p><p>They weren't a million miles off reigniting the magic of classic Burnout, with EA and Criterion's substantial resources behind it. They're still yet to get there, though. Here's hoping that another publisher who're willing to back Three Fields swoop in and as always, solidarity to the studio's staff as they face an uncertain future.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today. The Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 game was already getting dinged in some people’s minds over a trailer that showcased overly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368"><span>chatty companion characters</span></a><span>. Now we’ve moved on from side-eyeing MCU-era cringe to debates about whether or not the game even looks good. A lot of folks are throwing tomatoes at the supposedly lifeless open-world segments on social media, but people who are actually playing </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>tell a different story.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, some </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>screenshots are pretty rough. The game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-amiibo-samus-music-motorcycle-functionality-2000650508"><span>desert sections</span></a><span> can look pretty bland in still shots, and without any real dynamic weather effects or notable architecture and landmarks, they look like something out of a game from almost 20 years ago. The comparisons to older games that it resembles, or even older games that are doing a lot more with their environments, are not flattering.</span></p>

There are plenty of ugly areas in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, but there are also ones that look pretty lovely. </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, though? That shit looks like an ugly GameCube game that was still in early development, no matter where you are. So when another big Nintendo game seems to be following the same open-world style at the expense of detailed environments, it’s understandable why some folks would be worried.</span></p>

 <p><span>In general, </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has some notable graphic disparities depending on the environment you’re in. Folks have been noting this before the game was even out by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1nf7yrd/i_cant_wrap_my_head_around_how_theres_such_a_big/"><span>comparing shots from the same trailer</span></a><span>, in which the game oscillated between looking pretty alright to looking like the shots people are complaining about.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, some of this feels like knee-jerk reactions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>’s series-low reviews. The game is sitting at </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/"><span>a respectable 81 on review aggregate site Metacritic</span></a><span>, but that is a bit of a drop compared to the 90+ scores of the first three games. I saw folks on a ResetEra forum saying this was “an absolute failure” or a “fucking disaster” for the historically beloved series, so some of this drive-by hate feels a bit reactionary to a game some people have already decided is a flop.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But what are people who have actually played the game saying? I was surprised to see some folks on my feed also call it one of the best-looking games Nintendo had brought to its handheld console. However, most of the praise points specifically to the smaller-scale dungeon areas, rather than the open-world ones, even comparing its mood and visual identity to the </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>games, which makes sense considering staff who used to work on the series at 343 Industries have </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1996542214466687263"><span>moved over to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>developer Retro</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retro’s art design still rocks! Metroid Prime 4 is a visual stunner — and no framerate drops in sight.

 <p><span>“Within each dungeon-like area to explore, Metroid Prime 4 shines, mixing tactile FPS exploration with gorgeous visuals and impeccable atmosphere,” Oscar Taylor-Kent said in the </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span> review.</span></p> <p><span>Now that players have </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> in their hands, some are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pdrahj/stunned_how_good_prime_4_looks_within_first_hour/"><span>praising the visuals</span></a><span>, especially in those smaller, more focused spaces.</span></p> <p><span>“Retro is a master of using mostly baked plus some tasteful dynamic lighting to achieve great visuals,” Reddit user threeinacorner wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“You really need to see it on a highly capable OLED TV with really good HDR.

<p>Total War: Medieval 3 has been confirmed by the developers through a new announcement; the title is currently in its early pre-production stage. </p>



<p>The last instalment of Total War: Medieval was launched back in 2006, and the players have been aching for a new iteration of the series. Fortunately for them, Medieval 3 has been announced, and the developers have shared a wealth of details about the project through a new blog post and trailer. </p>







<h2 id="h-total-war-medieval-3-will-be-the-ultimate-what-if-game">Total War: Medieval 3 Will Be the Ultimate “What If” Game</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> featured Total War: Medieval 3’s game director, Pawel Wojs, providing players with all the details about the upcoming title. Wojs has worked on the previous instalment for almost 20 years and is now going to lead the latest project. The developer’s vision is to make Medieval 3 “the Total War sandbox set within the Medieval world and to be the ultimate “What if?” game where you can alter the course of history.” Interested readers can learn more about their <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vision</a> here.</p>

<p>The developers plan to achieve this by immersing players in historical accuracy and having the world respond “in ways that feel genuinely plausible.” The game is currently in early pre-production, with release years away, and they are just past the opening stages. The developers also have Warxore now, which is the next evolution of their game engine, which provides them “a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks – all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve.”</p>
