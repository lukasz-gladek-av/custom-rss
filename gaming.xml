<p>Smooth as a Morph Ball 'round a half pipe</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section><p>After having completed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> on Switch 2, booting the game up on the original Switch was an immediately familiar, if bizarre experience. The game was almost certainly made with Nintendo’s 2017 system in mind from the off given how long it’s been in development, and yet there’s something about playing it on the original Switch that just feels… odd.</p>
<p>Don’t leap to any mad conclusions. It plays very well at a very solid 60fps in both docked and handheld, but after getting used to seeing Viewros in stunning 4K (or an internal resolution approaching it), it’s surprising how much the art direction seems to have been built with this in mind. This also lacks the (<a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/metroid-prime-4-proves-retro-studios-prowess-on-switch-2#:~:text=In%20either%20resolution,of%20existing%20abilities.">excellent</a>) HDR support of the NS2 Edition.</p>
<p>Playing this on Switch 1 when docked feels fine enough, but that crispness, that pop, that ludicrously intricate, high-contrast detail, it’s just a bit fuzzy and pixelly by comparison. I personally feel it’s almost the direct antithesis to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, which actually felt as though the art style was more cohesive on the weaker platform. Textures have taken an understandable hit, and models that are further away can look quite smeary, but overall the game still looks good. I just can't help but compare it unfavourably to Switch 2.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:194214 @ 1764770487 -->
<p>Handheld takes things further down, as you would hopefully have already guessed. Wide shots of Samus when she’s being loaded into the transport cannon thing just don’t look right, as though you’ve somehow mucked up some settings; you can taste the sub-720p-ness. It’s perfectly passable for such aged hardware, but I can’t help but feel that as time went on, the Switch 2 version became the focus. It's safe to say things in the final build aren't the crystal-clear examples we were shown in earlier trailers.</p>
<p>That’s another change you can expect: loading screens. They’re relatively brisk on Switch 2 to the point that Ollie rightfully didn’t feel the need to mention them in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our primary review of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, but on Switch 1 you really feel them. Some of them are easily double and even triple the length, which can be a pain if you’re doing a lot of jumping from one area to another in quick succession.</p>
<p>All that being said, the game runs just as smoothly as it does in the Switch 2’s quality mode. I wasn’t able to shake the 60fps target at all, bar perhaps one exception when out in the Sol Valley when I presume some enemy models were loading. It simultaneously feels like it’s pushing the old hardware to its absolute limit, and yet manages to run at 60fps without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>If Switch 1 is your only means of playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, you’re not going to have <em>quite</em> the same experience, but if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had. Just keep your visual expectations in check after seeing all that delicious Switch 2 Edition footage.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i></a> <span>got a </span><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world"><span>major patch last night</span></a><span>, and most of the changes in the update are what you’d expect. There are some bug fixes, track tweaks, and some smaller stuff, like making specific items respawn faster. But on top of all this good stuff, Nintendo also did one of the most obnoxious, Nintendo-ass things it could have possibly done by making its audio settings a toggle, rather than a slider for players to adjust to their liking.</span></p> <p><span>As demonstrated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kzxcellent.live/post/3m72cm4q6zk2t">this clip</a>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-online-three-lap-2000628126"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new update adds a “Music Volume” option in the racer’s settings that lets you adjust how loud the music is while you’re driving around and throwing blue shells at each other. However, the only options you have in this setting are “Normal” and “Loud.” You can’t tweak these presets at all, and most people who adjust the music volume in video games aren’t making it </span><i><span>louder</span></i><span>; they’re usually trying to balance it so they can hear audio cues, voice acting, or whatever they’re trying to hone in on.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650068">© Nintendo / @kzxcellent.live on Bluesky / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Audio options can be helpful for a lot of reasons, but they are, at their core, an accessibility accommodation, and Nintendo has a history of weird oversights like this. </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>famously locked its audio settings behind </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hi-tech_Earbuds"><span>an in-game item</span></a><span> you couldn’t get until you were hours into the game. Adding music volume settings and making it a toggle that only gets louder, rather than quieter, sounds like someone at Nintendo heard someone asking for audio options, then didn’t bother to ask why or what they should do. It’s annoying, but it’s also incredibly funny because it feels like Nintendo is so insistent that it isn’t going along with the rest of the industry that it won’t even look at other games or companies as a reference for how to handle basic quality-of-life settings.</span></p> <p><span>The full patch notes are as follows:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>General</strong></p> <ul> <li>Added “Custom Items” to the item rules. <ul> <li>This is a feature that lets you set which items appear.</li> <li>This is supported in “VS Race”, “Balloon Battle”, “Coin Runners”, and “Room” in “Online Play” or “Wireless

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-strikes-google-hard-now-selling-fitbit-charge-6-at-all-time-low-after-cyber-monday-2000650049</link>
            <guid>1371505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon extended its Cyber Week deals into December with continued discounts on major brands including Fitbit, which Google acquired to strengthen its wearables lineup. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/">Fitbit Charge 6 fitness tracker dropped to $99 on Amazon, matching the Cyber Monday price and slashing $60 off the regular $159 tag</a> and this all-time low makes the Charge 6 accessible for anyone who wants detailed health tracking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Accuracy</h2>
<p>The Fitbit Charge 6<strong> sends your heart rate in real time to exercise machines</strong> that can use Bluetooth which means that treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes can show your actual heart rate instead of using their often-unreliable handlebar sensors. This connection is important for interval training or heart rate zone workouts where you need exact feedback to keep up the right level of intensity. Fitbit changed the heart rate sensor array on the Charge 6 to <strong>make it more accurate during high-intensity movements</strong>. This was done in response to complaints that previous models lost tracking during vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in GPS records your pace, distance, and elevation data</strong> while you run, walk, or ride your bike outside. You don’t need to bring your phone with you; the data will sync with the Fitbit app once you’re back in Bluetooth range. You can leave your phone behind while you work out and still get all the information about your route for later analysis. The GPS receiver locks onto satellites quickly, unlike older fitness trackers that sometimes took a few minutes to get a signal.</p>



<p>When you start directions on your phone, <strong>Google Maps integration shows turn-by-turn directions right on the Charge 6’s screen</strong>. This puts navigation prompts on your wrist so you can see them without taking out your phone. With Google Wallet support, you can tap to pay at checkout terminals with cards stored in your Google account. This means you don’t have to carry your wallet around when you run quick errands or go get coffee. When you play music through the app on your phone, music controls show up on the tracker’s display. This lets you control playback without having to touch your device while you work out.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep trackin</strong>g keeps track of how long you spend in light, deep, and REM sleep stages during the night. This gives you more information about the quality of your sleep than just the total hours you slept. The Sleep Score algorithm takes into account how long you slept, how restful it was, and how well it restored you to create a single number that tells you how well you actually slept. Morning readiness scores look at your recent activity, sleep, and heart rate variability to suggest whether you should work hard or take it easy during your workout today. Stress management tools check your heart rate variability and start guided breathing sessions when the tracker sees that your stress levels are too high.</p>



<p>The <strong>six-month Premium membership that comes with it</strong> gives you access to advanced analytics, guided programs, and detailed health metrics that help you see patterns in your data. Premium gives you daily readiness scores, advanced sleep analysis, and workout suggestions that are tailored to your fitness level and recent activity. You can keep using core tracking features after the trial period ends without paying for Premium, but you won’t be able to access the extra insights and guided content.</p>
<p>Depending on how often you use GPS and other power-hungry features,<strong> the battery can last up to seven days between charges</strong>. This is a huge improvement over smartwatches that need to be charged every night. When you don’t have much time, quick charging adds a full day of battery in just 12 minutes. Fitbit i<strong>ncludes both small and large bands in the box</strong>&nbsp;so the tracker can fit wrists that are 5.5 to 8.1 inches around without the need to buy extra bands.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is now in the entry-level fitness tracker price range at $99, but it has features that are usually only found on devices that cost $150 or more. The $60 discount and six months of Premium included make this a great deal because Premium costs $10 a month on its own.</p>

<p>Pokémon fans appear to have hit the nail on the head with a huge fan theory regarding Pokémon Pokopia, with leaks confirming the speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases on March 5, 2026</a>, putting players in control of a playable Ditto that has transformed into a human, with the game’s setting showing islands filled with Pokémon but no humans in sight.</p>



<p>That has led to intense speculation that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, and a fresh leak seems to confirm that environment.</p>







<h2 id="h-leaked-pokemon-pokopia-map-shows-post-apocalyptic-kanto">Leaked Pokémon Pokopia Map Shows Post-Apocalyptic Kanto</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Posting on X, <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1996007165002199320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a> shared what is claimed to be the Pokémon Pokopia map, and the translation shows that a post-apocalyptic adventure through Kanto is on the cards.</p>



<p>Areas on the map include Fuschia, with “dried up and unfertilized fieldland,” Pewter, “an abandoned mine covered by rocks,” and, perhaps the most telling of them all, the Viridian Area with a “never-ending burning forest of ash.”</p>



<p>All of those areas are well known in the Kanto region, with Fuschia City being the home of the Safari Zone, Pewter City presenting the first gym badge test against Brock, and Viridian Forest being one of the first areas players explore in the world of Kanto.</p>



<p>Additional content, reportedly arriving in DLC or as part of post-launch updates, includes areas for Cerulean, Cinnibar, Lavender, and Celedon.</p>



<p>Ever since the first trailer of Pokémon Pokopia appeared, fans have theorized that the game’s setting would be a post-apocalptic version of Kanto, with major hints including a destroyed first-generation Pokédex and the remnants of buildings like Pokémon Centers.</p>



<p>Fans have also theorised that Peakychu, the mysterious ghost-like version of Pikachu, is the deceased version of Red’s partner Pokémon Pokopia, and Mosslax, a Snorlax covered in greenery, is the same Snorlax that players in the Kanto region are tasked with waking up by using the Pokéflute.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether those theories are true, and it could be that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in an alternate universe away from the main franchise. </p>



<p>While this may seem far-fetched, Pokémon has blown open the doors to craziness with the likes of time-travelling in Pokémon Legends: Z-A and wormholes in Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon.</p>

Brace for impact!</p>
<p>Yes, Rolling Stone has dropped its 25 favourite gaming experiences of the year and, whilst the number one spot is absolutely no surprise (congratulations to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>), we've been tickled pink to see that good old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a> has managed to secure a number three spot via all that wrecking shop he did in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Bananza</a>. The big man has smashed his way onto a prestigious podium there, so well done, Mr. Kong. And nice tie!</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4olxjuy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Elsewhere on the list, some 10 spaces down in fact, you'll spot another Switch 2-shaped mention in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Honestly, we probably wouldn't have expected that DK would outdo Master Mascot Mario in this way if you'd told us in the summer, but we'd tend to agree on the placement rolling (no pun intended) the great ape's way here.</p>
<p>What else has delighted us in making the cut? Well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> dropping into a very nice 7th place is great, as that really was one of the year's big highlights on Switch, alongside the wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a>, and, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a>, which has pulled off a blinder by snatching the number 2 spot.</p>

<p>Oh, and look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, all the way down (if you can be all the way down on a top 25 list) at number 12. That isn't perhaps where we'd have expected to see such a massively well-reviewed game, but personal taste is a wondrous and mysterious thing, innit!</p>
<p>With a total of 11 of these games available on Switch consoles, it's still a very strong showing for Nintendo gamers - and hopefully we'll see Switch ports of some of these soon!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-install-size-on-pc-shrinks-by-85-percent-thanks-to-nixxes/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The millions of players who regularly enjoy Helldivers 2 on PC (sales estimates put Steam owners at between 13 and 21 million) can rejoice, as the game's install size on this platform <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can now be reduced by around 85%</a>. Helldivers 2 previously took roughly 154GB of space from a drive, but Nixxes (the Dutch PC port specialist that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-nixxes-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was acquired by Sony in July 2021</a>) helped Arrowhead shrink it down to just 23GB, saving you 131GB of space.</p>



<p>The developers have completed several rounds of internal QA and are rolling this out as a public technical beta. Internal testing shows that, in the worst cases, mission loading times have only increased by a few seconds for the small percentage of players still using mechanical hard disk drives.</p>



<p>Before doing this, Arrowhead measured the number of players actively playing Helldivers 2 on a mechanical HDD. As of last week, it was around 11% of the total. The majority of the loading time in the game is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation occurs in parallel with loading assets from the disk, making it the primary factor in loading time. Critically, testing showed that HDD users are only getting slightly worse mission loading times, in the order of a few seconds in the worst cases. This convinced Arrowhead to go ahead with the public technical beta.</p>



<p>If everything goes well during this testing phase, the developers plan to discontinue the legacy version sometime next year. Those interested in testing the reduced install size can opt in immediately by selecting the game in their Steam library, then navigating to Properties &gt; Beta Participation and selecting prod_slim from the dropdown list.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is by far Sony's most significant live service success. In the span of a month since its launch in February 2024, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-has-reportedly-sold-way-more-than-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already sold more than five million units across PC and PlayStation 5</a>, with the former platform accounting for the lion's share. In August 2025, the game launched even on Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately performed well over there</a>, too.</p>



<p>The most recent large update is September's Into the Unjust, which introduced new enemies, missions, and Hive Worlds.</p>

Fans have been waiting almost a decade for the next entry in Samus’ first-person adventures.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-compatible-samsung-microsdxc-black-friday-deal-2000650000</link>
            <guid>1371457</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There is nothing more annoying, frustrating, and heartbreaking than having to delete your old titles just to make room for new ones. We’ve all been in those situations, but there’s a simple way out. Investing in a microSD card can give your storage the boost it needs, and we just spotted a solid option going for a lot less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">The 512GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card, which is made for Nintendo Switch, is currently going at a 25% discount.</a> This brings its price down to just $75, saving you a nice $15. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to since its release, but the offer is only around for a short time. Grab it while it’s still live, because once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Capacity, Better Speeds</h2>
<p>Starting off with the storage; the 512GB capacity is more than enough to house all your favorite titles and other downloadable content (DLCs) that you can’t squeeze into the internal storage of your console. It’s not as massive as 1TB, sure, but unless you’re looking to store massive libraries, it’s going to be sufficient. Sequential read speeds of up to 800 MB/s make it easy to access games and get back into action (literally) up to four times faster than most other options in the same range. These speeds translate into quicker load times and much faster updates.</p>
<p>Installation couldn’t be simpler. Just turn your Nintendo Switch off, locate the kickstand on the back, and open it. Look for the dedicated slot and gently insert the card into it. Once it clicks into place, turn your console on and follow any on-screen instructions that pop up. It should be up and running within minutes!</p>



<p>The card plays nicely with Nintendo Switch 2, plus microSD UHS-I devices like computers, tablets, cameras, and select handheld consoles. It’s built to last you for years to come, thanks to its 6 layers of protection. It is waterproof (capable of withstanding up to 72 hours in seawater), temperature-proof with operating temperatures of -13 degrees Fahrenheit to 185 degrees Fahrenheit, X-Ray proof, magnetic-proof, plus drop-proof up to 16.4 feet. Even with all this, Samsung offers a limited warranty of 3 years that covers you if anything goes wrong. The card features a dynamic thermal guard that keeps it cool even during those intense sessions that demand a lot of power. To unlock its full performance, it’s best to use it with the Samsung Magician Software. It lets you verify the product’s authenticity, plus keep an eye on your drive’s health to ensure optimal performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a reliable, easy-to-use storage solution, this 512GB Samsung microSD card is an excellent option to consider, especially at this lowest price.</a> It gets you the storage you need, plus faster transfer speeds and exceptional compatibility. If 512GB is more than you need, there’s a 256GB version going for $55, but it’s not discounted. Getting your orders in now will also help you save on the delivery charges, whether you are a Prime member or not. Just be sure to act fast, as drops this massive don’t stick around forever. It’s one of the remaining Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, and we’re expecting it to wrap within a few hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is finally getting the long-awaited, and heavily rumored, Ninjago collab next week, with the official account posting the first teaser.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s LEGO-themed survival mode is now entering its second full year since release, and, after a period of a huge drop in updates to the mode, the biggest collab so far is poised to be introduced.</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-fortnite-ninjago-coming-december-11">LEGO Fortnite Ninjago Coming December 11</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New island? Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a teaser post on Twitter, the official LEGO Fortnite account told players to “get ready to master a new adventure in Odyssey,” which will arrive on December 11.</p>



<p>Although it did not mention Ninjago outright, there were big teasers in the emojis that were posted alongside the message, showing an ice cube, a lightning bolt, a cloud, and a Ninja.</p>



<p>The post also confirms when Fortnite’s first major update of Chapter 7 Season 1 will be, which will also see the return of Fortnite OG with a new season, and will set the scene ahead of the Winterfest event later this month.</p>



<p>Rumors of a Ninjago collab coming to LEGO Fortnite have been widespread for a while, and the arrival of the collab will be the biggest update since the Lost Isles update in September 2024.</p>



<p>Since then, the only major update to the mode was the addition of split-screen support, and there had been discontent among the community for the lack of content updates.</p>



<p>However, the Ninjago update on December 11 should appease those concerns with a host of new content, similar to what was introduced in the Lost Isles update and the LEGO Star Wars update.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has cast a new voice actress for Samus.</p>
<p>If (or should that be when) you succumb to the barrage of enemies that will be heading your way on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release tomorrow, it will not be Jennifer Hale that you will hear screaming in pain. </p>
<p>Rather for this release, Hale - who lent her vocal talents to the role of Samus in the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> trilogy - has instead been replaced with American stage and voice actress Erin Yvette.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>You may have already heard Yvette's voice in many of earlier works. Yvette's previous video game roles include Snow White in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/telltale-games">Telltale Games</a>' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a> and Alex in Night School Studio's debut Oxenfree.</p>
<p>More recently, the actress also voiced Blonde Blazer in AdHoc's brilliant (I honestly can't recommend this game enough) superhero workplace comedy, Dispatch.</p>
<p>It is worth noting though, that while Yvette is credited with voicing Samus in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the character doesn't exactly talk your ear off in the game. Rather, it is more about those all important effort noises when Samus is making her way through the world, and of course that death scream. To give more context, Yvette's performance in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is on par with Hale's own performance as Samus in Metroid Prime 3, I am reliably told.</p>

<p>For more on Samus' chatter (or lack thereof), our Alex recently shared his thoughts about Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's almost silent protagonist. You can check it out here: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-chatty-companions-silent-samus-the-problem">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty space marine companions aren't so bad - it's Samus who is this game's narrative problem</a>.</p><p>As for the game more generally, well it comes out tomorrow, so there's not too much longer to wait until you can hear Yvette's grunts in action for yourself. "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review</a>.</p>

			<p>The core survival-horror elements of Resident Evil Requiem have been showcased effectively in recent events (<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2025-awards-resident-evil-requiem-capcom/">such as Gamescom 2025</a>), but a crucial part of the experience, combat, has remained unseen until today. Unfortunately, the reveal wasn't accompanied by the confirmation all fans are waiting for: <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">the presence of Leon Kennedy in the game. </a></p>



<p>A few hours ago, new Resident Evil Requiem combat footage started making the rounds online. The short clip was shown in a series' special program which aired in Japan earlier today. This clip showcases a brand-new area and Grace fighting multiple zombies using a handgun in some third-person sequences that are highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4. <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As known insider Dusk Golem</a> stressed, having aired on Japanese television, the footage was captured from a censored version of the game, so blood and gore should be as usual in the international version of the game.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One thing I'll clarify is since this aired on Japanese television, this is 100% the censored Japanese version. RE games get a "censored" version and a "Z-Rated" version released in Japan, things like headshots/dismemberment are always censored in the Japanese non-Z rated versions</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996166803119349812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-leon-kennedy-speculation-continues">The Leon Kennedy Speculation Continues</h2>



<p>With the first Resident Evil Requiem combat footage not showing Leon Kennedy in action, the window for such a critical reveal is becoming tighter. </p>



<p>In the previous months, it was speculated that the protagonist of the second and fourth main entries in the series would be the focus of the game's combat elements, and revealing his presence alongside the combat mechanics would have made a lot of sense. Hopes haven't been dashed completely, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">game producer Masato Kumazawa recently addressed the rumors without denying them</a>, though, so there's still a chance the beloved character will be the second protagonist of Resident Evil Requiem alongside Grace Ashcroft.</p>



<p>No matter what, there's no denying that Resident Evil Requiem is looking great in the new footage. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">The new entry in the series felt really promising when I tried it out during this year's Gamescom</a>, and I look forward to delving deeper into the darkness when the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch on February 27.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-drops-next-month-brings-back-a-beloved-dark-souls-bumkicker">Forsaken Hollows expansion</a> arrives tomorrow, December 4th. Ahead of letting folks dive into Limveld's big hole and try out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlcs-first-new-class-looks-great-for-book-nerds-and-grubby-old-men-lovers">new nightfarer classes</a>, FromSoft have lobbed out the customary big patch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This patch, 1.03, is out now and decently beefy. Looking through the notes, the studio have taken the opportunity to add a a fair amount of new features, with most being minor tweaks which make certain menus easier to parse, allow you to quickly check which relics you're rocking or how many flasks you've got left, and ensure personal objectives don't impede teaming-up. Some shop inventories have also been rearranged or added to.</p>
<p>Arguably the most noteworthy thing about the patch is that FromSoft have opted not to make nightfarer-specific tweaks as part of their latest round of balancing. Instead, stock changes to passive, special and relic effects have been drafted in, with melee attacks made more powerful, while dashing and rolling strikes have also been boosted. Meanwhile, effects that help negate damage when you're already at low health have been made less effective, which is bad news for less tanky builds.</p>
<p>Given the Forsaken Hollows is supposed to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">slightly tougher cookie than the base game</a> anyway, you may want to go back to an old fashioned 'hit everyything with a big stick while cowering behind a tonne of armour plating' type of setup if you're keen to maximise your chances of not being forsakenly hollowed out.</p><p>Rounding out the patch are the usual bug fixes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>There’s a great 1st anniversary party happening for <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em>, and new players and longtime franchise fans are all invited. Two huge new events, three powerful new dolls—as anniversary celebrations go, this is a big one.</span></p>
<p><span>The fireworks begin on Nov. 27 with a massive overhaul of the Crew Deck, the launch of the <em>Deep Oblivion</em> and <em>Intertwined Assault</em> events, and the debut of new dolls Leva and Lenna. <em>Deep Oblivion</em> is a two-part event, with part 2 dropping on Dec. 18 along with Robella, the third new doll. There are also huge player rewards to be found, including more than 130 pulls and over 13,000 Collapse Pieces. Needless to say, this is an event <em>GFL2</em> fans will not want to miss, and a golden opportunity for new fans to step up and experience this global phenomenon.</span></p>

<h2>Inside the New Crew Deck</h2>
<p><span>The Elmo’s Crew Deck has been upgraded, and the brand-new gameplay is now live. In this updated space, Commanders will find not only fully realized 3D versions of the collectible cabinet and armory, but also a variety of new interactive story moments between Commanders and T-Dolls.</span></p>
<p><span>When the update goes live, Commanders will immediately find Makiatto’s exclusive story <em>Time Capsule: Pulse-Racing Night</em> in their inbox. If you already own Makiatto’s Embroidered Bamboo Blooming Shadows outfit, you can jump right into this free story. Klukai also gets in on the special features, with a Cerulean Breaker outfit (pictured above) that comes with a new Body Maintenance Technician item.</span></p>
<p><span>With more stories, outfits, and furniture for Commanders to invest in, the Crew Deck gets a little more homey and personalized with each addition. And with a brand-new holography function, players can actually embody select Dolls inside the Crew Dec, starting with Klukai, but with more to follow.</span></p>
<p><span>The Crew Deck is a completely new space, no longer just a menu, but an interactive showcase. Among the other anniversary-celebration innovations debuting on Nov. 27:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>3D Ornament Cabinet &amp; Armory</span></li>
<li><span>Memory Corridor for special scene collections</span></li>
<li><span>Crimson Arcade, a minigame zone</span></li>
<li><span>Interior decoration tools</span></li>
<li><span>Tea Break system to unlock extra interactions</span></li>
<li><span>Dreamscape, an atmospheric feature for additional world-building</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Loot, Loot, and More Loot</h2>
<p><span>Normally an anniversary party involves gifts being given to the celebrants. But for <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em>‘s big celebration, it’s the players who will be the ones on the receiving end of a staggering amount of free stuff.</span></p>
<p><span>Commanders who participate in the full season of events are in for a serious haul, including over 130 free pulls, over 13,000 Collapse Pieces, 2 free outfits, and a massive array of other upgrade materials, tokens, and Crew Deck bonuses. When the Crew Deck Date Reward arrives on Nov. 27, that’s stacked with </span><span>35 Outfit Access Permissions, </span><span>10 Access Permissions, an Elmo Model Ornament, 300 Collapse Pieces, and multiple other growth materials.</span></p>
<p><span>Other goodies include a free Dragon Chef outfit for Qiuhua available in the Glory Store, and an automatic unlocking of Springfield’s Enjoy the Fragrance. There are more Access Permissions available by completing daily missions, through mail rewards, furniture exchange, gift packs, and the seasonal Battle Pass.</span></p>
<h2>Don’t Miss the Live-Action Trailer</h2>
<p><span>Even with all of these updates, new Dolls, and massive rewards, another exciting part of the <em>GFL2</em> 1st anniversary celebration is a live-action trailer featuring the legendary 404 Squad. The video showcases the characters’ relaxed daily life on the Crew Deck, while also featuring intense combat action.You’ll see the 404 Squad engage in desert firefights and blackout industrial battles, with Humvees, Gatling guns, and a heavily armed helicopter aiding their cause.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646758" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646758"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646758">© Sunborn Games</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Even before this giant anniversary party, it’s easy to see how <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> has become such a worldwide success. Whether you’re a <em>GFL2</em> veteran or you’re just hearing all the rave reviews now and want to see what it’s all about, it’s an awesome experience on PC, or mobile on both Android and iOS devices. Commanders, join in and celebrate the anniversary!</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horses Is The New Viral Horror Game Banned On Steam & Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/horses-is-the-new-viral-horror-game-banned-on-steam-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>1371412</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Horses was banned at the final hour by Steam and the Epic Games Store due to the game’s unsettling and controversial content, but you can still buy the viral horror title.</p>



<p>The initial premise of Horses seems quite simple: You’re on a two-week break working at a farm. You perform standard tasks, such as feeding the farmer’s dog and tending to the ‘horses.’ It becomes quickly apparent that they aren’t normal horses, and the game quickly descends into a host of horrifying and inhumane themes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-deals-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and Epic didn’t like this much.</p>







<h2 id="h-you-can-still-buy-horses-elsewhere">You Can Still Buy Horses Elsewhere</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Yes, a carrot. Credit to Santa Ragione Game Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mere hours before its launch, <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Horses</a> was banned from Steam and the Epic Games Store. If anything, this has furthered the game’s profile with people desperate to understand why.</p>







<p>Take a look at this content warning on the Horses website to get an idea of what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This game contains scenes of physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Insider Gaming has seen lots of the game’s footage and the aforementioned content—it’s just as perturbing and disturbing as you can imagine. The Epic Games Store says Horses is still “Coming Soon,” but you don’t have to wait, as the horror game is available to buy on GOG. </p>



<p>The ban decisions could be overturned in the future, especially if Santa Ragione Game Studio fights back, and popularity in the title explodes. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor Horses’ status.</p>



<p>If you’ve played Horses, now’s your chance to share. Is the full game as psychologically damaging as it’s made out to be? Was Steam and the Epic Games Store right to ban it?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/</link>
            <guid>1371409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An artist whose art was stolen by Bungie’s Marathon has now claimed that the issue with Bungie and Sony has been resolved to her satisfaction.</p>



<p>The news came more than six months after the artist took to <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to say that Bungie had used the assets she created in 2017 without permission. Back then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she claimed</a>, “The Marathon alpha released recently, and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017.”</p>







<div><p>The claim was almost immediately picked up by Bungie, who said,</p><p>“We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game.</p></div>



<p>This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to @4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.</p>



<p>As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</p>



<p>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</p>



<p>We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</p>



<div><p> But now, the issue has been fully resolved, with the artist saying,</p><p>“The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.”</p></div>



<p>As to the extent the issue was resolved, that will likely never be shared, but Sony and Bungie have seemingly gone to great lengths to ensure the artist has been fully compensated and/or reached an agreement. </p>







<p>Bungie’s Marathon is scheduled to release by the end of this fiscal year (by April 1st, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think the artist got to resolve the issue? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>

IGN Japan was in attendance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Monster Hunter Wilds was first released on February 28, some players left harsh feedback, but Tokuda said the team worked to improve the game by taking advantage of that feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Immediately after the release, we apologized for the inconvenience caused by the volume of content and the difficulty level. Despite this, we were delighted to receive various awards, including Users' Choice awards. We would like to thank all the players who have given their opinions and spoken warm words even in this situation. The development team was able to turn everyone's feedback into an asset and work on the update with all our strength, and I think the result was also the reason why players voted for us," said Tokuda.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/img-3587-1764763663206.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yuya Tokuda (left) and Ryozo Tsujimoto (right) at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia held in Tokyo on December 3.

There are still updates left to come, so we will continue to do our best," added Tsujimoto.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter series celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. The franchise was a hit in Japan, and after the release of Monster Hunter: World in 2018, it grew into a literal monster title overseas. According to Tokuda, the Monster Hunter Wilds team were more aware than ever of being accepted by newcomers or those who had trouble beating the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including Monster Hunter: World. We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armor. In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users,” said Tokuda. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda said the team has focused on creating more difficult content with each update. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again," said Tokuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds still has updates to come, but Tsujimoto also talked a little about the future of the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here. We plan to continue, and we want to let more people play. In addition, I would like to think about things beyond the games so that we can further expand the potential of the Monster Hunter IP," said Tsujimoto.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Low Rank Armor in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From Tsujimoto's remarks, it seems we can continue to look forward to new games and more in the Monster Hunter series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tsujimoto was also asked where Monster Hunter stands within the overall catalog of Capcom IP, which he answered diplomatically. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Capcom is a company with various IPs, and every IP is very important. I'm in charge of Monster Hunter now, that’s all I can comment on, but as Capcom, we want to expand all our IPs,” he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is scheduled to release Resident Evil Requiem, Onimusha Way of the Sword, and Pragmata in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>"After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions," we wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 9/10 review</a>, describing Samus' latest adventure as "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date".

		<p>Nintendo has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update 1.4.0, making a big bunch of changes and bug fixes to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2’s</a> biggest game.</p>
<p>Amongst the changes are a new custom items rule setting, which lets you pick exactly which items appear in your game – this is really handy for anyone chasing the last few Kamek transformation character!</p>


<p>There’s also an improved way to join up and play multiplayer with friends, as up to four players gathered together in a “Room” can all take part in Race, Knockout Tour and Battle, and you can also join people playing Knockout Tour when in 2P and Online as well.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also changed the course layout for eight of the Intermission style point-to-point races involving Koopa Troopa Beach. All the races heading there will now have two laps of Koopa Troopa Beach once you get there. We hope this is a sign of more changes to come!</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Mario Kart World update 1.4.0:</p>

            <p>Valve’s quiet bankrolling of open-source emulation tools could make it heaps easier to play your PC games library on a humble smartphone, though it sounds like Gabe-made SteamOS phones are unlikely to be joining the company’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">growing hardware catalogue</a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">The Verge</a>, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed that they’ve been funding the development of Fex – a free compatibility tool that gets Windows apps functioning on mobile ARM processors – since well before revealing the ARM-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> standalone VR headset.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve's bundling Fex into SteamOS so the Frame, due in 2026, can run Steam games straight off the headset’s internal chip. But it is already out in the wild right now – i.e. <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX">GitHub</a> –, and has a promising future in bringing those very same games to Android phones. Just not, Griffais says, phones with a Steam logo on them.</p>
<p>"I don’t know if that’s going to be a big focus for us to develop local content or try to develop SteamOS for devices like that" he explains. "I mean, I’m not discounting any possibility, but I think with just living room, handheld, and desktop, trying to have a good outcome for gaming applications and everything else you’d want to do in a desktop, we have a ton of work to do."</p>
<p>The living room and handheld formats clearly refer to, respectively, the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> and the existing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. But these are both based on x86 processors, much like a regular Windows PC or laptop. It’s ARM hardware, the diesel to x86’s unleaded, that Fex and the Frame are trying to crack – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-just-works-valve-talk-the-steam-frame-android-games-on-steamos-and-putting-a-pc-on-your-face">with at least some success</a>, judging by the slickness with which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> ran on the Frame when I tried it at Valve’s offices last month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Steam phone or no, Fex may fulfil that promise of Steam games on mobile. It is, for instance, one of multiple x86 emulation layers employed by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoji.egggame&amp;hl=en_GB">Gamehub</a>, an Android game launcher app produced by Chinese peripheral makers GameSir. I’ve tried this on my Pixel 9 and admittedly haven’t had much luck, even with the games I know work well on the Steam Frame: Hades 2 crashes immediately and Silksong gets stuck on an endless launching screen. Also, there’s a non-zero possibility that I’ve handed over my Gmail and Steam account details to the Chinese Communist Party. C'est la vie. You <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gamehub">don’t have to look far</a>, mind, for folks who’ve used Gamehub to get Androidified Steam games up and running, including the author of that Verge piece.</p><p>Hopefully this cross-device compatibility push continues apace; Valve obviously have a business interest in getting Steam games (uhhhh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">sorry Horses</a>) playable on as many computery doohickeys as possible, but kicking down compatibility barriers and spreading software across devices of the user’s choosing is good for the common gamesplayer as well.</p>

            <guid>1371376</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="96" data-end="911">Making progress in any sport really comes down to knowing your numbers. If you want to improve, you need a solid idea of what you’re working toward and a convenient way to keep an eye on it. Whether you’re just getting into running and hitting your favorite trails, jumping in open water for triathlon training, or biking some hills, a reliable GPS watch can make all the difference. It helps you stay motivated, stay on track, and avoid losing steam. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/">Conveniently, Samsung’s newly released 2025 version of its smartwatch—the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic—is still on sale post Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>. This watch normally goes for $500, but right now you can grab it for 20% off, bringing it down to $400. You end up saving yourself a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="96" data-end="911">Now this is the Classic model of the Watch 8. What’s different about it? First up, it’s much bigger. The standard models come in either 40mm or 44mm. This watch face measures across at 46mm. But more noticeable that that, the watch has a metal casing. The new lug system allows for easy band detachment and replacement. So when you’re not working out, this watch maintains a professional work you could even pair nicely with a suit. Then when it’s time to hit the pavement in your running attire, swap out the band for a silicone one, easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="913" data-end="946">A Fitness Coach on Your Wrist</h2>
<p data-start="948" data-end="1552">The Galaxy Watch 8 runs on Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform, which helps it deliver smarter health and fitness tracking. Whenever you head out for a ride, run, hike, or any sort of outdoor workout, the watch can keep tabs on how you’re performing in real time and compare it to your past sessions. Throughout the day, it can nudge you with personalized wellness suggestions to help you steadily move toward your fitness and health goals. The improved heart-rate tracking is also a big upgrade. It filters out the noise from natural body motion, giving you a more accurate reading than previous Samsung watches.</p>
<p data-start="1554" data-end="1991">Your sleep gets just as much attention. The Watch 8 tracks your patterns closely enough to flag possible signs of sleep apnea and gives you a much clearer look at how well you’re actually resting each night. When you wake up, you get a quick snapshot of your energy level and readiness for the day. It combines details like your sleep score, steps, heart-rate behavior, and more to give you a realistic picture of where your body stands.</p>


<p data-start="1993" data-end="2450">Of course, it’s not just about fitness. The Galaxy Watch 8 works great as a full-blown smartwatch for everyday life. You can read and respond to messages straight from your wrist without fishing your phone out of your pocket. And if it’s paired with your phone, the watch becomes a remote camera controller—perfect for group shots or selfies at a distance. You can change settings, hit the timer, and take the picture all from the watch.</p>
<p data-start="2485" data-end="2997">The new Watch 8 can hit up to 3,000 nits, while the Watch 7 maxes out at 2,000 nits. That extra brightness makes a big difference when you’re checking stats under direct sunlight. Both models are still tough enough for all-weather training, whether you’re out in the cold, the rain, or the heat.</p>
<p data-start="3279" data-end="3522"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/">The Galaxy Watch 8 is also designed from the ground up to work with Gemini, the AI assistant built by Samsung and Google</a>. You can use it to check your schedule, reply to texts, set reminders, and handle a bunch of everyday tasks with ease.</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii has said he "can't talk about" future plans for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, suggesting something is indeed in the works.</p>
<p>Though best known for Dragon Quest, Horii was a supervisor on the celebrated Chrono Trigger, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">celebrating its 30th anniversary this year</a>.</p>
<p>During Horii's latest talk show livestream KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku, he was asked about current buzz surrounding Chrono Trigger and whether this was "foreshadowing" a bigger announcement (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<p>Horii was also joined by former editor of Shonen Jump Kazuhiko Torishima, who noted a number of Chrono Trigger-related projects that were previously announced, including a concert series planned for next year. Torishima asked Horii if there would be any developments in the franchise.</p><p>"I can't talk about that," said Horii, becoming flustered. He added: "Wait, if I say that, you'll figure it out!", "Don't ask!", "Asking is off-limits!", and "I'll get in trouble!", to which the panel collectively laughed. Torishima cheekily replied: "There's something".</p>
<p>It would seem, then, there's at least something in the works, even if Horii remains tight-lipped on any details.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> acknowledged the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger earlier this year, stating it would launch "various projects that go beyond the world of the game over the next year to express our gratitude to everyone who has played Chrono Trigger so far."</p>
<p>Of course, fans speculated a remake or re-release could be in the works, though there's been nothing official on this. Horii's latest comments are certainly fueling the fire, however.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of other projects inspired by Chrono Trigger you can check out: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-clockwork-dlc-will-release-later-this-month">Sea of Stars received DLC</a> earlier this year, while future games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-a-french-made-rpg-that-takes-inspiration-from-japanese-rpgs-and-was-actually-made-by-a-team-of-30-edge-of-memories-should-scratch-that-itch">Edge of Memories</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-chrono-trigger-celebrates-30th-anniversary-spiritual-successor-threads-of-time-gets-fresh-gameplay-trailer">Threads of Time</a> are heavily inspired by Square Enix's classic.</p>

            <p>
Well-received horror game No Players Online has returned to Steam after nearly three weeks of unavailability, which its developer Beeswax Games has blamed on an "unfounded" DMCA takedown notice filed by a "former friend".
</p>
<p>
No Players Online is a narrative adventure in which players explore the files of a '90s desktop PC in order to uncover the secrets of a long-abandoned shooter. It started life as a short Game Jam title in 2019, garnering positive critical attention and something of a cult following - and an expanded reimagining was launched for Steam at the start of November. Not long after, keen-eyed horror fans began noticing it had disappeared, with Beeswax Games initially appearing unsure why, and promising to "figure out what's going on".

<p>
Three weeks on, Beeswax Games has announced No Players Online's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/">return to Steam</a>, shedding some light on the reason for its initial disappearance. "[The game] was removed from steam for nearly three weeks right after launch, following a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) claim made by a former friend," the studio explained in a <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement">message shared on its website</a>. "They claimed to be a co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it. No Players Online was made completely from scratch by our team."
</p><p>
Beeswax, which counts the 2019 game's trio of creators - Adam Pype, Tibau Van den Broeck, and Viktor Kraussays - among its number, say the unnamed individual "recklessly filed the DMCA to Steam without any notice", resulting in the game's removal a little over a week after launch. "We immediately filed a counter-notice," it continued, "and today the game has been reinstated after the time for them to respond has passed."
</p>
<p>
"It's crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form," it added. "It's been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone I considered a dear friend." Beeswax doesn't detail the specifics of the disagreement, only saying it attempted to offer clarity to the claimant prior to the filing that "their allegations were completely unfounded".
</p>
<p>
"This situation has had a significant impact on us," it continued, "especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us." The studio says it spent a "ton of money" over the two and a half years it took to complete No Players Online, and that its temporary removal from Steam means it "lost out on much needed momentum and revenue". As a result, Beeswax is "unsure if [it] will be able to recover financially" given its "already thin margins", and says the future of the studio is uncertain. However, it remains "committed to doing all that we have planned still for No Players Online".

DMCA copyright claims have proven highly controversial over the years, given the ease with which they can be abused. In 2023, for instance, Soviet city-builder game Workers &amp; Resources was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soviet-city-builder-game-taken-off-steam-due-to-nonsense-dmca-strike-from-rogue-fan">temporarily pulled from Steam</a> following a "nonsense" DMCA notice from an angry fan, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> studio Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-files-lawsuit-against-individuals-behind-false-destiny-copyright-takedowns">launched legal action against a disgruntled YouTuber in 2022</a>, accusing them of maliciously filing fraudulent takedown notices against other content creators in retaliation for a DMCA filing by Bungie's own team.

            <p>A senior developer who worked on Larian's much loved and critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has moved studios, and is now working with Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk studio CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>Senior developer Felix Pedulla worked at Larian for six years on the cinematic side of the team, before announcing his departure this week. He called his time at the Baldur's Gate 3 studio an "incredible" and "frankly wild" ride.</p>

<p>"I'm so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I'll forever cherish the lessons and memories," Pedulla wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M/">LinkedIn</a>. "A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made."</p>
<p>The developer has now moved to CD Projekt Red, where he will "trade in [his] <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> dice for some Polish steel" as the company's new senior cinematic designer. It's time to "get to work crafting some epic cutscenes," Pedulla closed.</p><p>While the cinematic designer did not say which of CDPR's games he would be working on, it is fair to assume that he will be lending his talents to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Just last month, it was confirmed some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">key Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 development talent had also made the jump to CD Projekt and Ciri's new adventure</a>.</p>

<p>As for The Witcher 4, its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star"> first trailer was revealed at last year's The Game Awards</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-not-at-the-game-awards-this-year">don't expect it to show up again this year</a>.</p>
<p>We got another look at the next Witcher game in-action back in June. The team did caveat though, that though that particular demo may have looked like gameplay, it was actually a representation of what the tech could do, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">wasn't actually representative of the final game</a>. The performance seen during said tech demo is what the game is aiming for, however. At this time, the studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4s-northern-setting-revealed-in-new-unreal-livestream">showed off the northern setting for The Witcher 4</a>.</p>
