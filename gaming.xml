As in Pokemon Go Fest's previous stops, Niantic will provide a curated route that will let players take in some of Paris' landmarks while keeping an eye out for elusive Pokemon. The Parc de Sceaux will have real-life Pokemon habitats where players can meet Pokemon mascots and trainers, compete head-to-head in the PVP battle ground, and shop for exclusive merchandise.</p><p>"The charm of Paris, its walkability, and its globally recognized landmarks create the perfect playground for Pokémon GO Fest," said Pokemon Go Live Events Marketing Manager Lena Cillis in a statement. "We're eager to see Trainers explore this beautiful city and the elegant Parc de Sceaux alongside France's passionate community and visitors from around the world."</p><p>Before this event, Pokemon Go Fest will visit Osaka, Japan from May 29-June 1, and Jersey City, New Jersey from June 6-8. Following Pokemon Go Fest: Paris, Ninatic will hold a Pokemon Go Fest Global event from June 28-29.</p><p>If you're looking for something to do sooner, Niantic has already shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-march-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-days-and-more/1100-6529806/" data-ref-id="1100-6529806">the Pokemon Go events for March</a>.

                <p>In WWE 2K25's new Island mode, you'll explore an open-world PvPvE hub full of shops, events, and other players. But one thing you might lose track of is how to change your character's appearance in The Island. In our brief guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that, so your future WWE superstar can look just the way you want them to. Better yet, this same method we'll show you also lets you adjust their moveset to your liking.</p><h2>How to customize your character's appearance and moves in WWE 2K25 The Island</h2><p>There's only one way to change what your character looks like in The Island, since it's a mode split off from your library of create-a-wrestlers (CAWs) and your MyRise story mode superstar. When you create your Island character, the game might usher you right past the customization suite, leaving you to need to get back to it after some brief onboarding into the new mode. </p><p>Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035"></a><figcaption>Head down the pathway you see in the image behind Larry David here...</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg"></figure><p>Head down that pathway and look to the left of Rhodes' hub. There, you'll see a kiosk called MyBooth--these 2K games love branding by removing the space between words. Interact with the circular kiosk to jump into a menu where you can change your wrestler's appearance or moves. There are other MyBooth stations around the Island, but this is the one closest to where you load into the world. Since the mode strangely lacks a map, we'll just say you can generally expect to find a MyBooth kiosk near a few of the distinct zones within the Island hub. There's another one by the Hall of Legends, for example, and another in the Temple of the Ancestors. </p><p>Everything currently available to your character will be there, and beyond the build options you chose at their creation--like their fighting style, height, and weight--nothing is untouchable, so you can continue to edit them as much as you'd like. As you see in the screenshots here, I tried making Larry David. If you see him around the Island, just leave him be. He hates a stop-and-chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036"></a><figcaption>...then interact with MyBooth to change your character's look and moveset.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg"></figure><p>For more on WWE 2K25, don't miss the full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-showcase-match-list-all-bloodline-matches-and-rewards/2900-6302/" data-ref-id="2900-6302">Showcase matches list</a>, with all rewards and unlockables detailed.

Frogwares' <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> is now live, and has smashed through its crowdfunding target in less than a day - raising over £140K at the time or writing.
</p>
<p>
As part of its crowdfunding drive, Frogwares has shared new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> details - confirming the Lovecratian sequel to be a standalone story featuring new characters and locations. It's once again set in 1920s America, but instead of revisting Oakmont, players'll this time be exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham itself.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">previously revealed</a>, The Sinking City 2 - which is Frogwares' first Unreal Engine 5 game - marks a shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor. It's a sequel firmly in survival horror territory, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around - which is perhaps a gamble given combat has historically been Frogawares' achilles heel.

<p>
Investigation work <em>does</em> return, but now it's described as an "optional yet highly useful tool", that'll help players uncover secrets, gameplay bonuses, and lore. The Sinking City 2 is also set to feature a smaller map - explorable both on foot and by boat - that's aiming to provide a "better flow and concentration of things to discover".
</p>
<p>
You'll find a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">few more details on The Sinking City 2's Kickstarter page</a>, and there's a look at some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtyEOb2IBZQ">pre-alpha gameplay</a> in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares is aiming to release The Sinking City 2 on  PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. And if you want to get involved with its crowdfunding campaign - which it says will help "essentially guarantee our team the time and resources needed to explore" new features - there's still 29 days left before things come to a close.
</p>
<p>
The Ukraine-based Frogwares successfully took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">similar crowdfunding approach with 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened,</a> as  it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion. "This financial safety net proved invaluable to us," the studio writes in its latest Kickstarter campaign, "so we need to do the same now with The Sinking City 2 as this game is vastly bigger and more complex."

<h2>Viral success (for someone else)</h2>
<p>VoltekPlay <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/comment/mg4va8a/">writes on Reddit</a> that it was only alerted to the existence of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> on iOS by "a suspicious burst of traffic on our itch.io page—all coming from Google organic search." Only after adding a "where did you find our game?" player poll to the page were the developers made aware of some <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@moonliteskye/video/7478018135375842568">popular TikTok videos</a> featuring the iOS version.</p>
<p>"Luckily, some people in the [Tiktok] comments mentioned the real game name—<em>Diapers, Please!</em>—so a few thousand players were able to google their way to our page," VoltekPlay writes. "I can only imagine how many more ended up on the thief’s App Store page instead."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the $2.99 iOS release of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> was <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6742455066?country=US&amp;tab=category_rankings">quickly climbing iOS's paid games charts</a>, attracting an estimated 20,000 downloads overall, <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/publisher/ios/1758988688/?page=1&amp;page_size=25">according to Sensor Tower</a>.</p>

<p>The App Store listing credited <em>My Baby or Not!</em> to "Marwane Benyssef," a new iOS developer with no apparent history in the game development community. Benyssef's only other iOS game, <em>Kiosk Food Night Shift</em>, was released last August and appears to be a direct copy of <em>Kiosk</em>, a pay-what-you-want title that was <a href="https://vividev.itch.io/kiosk/">posted to itch.io last year</a> (with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">subsequent "full" release on Steam</a> this year)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/someone_stole_our_game_from_itchio_renamed_it_and/">a Reddit post</a>, the team at VoltekPlay said that they had filed a DMCA copyright claim against <em>My Baby or Not!</em> Apple subsequently shared that claim with Bennysof, VoltekPlay writes, along with a message that "Apple encourages the parties to a dispute to work directly with one another to resolve the claim."</p>
<p>This morning, Ars reached out to Apple to request a comment on the situation. While awaiting a response (which Apple has yet to provide), Apple appears to have removed Benyssef's developer page and all traces of their games from the iOS App Store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/siege-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-because-somehow-it-isnt-already/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This upcoming weekend, Rainbow Six Siege will be free-to-play for all Xbox Game Pass members. If you’re like me, you might be surprised to learn that Siege, a live-service tactical shooter from Ubisoft, is not already a free-to-play game. </p>



<h2 id="h-siege-somehow-isn-t-free-to-play-after-10-years">Siege Somehow Isn’t Free-To-Play After 10 Years</h2>



<p>As part of its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/06/free-play-days-03-06-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#FreePlayDays program</a>, Rainbow Six Siege will be free to play on Game Pass, starting now until Monday, March 10. AEW: Fight Forever, Born of Bread, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown are also free-to-play during the weekend. But Siege’s inclusion is a fascinating one, because if you didn’t know any better, you’d assume that Siege was a free-to-play game already.</p>



<p>Siege hits all the characteristics of a free-to-play game. It’s a live service shooter with all the live service fixings: seasonal passes, loot boxes, a robust cosmetics shop, and dozens of operators that require vigorous grinding or premium currency to unlock. Not only does the standard edition of Rainbow Six Siege cost money, but there’s also three separate upgradeable versions: Deluxe Edition, Operator Edition, and Ultimate Edition. Now currently, there’s a Ubisoft sale on Steam, so you can get the standard version or the Deluxe Edition for less than $7. However, nowhere on the Steam store listing does it explain the differences between the versions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Way back when the game first launched in 2015, Siege struggled to bring in the numbers that Ubisoft hoped for. However, it slowly improved in player numbers as it released a wave of free content and became a shining example of how a “live service game” could flourish. By 2017, Ubisoft said Siege was attracting 2.3 million players every day. Games like Fortnite, VALORANT, and Apex Legends adopted those same live-service tendencies, but removed a huge entry barrier by releasing as free-to-play.</p>



<p>But why is Siege still not free-to-play at this point? Some players would say it keeps cheaters at bay by making them pay to get in. Maybe the pay-upfront approach is the right one, since Siege is celebrating its 10 year anniversary, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heading toward its next “major evolution” in Siege X</a>. Coincidentally , the Ubisoft sale on Steam ends on March 13, the same as the Siege X world premiere. Between that premiere and the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, it’s going to be a big month for Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Were you also surprised to learn Siege wasn’t free-to-play? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The only way Nvidia’s claim of performance parity with the 4090 even begins to make sense is by using the company’s new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation tech.<strong> </strong>It significantly boosts framerates by interpolating three frames for every one actually rendered frame. The result made <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and other games feel sluggish and subject to lots of visual artifacting while moving.</p><p>But broken CES promises are only part of the story. Outside of that context the 5070 might be a fine incremental improvement on last year’s models at a similar price. But the graphics card market right now is so chaotic and undersupplied that no one actually expects to be able to get the new budget cards at the official $550 MSRP. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-5070-was-in-stock-on-launch-day-but-at-terrible-prices&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-5070-was-in-stock-on-launch-day-but-at-terrible-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As <em>PC Mag</em> notes</a></span>, launch day stock almost immediately sold out, if it was ever really available to begin with.</p><p>The 5070 cards people could actually find for sale were $650 or more, and things will seemingly only get worse until new stock emerges. In the meantime, there are scalper listings in the $1,000s. One ray of hope is AMD’s new Radeon RX 9070 line, which has been getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-graphics-cards&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-graphics-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rave reviews so far</a></span>. It’s also selling for above the $550-600 MSRP at the moment, but seems to be less scarce overall. There’s no telling just how the broader graphics card market will shake out amid trade wars and the ongoing AI arms race, but decent competition for Nvidia can’t hurt. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

April's a busy month in the world of The Last of Us. Not only is Part 2 coming to PC, the long-awaited second season of HBO's live-action TV adaptation begins too - and Sony is squeezing into the middle of that mushroom-scented sandwich with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/first-look-at-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-the-last-of-us-limited-edition/">limited edition DualSense controller</a> themed around developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s acclaimed games.
</p>
<p>
The DualSense wireless controller – The Last of Us Limited Edition, as it's officially known, arrives on 10th April (Part 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">comes to PC on the 3rd</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">show starts on the 13th</a>), featuring "glossy trophy icons" representing key moments, characters, and events from both games.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you've been lumbered with me instead of Eurogamer's resident The Last of Us expert Victoria Kennedy for this one - so instead of an insightful breakdown explaining how all the little pictures relate to the game, my only passing thought is the black and white design and subtle embossing looks surprisingly tasteful. Not sure about those big white icons though.

<p>
Anyway, here's what Naughty Dog has to say about the whole thing: "We wanted to ensure that both instalments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognise the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part 1, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part 2."

<p>
Sony's The Last of Us DualSense controller launches on 10th April and costs £74.99 / €84.99 / $84.99. However, anyone looking to jump in line early - given the "limited quantities" it's being released in - can <a href="http://direct.playstation.com/">pre-order on the PlayStation website</a> starting at 10am, 14th March, local time.
</p>
<p>
All this The Last of Us activity comes as Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann this week warned fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">"don't bet" on there being a The Last of Us Part 3</a>.

            <p>
A year after developer Ironmace managed to get its free-to-play medieval extraction looter Dark and Darker back on digital storefronts amid a lengthy legal tussle with South Korean game company Nexon, it's been delisted again, this time from the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>
Dark and Darker's legal troubles began in 2023 (shortly after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/medieval-battle-royale-alike-dark-and-darker-is-having-a-moment-in-steam-next-fest">demo had a bit of a moment on Steam</a>) when Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-denies-stolen-code-allegations-following-police-raid">accused Ironmace of copyright infringement</a>, claiming members of the development team had used "materials and assets they worked on during their time" at Nexon to create Dark and Darker - an accusation Ironmace repeatedly denied.
</p>
<p>
As the legal accusations continued to fly, Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">issued a cease and desist order forcing the game off Steam</a>, but things appeared to be looking up for Ironmance after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-dev-says-nexons-trade-secret-and-copyright-lawsuit-against-it-has-been-dismissed">court dismissed Nexon's request for an injunction</a> last January. By March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">Dark and Darker had released on the Epic Games Store</a> and it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-is-back-on-steam-and-now-its-free-to-play">finally returned to Steam in June</a> - but it looks like the dance is beginning again, with Dark and Darker having now been removed from the Epic Games Store.
</p>

<p>
Addressing the situation in a message shared on the official Dark and Darker Discord (as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-and-darker/delisted-epic-games-store">spotted by PCGamesN</a>), developer Ironmace wrote, "The decision appears to be based on claims made by opposing parties in an ongoing legal dispute. We are currently working to understand the exact reasoning behind this removal."
</p>
<p>
"It seems that the removal process is not yet fully complete," the studio added, "as Dark and Darker is no longer listed, but Dark and Darker: Legendary Status is still available for purchase. Please be aware of this potential confusion."
</p>
<p>
Ironmace didn't explicitly name the opposing parties in its "ongoing legal dispute", but these latest developments are almost certainly connected to the studio's battle with Nexon, which reached another milestone earlier this year. In February, a South Korean court ruled Ironmace hadn't committed copyright infringement with Dark and Darker, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-sued-by-nexon-for-copyright-infringement">Nexon had argued</a> - but the studio wasn't entirely off the hook. The court also decided Ironmace <em>had</em> infringed on Nexon's trade secrets, ordering the studio to cough up around $6m USD in damages.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Nexon said it "planned to seek further legal judgment through a higher court", so there's a good chance Dark and Darker's removal from Epic is related to Nexon's escalation. We've reached out to Epic and Ironmace for comment on the situation.

  <div>
      <div><p>Today, Hero Forge launched a new Kickstarter campaign to add custom dice to their services. The aptly named Hero Forge: Custom Dice campaign has already found great success, reaching its funding goal within an hour of going live.</p>

<h2>The Hero Forge: Custom Dice Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Kickstarter campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heroforge/custom-dice/description" rel="nofollow">Hero Forge: Custom Dice</a> lets you order customized polyhedral dice for your home games. This customization is an extension of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-full-color-miniatures-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hero Forge's service</a>, printing custom miniatures of various custom characters. It is a service they have provided to tabletop players since 2014, bringing endless personalized minis to gaming tables around the world.</p>

The service can print any kind of dice: D4, D6, D10, percentile dice, D12, large or XL D20s. If you play a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a>, you can order bricks of D6s for your wargames. If you're more of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em></a> player, you can print a custom spin-down die to keep track of life totals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TechRaptor was lucky enough to get to check out some Custom Dice ahead of the Kickstarter's launch, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-custom-dice-review-perfect-dice-set-for-your-favorite-miniature" rel="nofollow">read about what works and what isn't quite there yet </a>in our review.</p>

Most cards are listed for a $100 premium over that MSRP, if not more.</p><p>Micro Center appears to be doing far better, with <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=0&amp;NTX=mode+MatchPartial&amp;NTT=9070+&amp;NTK=all&amp;sortby=pricelow">as many as five 9070s and five 9070 XTs</a> at MSRP and a website that claims they’re even still available for purchase if you visit one of its 28 US locations in person.</p><p>What happens next? It’s not unusual for each graphics card partner to sell a variety of fancier grades of the same GPU at higher prices with fancier cooling and overclocking — but retailers are now suggesting that even the prices of entry-level cards won’t hold.</p><p>“We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT […] they will apply to a limited number of cards,” wrote Swedish retailer Inet.se, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later">as documented by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>.</p><p>“MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,” UK retailer Overclockers UK also reportedly wrote.</p><p>Even Best Buy seemed to suggest that $549 / $599 prices were only temporary. When we visited this morning, the Best Buy website described them like they were on sale, though the company has since removed the “save $80” and “save $130” you see below. AMD says the Best Buy listings were an error.</p><p>We asked AMD:</p><div><ul><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that the best prices on the best-priced cards are capped in this way?</span></li><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that only a fraction of the best-priced models of 9070 and 9070 XT will be sold at their announced MSRP?</span></li><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that AMD has okayed any board partners or retailers whatsoever to raise their prices beyond MSRP after selling through a certain quantity or certain number of shipments?</span></li></ul></div><p>AMD would not confirm or deny. It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though:</p><div><blockquote><p>It is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599 (excluding region specific tariffs and / or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.</p></blockquote></div><p>On X, <a href="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1897668346298220588">Azor tweeted</a> that AMD is working to replenish stock “in the coming days and weeks,” adding, “MSRP pricing (excluding region specific tariffs and/or taxes) will continue to be encouraged beyond today so don’t despair.”</p><p><strong><em>U</em></strong><em><strong>pdate, 4:30PM ET:</strong> Added that AMD says the Best Buy listings were in error. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a time when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board games based on video games</a> are becoming commonplace, it was only a matter of time before FromSoftware’s behemoth made its way to the tabletop. Steamforged Games – creators of other major video game adaptations like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-the-board-game-series-buying-guide">Resident Evil</a>, Monster Hunter World, and FromSoftware’s Dark Souls – took up the flask to do just that. Now, after a highly successful crowdfunding campaign in 2022, Elden Ring: The Board Game (referred to as just Elden Ring going forward) is nearly in the hands of backers and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXbpk?object_uuid=59c39b23-0b80-410e-8ab6-b923b8ed768b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available for preorder</a> for everyone else.

Steamforged Games has created three of these “campaigns” for prospective Tarnished to choose from – Realm of the Grafted King, The Weeping Peninsula, and Stormveil Castle – with Grafted King serving as the larger “base game” and the other two as standalone expansions. These expansions can be tackled on their own or played after Grafted King, allowing you to carry over your characters and continue their adventure, growing ever stronger in the process. Depending on which box you purchase, you will have access to different classes, including the Vagabond, Samurai, Astrologer, and Prophet in the Grafted King (base game) box; the Hero, Prophet, Astrologer, and Bandit in Weeping Peninsula; and the Confessor, Prisoner, Samurai, and Vagabond in the Stormveil Castle box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This game is an imposing thing, arriving in large boxes filled with fearsome-looking monster miniatures, hundreds of cards, cardboard tokens, tiles, and a plethora of books containing rules, combat maps, and scenario guides. It’s one of the most intimidating games in my collection, made even more terrifying by the fact that I only own one of the campaigns – I have yet to get the other two boxes or any of the bonus boss sets that can be added in. For such a large game, Steamforged has knocked Elden Ring out of the park in terms of production value, featuring some of the most detailed miniatures I’ve seen, along with great-feeling cards and sturdy cardboard components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenarios come in a handful of varieties that do a good job of keeping things fresh, so you’re not doing the same thing back-to-back. However, not every scenario type lands as well as others. Narrative scenarios ask you to read paragraphs of story, choose different actions to take (potentially making skill checks), and then draw the appropriate card to see what happens. While these are well-written and I appreciate the inclusion of skill checks, this type of scenario didn’t do much for me – if I wanted to do a bunch of reading or storytelling, I’d simply read a book or play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By far, my favorite are Exploration scenarios, which excellently capture the spirit of discovery and the feeling of never knowing what lies beyond the next hill – something that almost defines the source material. In these scenarios, you and the other players explore a region of the map, flipping and placing random tiles as you work to complete various quests. Tiles can contain enemies, items, Sites of Grace, or other surprises for you to uncover and take advantage of. I’m a big fan of the “grow as you go” approach to map creation in board games – whether it’s in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a> or Clank! Catacombs – as it enhances both the sense of discovery and the game’s replayability due to the random nature of tile placement. These scenarios offer a balanced mix of everything Elden Ring has to offer – combat, story, and exploration – without feeling overwhelming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining three scenario types are strictly combat-focused: Gauntlet, Dungeon, and Boss scenarios. Gauntlets throw you into incredibly difficult encounters with mobs of enemies and special rules sprinkled in. Dungeons are similar but culminate in a strong boss at the end. Finally, Boss scenarios – where you and your friends square off against the game’s true threats – are the ultimate test of your builds and teamwork. Between these scenarios and the encounters you stumble upon while exploring, Elden Ring is a combat-heavy experience, which isn’t a bad thing considering that the combat is really solid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat takes place on grids formed from ring-bound notebooks included with the game. Some fights require multiple books to be laid out in a multi-page spread, creating a battlefield where players and enemies move strategically in their struggle to defeat one another. Attacks with spells and weapons have specified ranges, but depending on the row you’re standing in, players can gain additional boons – such as dealing extra damage, modifying turn order, or blocking more effectively. My friends and I frequently found ourselves deep in deliberation over positioning, trying to survive the onslaught of incoming attacks. Alas, even our best-laid plans often led to our demise – because the enemies in this game are <em>TOUGH</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basic enemies each have a card displaying their actions, with symbols indicating attack placement, movement, and other mechanics. It takes some time to get used to what all the symbols mean, but it’s manageable. Once an enemy has taken its listed actions – or passed if it can’t fulfill all the steps – its turn ends. That's straightforward and relatively easy to manage. Bosses, however, are terrifying. They have entire decks of actions, each with its own place in the initiative order. Sometimes, you get lucky and their attacks land last. Other times, they pounce on your party before you can react. It’s brutal and unforgiving, but thanks to scalable health pools based on player count, the fights never felt unfair. Every boss battle was exciting and full of tense moments where we held our breath, hoping to stagger the boss or dodge a devastating attack. Despite just being miniatures moving on a grid, the combat offers surprising depth and strategy that makes it shine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Elden Ring forgoes dice entirely, opting instead for a card-driven deck-building experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One aspect that may surprise players is that Elden Ring forgoes dice entirely, opting instead for a card-driven <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> experience. Players play cards from a deck dictated by their equipped weapons, skills, and gear. However, damage dealt and mitigated – along with special effects like Bleed – are determined by a separate Attribute deck. Different Attribute cards contain symbols representing Strength, Dexterity, and other stats, with attack and defense decks favoring certain symbols over others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character progression is a core component of campaign board games, and Elden Ring is no different. Similar to the video game, not only can you level up your class for new abilities, but you can also customize your character by swapping weapons, armor, accessories, and Attribute cards, as well as increasing overall stats through Trait cards. This is all managed via the Rune system, which functions as an equipment load limit. Your total Rune count increases as you progress in the campaign, allowing more customization. However, the tracking method is lacking – Steamforged provides small Rune cards to track your total, but they aren’t abundant enough for every player and add to the card clutter. A simple tracker, like the one used for health, would have been far more effective. As it stands, the best method is to track Runes on paper, which feels clunky. Hopefully, a better solution will emerge from the community or Steamforged itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Elden Ring’s strengths, my initial experience was frustrating – not due to the game itself, but because I started with Stormveil Castle, the third campaign. While technically a standalone expansion, it assumes your characters have completed earlier quests and starts with adjustments to gear, runes, and decks. This made it overwhelming to set up for fresh players. I strongly urge anyone interested in this game to start with Realm of the Grafted King.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Where to Buy</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXbpk?object_uuid=59c39b23-0b80-410e-8ab6-b923b8ed768b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Steamforged Games</a><em></em></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Games Based on Video Games: </h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Mar 6, 2025 8:39 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Steamforged Games has managed to adapt one of the most monumental video games of this generation, and the result is largely a success. Elden Ring: The Board Game captures the spirit of exploration, intense combat, and character progression, while maintaining the challenge fans expect. Even with its blemishes, Elden Ring pulled me in with its fantastic miniatures, engaging tactical combat, and breadth of customization. Given Steamforged’s history of supporting their games, I wouldn’t be surprised if more campaigns and expansions are on the horizon. If you have a group of board game enthusiasts – especially Elden Ring fans – this is an easy recommendation. Just start with Realm of the Grafted King. Now, get out there, Tarnished, and see what’s waiting.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Jackbox Games has been around in multiple incarnations over the past three decades thanks to its addictive party games, including You Don't Know Jack. Now, Jackbox's library of gaming titles is making the leap to smart TVs, courtesy of the new Jackbox app.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/jackbox-coming-to-your-smart-tv-for-free" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jackbox Games' official site</a>, the company announced that the app is a result of a partnership with Amazon Web Services GameLift Streams, which will utilize the cloud to launch Jackbox's titles on smart TVs and other platforms.</p><p>While the announcement doesn't mention any specific titles that will be included, it does note that the Jackbox app "will offer a small collection of ad-supported games for free." The company indicated that it plans to eventually offer the full catalogue of Jackbox Games titles as a subscription service, but didn't offer any hints as to how much that would cost or when it might come to fruition. Jackbox also suggested that the app could be headed to additional platforms if it gets a favorable response.</p><p>Jackbox also jokingly mentioned that the app could theoretically be used on a smartwatch before adding that "gathering around your watch for a game of Fibbage is super-dumb." The Jackbox app beta is expected to be available on smart TV platforms this spring.</p><p>One of the most recent Jackbox releases was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-jackbox-game-is-a-silly-take-on-family-feud/1100-6526726/" data-ref-id="1100-6526726">The Jackbox Survey Scramble</a>, an updated take on Family Feud. Like its spiritual predecessor, The Jackbox Survey Scramble uses real surveys to come up with some off-the-wall responses that players attempt to guess. It seems like this game could be ideal for the Jackbox app, especially if the service can support online multiplayer. But for now, we can only guess about which titles will debut on the app first. </p>
