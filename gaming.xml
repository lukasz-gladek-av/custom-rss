            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bots keep players from waiting "possibly forever" to get into games.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield lead producer David Sirland has taken to social media to clear the air about how Battlefield Studios uses bots in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer to keep players engaged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s latest entry in the Battlefield series notoriously uses bots to populate standard matches that struggle to fill teams with real-world players. It’s led to some confusion in the community, as fans attempt to grasp when, how, and why BF Studios has been implementing them in online matches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986035968592204179" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X/Twitter</a> to shed light on bots, explicitly calling attention to “confusion” in the player base that he hopes to clear up. The thread of posts comes with an explanation for why some may see more bots than others, as well as the promise that EA and BF Studios will continue listening to feedback from Battlefield 6 multiplayer fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have noticed bots in standard multiplayer playlist options, especially for game modes with large lobbies like Conquest, since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10. EA proudly touted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch"><u>it had managed to sell 7 million copies</u></a> in just three days, leaving many to wonder why they are being tossed into bot-filled matches less than one month after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland explains that players should only find themselves fighting against Battlefield 6 bots in unique situations. Specifically, if the pre-round waiting period takes longer than about three minutes, than bots will be introduced as a last resort, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be forced to work with dozens of AI teammates for the duration of a 30-minute Conquest match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At that point, the game starts, and you can play with the bots instead of waiting,” Sirland explains. “Other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist - will join this server (as it has you on it). Each time a player joins, a bot leaves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sacrifice that gets players into a match with as little waiting as possible at the cost of filling a lobby with real people. Even if bots only temporarily fill a match, it sounds like BF Studios prefers the trade, with the alternative being wait times that could last forever for servers with low population.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">2: you see no other players<br>Well, the reason for that is you are first. You need to stick it out (or atleast give it a minute or two, or how may you are willing to try and wait for)<br>We can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in, but please spread the word!</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986037104405582136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986037656707342653" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>exception to the rule</u></a> that sees bots eventually traded out for real players involves beginner playlists, such as Initiation Breakthrough. As made clear via an in-game mode description, bots will stick around in these matches to help players warm up for the typically more tense matches filled with real people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bots have remained a hot topic for the Battlefield 6 community for months, with BF Studios having addressed concerns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-increases-xp-gain-addresses-progression-complaints-and-targets-xp-farms-taking-up-server-space">regarding XP farms</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-clarifies-use-of-bots-in-the-open-beta-insists-theyre-only-in-the-training-grounds-playlists">open beta bots</a> mutliple times in the past. Battlefield Portal fans and multiplayer playlist regulars have almost certainly encountered bots at some point, and many will no doubt continue to have their complaints as post-launch development continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like I stated in this thread earlier today - bots are only there to seed servers so they start,” Sirland said in response to a fan who expressed concern about the bot system. “The alternative would be no server under those circumstances. We will of course check for issues here too, and when and if servers spawn in the wrong way or when they shouldn’t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team at EA and BF Studios has continued listening to fan feedback as post-launch development continues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to hold firm high up the leaderboards on almost every platform since being released on October 30. The third-person extraction shooter has proven to be a refreshing change of pace for many fans of the genre, introducing a post-apocalyptic landscape that encourages social interaction and collaboration rather than mindless combat.</p>



<p>It’s a sensational title that has proven it can hold its own against the titans of the genre, so much so that it has managed to earn high enough ratings to become the top-rated <span>multiplayer<strong>-only</strong></span><strong> </strong>shooter in almost ten years.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-the-shooter-of-the-decade">ARC Raiders is the Shooter of the Decade</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has stumped up <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Metascore of 87</a>, which is admirable for a new IP created by a relatively young studio whose debut game earned a Metascore of 80. In terms of Metacritic alone, ARC Raiders is now the highest-rated multiplayer-exclusive shooter to hit the market in almost a decade.</p>



<p>It’s topped only by Overwatch (2016), which earned a Metascore of 91 and has a similar operating model in that it <strong>only </strong>accommodates multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p>If it weren’t for Overwatch, ARC Raiders would be lining up to be the highest-rated multiplayer-only shooter <strong>to ever be released</strong>. It’s topped in the shooter categories by games that came before, like Halo 2 (95), Gears of War (94), and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (94), but they’re all games that feature other modes and elements, including single-player campaigns.</p>



<p>With a Metascore of 87, ARC Raiders is on par with some truly heavy hitters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>



<li>Subnautica</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li>



<li>Batman: Arkham Knight</li>



<li>Forza Motorsport 6</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>



<li>Halo Infinite</li>



<li>Kingdom Hearts II</li>



<li>Fallout 4</li>



<li>Silent Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders also shines in the ‘User Score’ rating on Metacritic. At the time of publishing, ARC Raiders boasted a User Score of 8.9, which is <strong>glowing</strong>. That aligns it with games like Metal Gear Solid, Max Payne, Resident Evil, Half-Life, StarCraft, A Link Between Worlds, Bloodborne, Portal 2, and Mass Effect 2, to name just a few games.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has created something truly special in ARC Raiders, and as the studio plans to support the game for the next ten years, it’s likely it’ll be evolving for some time to come.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/david-jaffe-god-of-war-creator-xbox-grave-joke/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98this-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-god-of-war-creator%E2%80%99s-graveyard-joke-draws-criticism.1345294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, a user on social media uploaded an image of their father’s grave, recalling memories of being bought their first Xbox and falling in love with gaming. By way of a tribute to that, the user had placed two Xbox controllers on the grave, saying that their late father could ‘play along from up there’.</p>



<p>David Jaffe, the creator of God of War and Twisted Metal, quoted the post and wrote ‘This is an XBOX’, echoing Microsoft’s recent marketing campaign and prompting many to criticize the developer for an ill-timed and inappropriate comment.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-david-jaffe-mocking-the-deceased">Was David Jaffe Mocking the Deceased?</h2>



<p>The recent post on social media by David Jaffe has not been met with a positive sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Jaffe was most recently in the news for uploading a YouTube video explaining that Connie Booth, a 34-year veteran of Sony, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/connie-booth-was-fired-from-playstation-its-claimed/">was <strong>fired </strong>out of the blue</a>.</p>



<p>Under the graveyard post on social media, Jaffe attempted to defend his position after gamers came for him, but his response just stoked the flames further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Oh shut up, you f***ing babies. My parents are dead as well, it sucks. And even WHEN they died- my dad died on Halloween and you can BET we laughed about it- we tried to accept and grieve and mourn and at the same time we didn’t become a bunch of overly serious assholes<a href="https://x.com/davidscottjaffe/status/1986283772808138817"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments under the post cast aspersions, and while some understood that Jaffe might have meant something different, most bagged on his timing and the nature of his comment.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘How desperate for attention are you?’ While another said, ‘Just because you made fun of your dad dying, it does not give you the right to do it to other people, you stinky loser.’</p>



<p>Do you think David Jaffe was in the wrong for what he said? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>OpTic is preparing to <strong>finally release </strong>this year’s edition of The Process, a feature-length documentary detailing the ascension of OpTic Texas in this year’s Call of Duty League and Esports World Cup tournaments.</p>



<p>It has been a long time coming, with fans sitting on the edges of their seats eagerly awaiting the drop. It has been more than four months since OpTic Texas won back-to-back CDL Championship trophies, and mere weeks later went on to win big at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-trust-the-process">Trust The Process</h2>



<p>In a graphic uploaded on social media, the OpTic team revealed that The Process will be released on November 11. OpTic Roger later noted that the construction of the project was something monumental:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely appreciate the patience people have had for this project. I’ve sunk a countless amount of time into this movie and it getting the extra time made a difference. </p>



<p>18TB of footage all condensed into a 3 hour monster of a documentary. </p>



<p>Excited for you all to watch</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas won the Call of Duty League Championship in Canada in June, becoming the first team in COD esports history to claim back-to-back world titles. It came after a horrendous season that saw OpTic secure a historic losing streak, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/">failing to secure a map win</a> in <strong>eighteen attempts</strong>.</p>



<p>It was a horrific scene that had fans baulking at the squad’s prospects for the season, but a rejig of the roster seemed to turn things around when needed, and OpTic Texas stormed through the bracket at COD Champs.</p>



<p>I caught up with OpTic Texas in Kitchener during the Call of Duty League Championship, and Shotzzy, one of the team’s superstar players, informed me that winning at COD Champs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-shotzzy-completely-wash-year-champs/">would ‘wash the year’</a> of all the negativity.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Consider the year well and truly washed clean.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fired Rockstar Workers To Protest Outside Take-Two’s London Office Today]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fired-rockstar-workers-to-protest-outside-take-two%E2%80%99s-london-office-today.1345279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, it was revealed that around thirty Rockstar Games employees were fired by the company, under claims that the workers were participating in leaks and prohibited discussions about the development of GTA 6. Those dismissed by the company insist they were let go because they were unionizing.</p>



<p>In a bid to rebel, the IWGB, a UK-based workers’ union, has arranged a protest outside Take-Two’s London office, due to kick off today at 8 AM UK time.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-you-had-to-do-was-follow-the-law">All You Had to Do Was Follow The Law</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to social media, the IWGB Union explained the lay of the land, telling how Rockstar Games had ‘betrayed’ the employees let go for unionizing.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar, makers of GTA, have crossed the red line. They’ve fired over 30 members of staff, all IWGB Union members, in a blatant act of union busting. They’ve done this for no other reason but to try to terrify and silence staff.</p>



<p>Not only is this illegal, but this is also a complete attack on workers’ rights and peoples’ well-being.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on the development of the much-awaited GTA 6, Rockstar have chosen to take on the role of their classic game villains by breaking labor laws and firing hard-working staff making the game, betraying both workers and fans alike.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, the IWGB has arranged a protest to take place outside Take-Two’s London office later this morning.</p>

</div></figure>







<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that the employees were dismissed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for leaking information</a> about Grand Theft Auto 6 on a ‘public forum’, but many have pointed out the coincidence that every employee let go is a member of the IWGB Union.</p>



<p>The situation has drawn a mixed response from social media users, with some suggesting that ‘they must have done something wrong’. Others backing the fired employees have suggested they sue or arrange a class action lawsuit against Rockstar Games and Take-Two.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, the IWGB protest will go ahead this morning in London.</p>

<p>If we find out anything else about this first game update for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, we'll let you know. And if you want to learn more about this new Hyrule Warriors game, check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</p>

<p>Sony’s Resident Evil film looks to be taking place in Raccoon City, according to set photos. Additionally, it seems to be taking place during winter, if all the snow is an undead giveaway. </p>



<p>Directed by smash hit Weapons’ Zach Cregger, Resident Evil is set to be the next big video game adaptation. With its release on September 18th, 2026, there’s a lot riding on the title in celebration of the game’s 30th anniversary. While we know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-film-cast-severance-emmys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s in the cast</a>, story details have been quite surface-level. What we did know is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it wouldn’t be an adaptation</a>, but take from the games. Well, according to new set photos of the film in Prague, it’s taking a whole city with it.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FIRST LOOK: Zach Cregger’s RESIDENT EVIL has transformed Prague into a snowy Raccoon City, filming large-scale action sequences with gunfire, explosions, and stunt driving. 🧟‍♂️🎥</p><p>📺 RE Movie Details: <a href="https://t.co/RSwZ1e2Pzk">https://t.co/RSwZ1e2Pzk</a><br>📅 Release Date: Sept 18, 2026<br>🔍 Source: The Prague… <a href="https://t.co/FGBTRPq9hj">pic.twitter.com/FGBTRPq9hj</a></p></div>— RESIDENCE of EVIL (@ROEnetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/ROEnetwork/status/1985670620508463237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2025/11/3/photos-resident-evil-blankets-pragues-karlin-neighborhood-in-snow-for-key-action-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Prague Reporter</a>, <strong>filming has begun on the Resident Evil film</strong> in the Karlin district. The outlet was able to get photos on-set and reveals some interesting details about the shoots. For one, it seems the town <strong>will serve as Raccoon City</strong>, as one photo <strong>shows a map of the town and bus decals</strong>. Police cars with Colorado plates are also visible, indicating <strong>its version will not technically be in the Midwest</strong>. In addition, everything is covered in artificial snow, meaning the film will, in some way, <strong>take place during Winter</strong>.</p>



<p>The outlet <a href="https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2025/11/3/photos-resident-evil-blankets-pragues-karlin-neighborhood-in-snow-for-key-action-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also reports</a> that <strong>action scenes involving fast cars and explosions were filmed</strong> in the area. Residents there were told that filming would take place from 3 pm to 3 am from October 29th to November 2nd. The night is a fairly common element of Resident Evil, so the film looks to go all in with it. Given its upcoming release, we could see more information revealed before the year’s end. Still, the addition of Raccoon City is sure to be of note, given that a majority of titles, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-2-has-been-turned-into-an-arcade-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3, take place there. Perhaps we’ll see some familiar faces with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-will-not-feature-leon-kennedy-director-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon</a> and Jill? We’ll just have to wait and see.</p>

              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage creates instant panic and wastes hours of your day retracing steps or tearing apart your house. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem by turning everyday items into trackable objects through the <em>Find My</em> network. A single AirTag usually costs $29 but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings a 4-pack down to $64 from the usual $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker instead of $29.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How AirTags Work in Real Life</h2>
<p>Each <strong>AirTag pairs with your iPhone or iPad with just a tap</strong> during setup, and immediately shows up in the Find My app amongst the rest of your Apple devices. An integrated speaker plays a sound whenever you trigger it through the app to help you locate items that are wedged between the couch cushions or deep in your bag. You can also ask Siri where your keys or wallet are, and the associated AirTag will start to beep-beep-beeping without your needing to open any apps.</p>



<p>The real magic happens when your item leaves Bluetooth range which extends about 30 feet in open space. Apple’s Find My network leverages hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the world that anonymously detect nearby AirTags and report their location back to you in a crowdsourced way. This kind of tracking works passively in the background on other people’s devices without them knowing or needing to do anything.</p>



<p>Lost Mode is the feature that turns on when you mark an item as missing in the Find My app. Immediately,<strong> the AirTag will alert you when any device in the Find My network detects it</strong>, and that provides real-time updates on where the item might be. You can also include a phone number with the AirTag, allowing a person who finds your lost item simply to tap their iPhone or any other NFC-capable smartphone on it and display your contact information to get in touch with you to return it.</p>
<p>The sharing feature lets <strong>up to five people track a single AirTag</strong>, which is perfect for household items that multiple family members use. Your partner can locate the shared car keys just as easily as you can, and everyone gets notifications if the item gets left behind. Each AirTag runs on a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts about a year before needing replacement, and the Find My app notifies you when the battery runs low. The<strong> trackers are rated IP67 for water and dust resistance</strong> which means they survive splashes and brief submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $16 per AirTag in this 4-pack versus $29 individually, you’re getting the coverage you actually need at a price that makes sense.</p>

              <p>Most people can’t justify dropping $2,000 on a laptop, especially when reliable performance for basic tasks like browsing, video calls, and document work will suffice. That’s where HP’s 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop hits (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), right between capability and affordability: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">it’s selling for $626, slashed from its usual price of $1,999</a>. That’s a discount of $1,373 that brings professional-grade specs within reach, and HP sweetens the deal even further with $299 worth of bonus accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built for Everyday Computing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i3-1315U processor brings six cores to the table: performance cores for handling demanding tasks and efficiency cores for managing background processes. This 12th-generation chip reaches speeds up to 4.5GHz when you need some extra power.</p>



<p>That 32GB of DDR4 RAM is the real game-changer here: Most budget laptops ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you to close applications constantly to avoid lag. This much memory future-proofs the machine by ensuring that it stays fast as software becomes more demanding over the course of several years.</p>
<p>With 1TB SSD storage, you can install your operating system, applications, photos, and videos including a music library without having to go through the inconvenience of deleting files or managing external drives. Solid-state drives load Windows and applications in seconds, while old-school hard drives take minutes.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD screen adds intuitive interaction to your daily workflow. You can tap icons, swipe through photos, pinch to zoom in documents, and scroll through web pages with your fingers. Touch makes Windows 11 feel more natural and instinctive, especially for creative tasks or casual browsing. The HD resolution provides clear text and snappy images for spreadsheets, presentations, and video playback, even if it’s not quite as crisp as Full HD screens on pricier models.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro which gives you access to features you don’t find in any Home edition, such as BitLocker encryption to keep sensitive files safe, Remote Desktop to access your laptop from elsewhere, and enhanced security tools designed for business. Thanks to fast charging technology, it gets your battery back to practical levels in a short time and minimizes any downtime when working on the go.</p>
<p>The <strong>$299 accessory kit that accompanies this deal</strong> throws in some practical extras, such as a laptop sleeve to keep it protected on the go, a wireless mouse for easier navigation, and other niceties that would cost you extra otherwise. For $626, this HP laptop gets you the specs and features most people actually need without the premium price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, over 30 developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">were fired from Rockstar Games</a>. A trade labor group claims the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> studio was union busting, but Rockstar Games now claims the employees were leaking sensitive information. The dispute comes just as the long-awaited blockbuster is getting ready to ship in May 2026.</p> <p>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,” a Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the nature of the confidential information that was allegedly disclosed.</p> <p>The ex-Rockstar developers were in a private message group on Discord with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) when they were fired last week for what parent company Take-Two called at the time “gross misconduct.” The IWGB has been seeking to organize developers across various UK-based gaming studios, including <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/"><em>Disco Elysium</em> maker ZA/UM</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><em>MindsEye</em> maker Build a Rocket Boy</a>.</p>

 <p>“Management are showing they don’t care about delays to <em>GTA 6</em>, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game,” IWGB president Alex Marshall told <em>Bloomberg</em> in response to Rockstar’s new allegations. He maintained the fired employees were only discussing issues related to “exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.”</p> <p>The IWGB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date has already slipped once and some are <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/gta-6-launch-postponed">placing bets</a> that it could miss the new May 26 release date as well. The game has had one of the most secretive development cycles of any major blockbuster, outside of the details leaked in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">an unprecedented hack</a> back in 2022. Since then, Rockstar has only released two official trailers.</p>

<p>Following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 in October, Game Freak has now rolled out Version 1.0.2.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese website for the game, this update contains bug fixes tied to Mega Evolutions, side missions and "other issues", and also makes some adjustments to ranked battles. Here's the rundown courtesy of a rough translation, and if we get hold of the English patch notes, we'll update this post.</p>
<h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A - Version 1.0.2 (6th November 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>The following bugs have been fixed:</strong></p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59wlrhxs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>If you have not opened the box screen since the box was full before the first Mega Evolution battle, you will definitely fail to capture a Pokemon. Also, if you proceed with a side mission that allows you to obtain a Pokemon in that state, you will not be able to complete it.</li>
<li>In some side missions, if the day/night change occurs at the same time that a skill is hit on a target, it will no longer be possible to hit the target with a skill, and the side mission will no longer be able to progress.</li>
<li>During a trainer battle, if the opposing trainer switches Pokemon and the player simultaneously Mega Evolves, the opposing trainer will not be able to send out a Pokemon and will be unable to proceed.</li>
<li>Fixed some other issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rank Battle Balance Adjustments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustment of points earned based on ranking so that points are not reduced depending on the outcome of the match.</li>
<li>Some battle rewards that can be received for each battle have been added and increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>*The latest update data is required to play online features.<br>
*Local communication is not compatible with previous versions. Please make sure that you and the people you play with have the same update data version.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-begins-black-friday-with-70-off-this-1tb-ssd-windows-laptop-prime-gets-nearly-2-300-off.1345186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually, finding a laptop that powers everything without slowing down means spending serious money. Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop rewrites that equation completely: This machine packs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">professional-grade specs into a package that now costs $995, down from its typical $3,299 price tag</a>. That is a <strong>$2,304 discount</strong> that brings enterprise-level performance within reach of students and anyone tired of their sluggish laptop holding them back.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Workload</h2>
<p>Inside is an Intel Core 7 150U processor that drives this machine up to 5.4 GHz across 10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. This hybrid architecture essentially means the laptop knows when to unleash full power for demanding tasks and when to dial back for basic browsing, really maximizing both speed and battery life.</p>
<p>The 12 threads enable the processor to juggle multiple operations at one time, so you can render a video while downloading files and streaming music without watching everything grind to a halt.<strong> Intel’s Core 7 also includes dedicated CPU, GPU, and NPU engines</strong> that accelerate AI-powered features in Windows 11.</p>



<p>That <strong>32GB of DDR5 memory</strong> makes a tangible difference in daily use. DDR5 is the latest memory standard that’s faster and more power-efficient than older DDR4. You can have 50 browser tabs open, run Adobe Creative Suite applications and have Spotify playing in the background, then jump between everything in an instant. The 1TB SSD provides ample room for your operating system without needing to constantly manage space or use external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen display runs at a 1920×1200 resolution</strong>, and provides more space vertically than the standard 1920×1080 screens. Those extra 120 pixels make spreadsheets easier to read and mean less scrolling when working with documents. With its 300-nit brightness, the screen can stay visible in bright rooms or near windows, and its anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections that cause eye strain during long work sessions. The touchscreen adds intuitive interaction: pinch fingers to zoom in on photos, swipe through documents, and navigate Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface with your fingers.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include: USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports for legacy peripherals, including mice and external hard drives; a Thunderbolt 4 port that enables 40Gbps data transfer to drives and enables the driving of high-resolution external monitors; an HDMI port suitable for presentations and second screens; and a universal audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>With this Dell Inspiron laptop, performance that would normally cost three times more is available for 70% off.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games says it didn’t fire employees for attempting to form a union. Rather, the studio behind Grand Theft Auto 6 says that staff let go were done so for leaking company information.</p>



<p>In a new report from Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, the employees were giving out company secrets in a forum with non-Rockstar staff. This led to more than 30 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p><strong>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,”</strong> a Rockstar spokesperson told Schreier. <strong>“This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-was-the-union-s-response">What Was The Union’s Response?</h2>



<p>It just so happens, however, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone who was let go</a> also took park in a private union chat on Discord. The only people outside of Rockstar involved in the chat, they say, were labor organizers.</p>



<p>The president of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain, Alex Marshall, said that Rockstar was simply <strong>“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to&nbsp;GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive for comment on the situation. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In the meantime, Take-Two Interactive is preparing for its latest quarterly earnings report on November 6.</p>

I didn't set out to replace all my free time with grinding its roguelite take on Breakout, but its reliance on strategy (with a butterfly kiss of luck) and enticing upgrade paths both on and off the playfield grabbed a hold of the primal lizard parts of my brain to the detriment of all other civilized activity. I am <em>hooked</em>. In fact, Ball x Pit is the only video game I've played since I first started it a couple weeks ago. I cannot break free from its satisfying loop of running a level and upgrading my balls, upgrading my city to unlock more balls, and then jumping right back in. It's a sickness, a sickness with no cure – and, honestly… I'm not even sure I'd want to be healed from the madness that has taken hold of me. I’ve been recommending it to everyone and, so far, those who have taken my advice inevitably reach out to tell me the same thing: "You ruined my life, you sicko." It’s fantastic. Join us. We all bounce down here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a distance, Ball x Pit looks like one of those crappy games you see advertised on TikTok or Reels. You know the ones: "We're playing a game the comments said was fake part 17," or something like that. At first blush, it does look like some endless runner game trying to hook you with playtime gems or whatever predatory garbage is in vogue these days. But, crucially, it’s <em>not</em> one of those games at all, as it’s entirely free of microtransactions and actually respects your time as it vacuums it all up. It doles out satisfying upgrades in each level and then gives you the opportunity to build up more permanent powers in your home base. There's nothing cheap or underhanded about it. It makes you feel powerful, not cheated, and even with an element of RNG in each level, it requires you to make the most out of every opportunity rather than rely on dumb luck or random chance. When you beat a level, it feels like you earned it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual gameplay seems straightforward on the surface, too: Your character, or characters, march up the playfield firing bouncing balls at wave after wave of enemies. The balls are weaponized, the enemies are crushed under the onslaught, and eventually you get to a given level’s unique boss. That's the basic loop, but the operative word there is "basic." Because, friends, Ball x Pit is much more complex. For starters, there are different kinds of balls to fire. For example, your initial character, the Warrior, starts with a special ball that imparts a "bleed" status effect that stacks up to cause extra damage on successive hits. As you defeat enemies, you’ll also pick up gems in order to level up, which then gives you a choice of balls and other power-ups to use during that specific run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are special balls with status effects or area-of-effect damage, balls that spawn more "baby balls" (weird), and loads of other options. Then there are buffs, passive effects, defensive boosts, and even allies who'll join you in the march forward, dealing out damage or even health. Some of the power ups are much better than others. The Earthquake ball, for example, deals damage around the enemy it hits and, like most of the AOE balls, becomes incredibly powerful when fully upgraded. Others, like the Wretched Onion, kind of suck. Part of the fun is finding out which upgrades work best in any given level, as well as discovering what happens when you combine certain balls with Fusions and Evolutions that mix or modify their powers even further.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you're fully powered up and the RNG gods have held you in their favor, it's a beautiful bloodbath.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fusions can simply save you a slot by mashing two effects onto a single ball, but specific combos instead get the chance to evolve into a new power. For example, fusing the Horizontal Laser with the Vertical Laser creates my personal favorite, the Holy Laser. It shoots beams of pure fiery death vertically <em>and </em>horizontally on hit while also dealing AOE damage, which is as useful much as it just rules. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s cool that fusing balls both scales the damage you are dealing and gives you room to add even more. It's hard to keep track of all the possibilities, but there's an in-game encyclopedia that shows you the combos you've unlocked. I'm more than 30 hours in and I still have fusions I haven't found yet, which I find pretty damn exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, the laser balls in any configuration do a crap-ton of damage, searing rows and columns, sometimes adding stackable status effects like radiation while also doing normal, hot laser damage. When you're fully powered up and the RNG gods have held you in their favor, it's a beautiful bloodbath. Lasers and explosions and effects are going off constantly, and the damage counters fill the screen as entire rows of enemies evaporate into experience gems, as well as gold you’ll spend back in your town between runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The town is the other half of Ball x Pit, one that's enormously important to growing your characters. In addition to earning permanent stat boosts just by playing as them, constructing certain buildings and character houses will provide buffs and bonuses as well, which you’ll absolutely need in order to make it through the later levels. But while it’s very important, the city-building part of Ball x Pit is extremely clunky – in fact, it’s probably the worst part of what I think is otherwise a flawless game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete a level, whether or not you did so successfully, you're thrown back into the town interface where you’ll build structures from blueprints you gathered out in the field. You also build resource tiles: forests for wood, fields for wheat, and rocks for… well, rocks. Those resources, in addition to gold, are required to build and upgrade new structures. Thankfully there are plenty of ways to gather resources outside of just harvesting, including during runs and with passive buildings like the stone quarry, but collecting it manually is the most fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the harvest phase, you use your unlocked characters as balls, taking aim from the bottom of the board and letting them rip, Beyblade style, in the direction of the stuff you want to hit. They then bounce off the walls and buildings, collecting resources from the resource tiles and upgrading any buildings you marked for improvement. This process is amusing but also fairly tedious, as you can move buildings around before you harvest in order to optimize their placement, but there isn’t really a convenient way to do so. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>City building is the worst part of an otherwise a flawless game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What I usually end up doing is moving everything off to one side of the map, then shuffling all the parts and pieces back again to where I want them at that specific moment. It almost seems like Ball x Pit is aware of how cumbersome the city building is, because there's no penalty or resource cost for moving tiles around. What I'd love to see is some kind of option to wipe the slate clean without needing to go through and manually remove every building, or maybe a holding pen where I could drop structures temporarily while I reconfigure my layout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you will be reconfiguring your layout a lot. Building upgrades require your characters to bounce off the buildings multiple times, and if that building is in a weird location, good luck getting the trajectory right to consistently hit it enough times during the harvest phase without reorganizing half the town. I often ended up moving relevant buildings down near the launch area, which meant moving all the other stuff away… and then reorganizing it again after all is said and done. I don't like it at all. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Seth's Game DNA</h3><p>These are the games that made me the gamer I game game game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's such a bummer because you can’t really ignore this, as city layout is extremely important to how powerful you are in the levels themselves. Some buildings provide buffs that make the effects of other nearby buildings stronger, so their placement is crucial to your continued success. That need for careful planning is at odds with the reality of constantly shuffling tiles around when it comes time to harvest, build, and upgrade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, building-specific issues aside, I do really like how your town structures contribute directly to the action itself. The better your city, the better your characters, and the more blueprints you find, the more options you have when it comes to a new run. It may be cumbersome to move everything around, but the results are meaningful and can sometimes be surprising in a way that is ultimately a positive. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Double Down on Strategy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Somewhat early on, you unlock a building that lets you bring two characters into battle instead of just one, adding another layer of complexity and experimentation to each run. At first, it almost feels like cheating, but it would be functionally impossible to get much further without it. I'm still figuring out which combinations work well and which ones are total crap. Since you still gain gold and experience even on a failed run, I don't even mind when I pick a total dud combo because I've still made some progress. There have also been several times where I thought I'd figured out some god-tier combo, only to get three-quarters of the way through a level and realize I have made a terrible mistake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The worst was when I paired The Warrior with The Flagellant for a New Game+ run of the first level. Balls shot by the Flagellant bounce off the bottom of the screen instead of the top, and The Warrior has no special attributes other than being your starting character. The first level boss, the Skeleton King, requires hits to the back of its skull to inflict damage. The RNG gods had graced me with some decent fusions, but all of them ended up bouncing harmlessly between his two arms out front, leaving me almost completely ineffective. An errant baby ball would sometimes bank off the wall to register a tiny amount of damage, but I ended up losing on purpose just to back out of the level.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As frustrating as that was, it's emblematic of something I love about Ball x Pit: it requires strategy in almost every facet. The balls and upgrades offered to you are at the mercy of RNG, sure, but you also have the choice of which ones to use and which ones to fuse and evolve. I was able to identify good combinations and bad combinations of characters based on their attributes and would make mental notes about which pairings would work out for my specific needs as I pushed through each level. The Juggler, for example, throws balls over enemies – pairing him with The Shade, whose balls shoot from the back of the field, and then following a heavy AOE upgrade path allowed me to clear out basically any row of enemies on the board while still getting a ton of damage from balls bouncing in the back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That combination of strategy and knowing how to best upgrade any given character combination for a specific level is what keeps bringing me back, over and over again, until I'm bleary eyed and tired. When everything aligns and you're wiping out entire fields of enemies, when the screen is absolutely filled with lasers and explosions and baby balls scattering in every direction, you feel an enormous sense of power. From an outside view, honing in your upgrades combined with careful building placement and frequent stat leveling from buff buildings makes it seem like Ball x Pit would feel easier over time. But it does a rare thing: instead of feeling easy, it makes you feel powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I finally did beat the main story and watched the credits around the 20-hour mark, I immediately started up New Game+. I never do that. But the entirely inconsequential story is just a small part of Ball x Pit for me. The real joy here comes from building up your powers and combos and seeing what delights will unlock themselves during the course of a run. I play for moments when the music is nearly drowned out by the sounds of explosions and laser blasts, or when I get a gold bonus for clearing the field of enemies and then doing it two, three, even five more times in a given level. It scratches an itch deep within my lizard brain. Hard work pays off, but the right combinations of upgrades mixed in with a touch of luck pays off even more.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Ball x Pit is my favorite game of 2025. Even with a clunky city building phase you can’t afford to ignore, the actual action of its Breakout-inspired runs is enormously fun. I get stuck in a "just one more run" mindset every time I sit down to play what I swear is going to be a quick round or two. Its strategies run surprisingly deep for a simple brick-breaker, rewarding smart planning and forethought more so than RNG and luck alone. It's a rare game that I’m still excited to play well after I beat the main story and, in a lot of ways, I wish I were playing it right now. If you want your life to be completely upended by a seemingly simple brick-breaking roguelite, I cannot recommend it enough.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ball-x-pit-review]]></content:encoded>

And while the majority of what you find while scavenging topside will be useful materials and weapons, you'll also occasionally come across items that are designed to be sold for some extra cash.

But they're not all created equally.</p><p>Trinkets come in four rarities: Common (White), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), and Epic (Purple). While there is occasionally variation between selling prices even among trinkets of the same rarity, these identifiers help to give you an idea of whether you've stumbled upon something truly special or not, with higher-tier items typically bringing in a bigger chunk of change.</p><p>In addition to being a way to rake in more money, a few trinkets also have uses back in Speranza.

              <p>Apple doesn’t usually advertise big discounts on its own website but the company quietly drops deals through Amazon from time to time. The MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage (which launched in March 2025) is no exception to this pattern. For the first time ever, a MacBook Air this recent is getting a serious price cut just months after its release: We saw it hit $799 during Prime Day, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings it down to $749 which marks a brand new all-time low from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>

<h2>The Right MacBook for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>This is no ordinary laptop refresh: The 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip is <strong>Apple’s first consumer machine built from scratch for Apple Intelligence</strong>, the suite of AI-powered features transforming how you’ll interact with your Mac. The <strong>Retina display on this 13.6-inch gadget</strong> shows sharp text and brilliant colors at a resolution of 2560×1664, with 500 nits of brightness that makes everything from spreadsheets to Netflix binges look crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Beneath the cool Midnight aluminum chassis, you’ll find 16 GB of unified memory: <strong>That’s double what Apple offered in the base models</strong> until recently. That matters because unified memory is a little different from traditional RAM. It’s shared between the CPU and GPU so that both have instant access to the same pool of fast memory, without having to copy data back and forth. What this practically means is that you can keep dozens of browser tabs open, edit large photos, run many apps at once, and get zero slowdown. The 256GB SSD storage offers you enough room for your OS, most essential apps and a solid collection of files.</p>
<p>The M4 chip itself is a beast for everyday computing and <strong>touts an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU on a 3-nanometer process</strong> that handle everything from web browsing up to light video editing without breaking a sweat. You get up to 18 hours of web browsing and up to 15 hours of video playback from one charge, which means you really can work all day long without having to hunt down an outlet. The<strong> chip also contains a 16-core Neural Engine</strong> that’s exclusively designed to accelerate machine learning tasks, powering features such as real-time language translation, advanced photo editing and Apple Intelligence capabilities.</p>



<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera sits centered above the display and keeps you in frame during video calls: As you move around, the camera pans and zooms to follow you, making remote meetings feel more natural and professional. Touch ID is integrated into the keyboard, allowing you to unlock your Mac, authenticate purchases, and switch between user accounts using only your fingerprint<strong>. Two Thunderbolt USB 4 ports provide transfer speeds up to 40Gbps</strong>, support for external displays up to 6K resolution, as well as fast charging.</p>
<p>Weighing in at just 2.7 pounds and 0.44 inches thin, the MacBook Air slips into any bag without adding noticeable weight to your daily carry.</p>
<p>And you’re getting a machine at $749 that should stay relevant for years to come, with Apple’s history of providing software updates for seven years or more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Google unveiled its latest and greatest Pixel 10 in August this year, but last year’s Pixel 9 is still a great option to invest in if you’re looking to upgrade. In fact, with prices on newer models climbing higher, the Pixel 9 is looking like one of the better value buys you can get right now, especially with the current drop.</span></p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/"> a 38% discount on this 2024 model, which brings the price down to $499</a>. That’s a straightforward $300 drop, and you don’t need to enter a coupon code or go through complicated checkout processes to secure the deal. The offer applies to all color options, including black, porcelain, and wintergreen. It’s also unlocked, meaning it’s going to work with all major carriers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Simple Design, But Packed With Power</h2>
<p>This slim, sleek phone features curved edges and a glass front and back for that premium look. The 6.3-inch Actua display is bright, pushing crisp, detailed visuals to make the content pop. 120 Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, whether you’re just browsing or trying to play a game.</p>
<p>The phone is packed with Tensor G4, which is Google’s most powerful chip yet. There’s 12 GB RAM for lag-free performance, plus 128 GB storage to house all your essentials. You’ll be able to store tons of media content, all your favorite apps, games, and a lot more, without feeling limited.</p>



<p>You also get a 50MP main camera and a 48MP ultrawide with Macro Focus. Google’s software takes it further with tools like Best Take (to help everyone look their best), Magic Editor (for quick editing), and Add Me (gets the whole group together in one photo). Whether you’re shooting on a bright sunny day or trying to record a scary prank at night, camera quality stays consistent throughout.</p>
<p>Gemini integration makes it even easier to get through your days and boring tasks. You can ask it to summarize content, circle an image or text to search the web, draft replies, etc. And since the Pixel 9 is fully unlocked, you’re free to use it with any major carrier, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Google Fi, and more.</p>
<p>Amazon also offers a trade-in program that could get you up to $650 in savings when you send in your old phone. The value is issued as gift card credit, but note that you might not be able to combine this with the current discount, so double-check the details before checking out.</p>

The open-view design on three sides of the case offers a nice view of the tower's RGB-lit interior.

              <p>Lighting affects your mood, and smart lights make it easy to control both the brightness and color of your space. You can add warmth to your space when you feel like relaxing (also great for the holiday season), or go for a brighter setting for when you need to focus; all remotely.</p>
<p>Those ready to switch up the lighting situation in their home; we come bearing good news. You can now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/">grab the Philips Hue starter kit for just $97 on Amazon, thanks to a 46% discount</a>. That’s a rare drop from its regular $179 price, and you’re getting three A19 smart LED bulbs, a Hue Bridge, and a Hue Smart Button in the box. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. We just recommend acting fast to grab it, because the offer might end soon!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Million Colors, Plus a Wide Temperature Range</h2>
<p>Each bulb is a 75W-equivalent A19 LED. It supports both white and full color ambiance, meaning you can adjust the white temperature or pick from over a million colors to create a vibe that reflects how you’re feeling. Need to focus on a work task? Go for a brighter setting that lets you concentrate. Feel like relaxing after a long day? A nice, warm tone should help you wind down. Hosting a gathering on the weekend? Something playful, fun is going to leave your guests impressed!</p>



<p>You can adjust the lights through the Hue app, the included button, or even just use your voice to let Alexa or Google Assistant take care of it. The app gives you more control, as you can set timers, play around with the color palette, etc. As for the button, you can place it anywhere with the included magnet and use it for quick control. It lets you customize up to 5 scenes, so you can tweak settings without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Hue Bridge, which connects directly to your WiFi router to act as a hub for your system. You can use it to control lights from anywhere, plus unlock advanced features like automations and routines. And since it’s Matter compatible, you can always connect your lights to other smart home devices across platforms.</p>
<p>The setup is simple. All you need to do is install the bulbs, plug in the Philips Hue Bridge, and connect it to the WiFi router, then download the Hue app. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process within a few minutes!</p>

        <p>It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors. Our last official day of operation will be on November 17.</p><p>Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey—pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</p><p>The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision—thank you.</p><p>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying [intellectual property] is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we / NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</p><p>To help support our people as they take their next steps, we’ll also be releasing a sizzle reel from the project publicly, giving everyone the chance to showcase their incredible work and open doors to new opportunities.</p><p>If you’re looking for world-class developers, artists, and storytellers, please reach out—we would be proud to connect you with them.</p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude once again to everyone who supported us along the way. Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.</p><p>Sean Crooks<br>Studio Head</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/netease-games-closes-bad-brain-game-studios]]></content:encoded>

The company adds that it has the discs in hand, but it needs extra time to put together the physical editions.</p><p>"We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays," reads the statement. "We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there.

              <p>We all rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and keeping all of them charged can get challenging. This is especially true for those who are out and about often and can’t afford to sit around waiting for one device to finish charging before plugging in the next. A multi-port, high-output charger can come in handy in these situations, and we just spotted a powerful option going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">100W Baseus USB-C charger block is currently sitting at $29, after a massive 40% drop on its retail price of $49</a>. Both color options (black and white) are discounted. Even better, <strong>you can score a free USB-C cable (valued at $8)</strong> with your purchase. To claim it, click on the <em>“How to claim”</em> link next to the Get 1 free item label on the product page. In the tab that opens, add the charger to your cart, then navigate to the Benefit Item section and add the USB-C cable to your cart as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports to Juice Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>The charger comes with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so you can juice up to three devices at once. Using the single USB-C port gets you up to 100W of power, and when multiple devices are plugged in, Baseus’ BPS 3.0 smart power distribution automatically allocates the required output to each connected device.</p>



<p>Support for all major fast-charging protocols (PD 3.0, QC 3.0, and PPS) translates into efficient charging for a wide range of devices, whether it’s your smartphone, iPad, MacBook, or even Steam Deck. There’s thermal control built in, as well. Baseus Cooling Technology (BCT) monitors temperature consistently in real-time to prevent any overheating problems.</p>
<p>It’s also 43% more compact than most chargers out there, so carrying it around won’t feel heavy. The pins fold down, so you can easily throw the block in your bag or even your pocket and get going. It’s great for remote workers, travelling, plus convenient home use.</p>
<p>It’s now going for just $30, and it also lets you grab a free USB-C cable with your purchase for absolutely nothing. These deals won’t be around for long, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The popular Roblox game Grow a Garden is becoming a film from Story Kitchen. Even more so, the original developers are playing a big part in its production.</p>



<p>As part of the massively popular Roblox game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-square-enix-boss-calls-roblox-grow-a-garden-somewhat-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grow a Garden</a> is an idle multiplayer farming simulator. Players would buy and plant many types of crops and see their garden grow, hence the game. Despite the simple concept, it reached insane player counts in 2025, even beating out Fortnite. There’s clearly demand for more Grow a Garden and, now, it’ll be met on the big screen.</p>



<h2 id="h-story-kitchen-developing-grow-a-garden-film-with-original-developers">Story Kitchen Developing Grow a Garden Film with Original Developers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Roblox</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive article from Deadline</a>, the outlet confirmed that <strong>Roblox’s Grow a Garden is being adapted into a film. </strong>The movie is being produced by Story Kitchen, a well-known name in the adaptation landscape. Furthermore, <strong>the original creators</strong> will join the project to help with its development, acting as producers. A statement from Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg is available on Deadline, saying,</p>



<p>“<strong><em>Grow a Garden</em>&nbsp;is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt</strong>,” said the duo in the statement, “<strong>an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community</strong>.”</p>



<p>Plot details and release information is not available at this time. However, a brief description of the film <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is available on Deadline</a>. The film, currently in early development, will maintain the whimsical spirit of Grow a Garden and focus on nurturing and friendship. Given the simple concept, there’s a lot of room to experiment and craft something. Story Kitchen is producing almost a dozen game adaptations like Shinobi, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-getting-a-movie-in-case-you-missed-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Split Fiction, and Tomb Raider. Hopefully, the fruits of its labor will result in something, well, fruitful.</p>



<p>What do you think of Grow a Garden getting a film adaptation? Did you play the Roblox mode? How do you think the film will do? Let us know in the comments and on the official Insider Gaming Discord!</p>

            <p>
There is perhaps no better setting than some woods or a forest that just sucks ass. Just a confusing, scary, maybe sometimes enchanting mess of nature that is impossible to navigate. Today's latest update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> just so happens to present such a visage, with towering, beautiful trees, and yet again a wonderful sense of scale.
</p>
<p>
This new update is, appropriately, called Roots! I'm sure I don't need to explain to you the meaning there. Aside from the big old trees, there's also new nasties like spiders and giant beetles that will ruin your pilgrimage to the top, and, by the looks of the update's trailer, a fungal zombie infection that takes over your compatriots' bodies. Genuinely conceptually horrifying stuff for a game so cutesy. I like it!
</p>

<p>
The Roots biome comes with 11 new badges to earn too, and some biome-specific items too, like Shroomberries that have random effects, a couple of types of fungi, and some other, secret items. There's also some new items to be found across all biomes, like the rescue claw (does what it says on the tin), the checkpoint flag (does what it says on the tin), and the Book of Bones (does what it says on the tin?).
</p><p>
You'll also find that cooking has been overhauled. According to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/809085268448511599?l=english">Steam post</a> about the update, "a lot more non-food items will now Actually Do Something when cooked," for one. Once cooked poisonous berries will be safe to eat, whereas poisonous mushrooms won't be. And cooked "usable but non-food items such as bandages will no longer grant Extra Stamina."
</p>
<p>
There are a few bug fixes too, and apparently the divorce court has permitted Bing Bong to visit his kids on weekends, which is a strange sentence to have written as a part of my job, but hey ho, I've got bills to pay. The Roots update is available right now, so have at ye.

Other landmarks featured include the Grand Palais with its glass dome, a soaring skyscraper known as Tour Montparnasse, and the Champs-Elysées, which happens to be one of the most famous avenues in the world.</p>



<p>The attention to detail here is impressive, and even the color palette is designed to mimic the real buildings. You’ll also find a booklet inside the box that gives you background information about each of the landmarks.

The LEGO instruction book takes you through each step clearly, so the process won’t feel overwhelming. You can also download the LEGO Builders app for digital, 3D instructions. In the app, you can zoom in on each step, track your progress, save sets, etc.</p>
