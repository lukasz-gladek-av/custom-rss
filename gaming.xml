			<p>Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire promises a lot, giving impressions of an open sky to fly through, putting together a crew, and going on a lot of adventures. Unfortunately, the reality is that Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire wasn’t yet ready to set sail, with issues galore that just compounded until I had to throw in the proverbial towel around what felt like the halfway point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire – Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFHazY90IVQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire follows Glenn Windwalker, the latest in the line of adventurers from the Windwalker family. The story starts with his mum returning from an adventure alone, with Glenn’s father nowhere to be seen. Some time passes, and whatever business Glenn’s parents got involved with catches up with them when their home of Blossom is attacked by the Alliance. Glenn ends up escaping with some of his buddies and vows revenge against the Alliance. It’s all very by the numbers, to be honest. Later on, more factions make themselves known, but by then the problems of Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire and have compounded into a rather boring mess.</p>


<p>For much of the game you will be flying through the skies of Sky Ocean in either a small airjet or a big airship, depending on the environment. The airjets are used to explore the few floating islands and outposts dotted about and used in combat against other airships and flying beasts. The big airship is used to fight the bigger pirate and alliance ships that are all sitting in place across the Sky Ocean.</p>


<p>For what should be an ocean filled with hustle and bustle of other adventurers, traders and more, it feels strange that only your ship is moving through it. It also suffers from lacking draw distances and other issues. This sky ocean has lots of floating lands that appears via pop in or form right in front of you. In the basement region, the island artifacts just did not render properly, constantly appearing and disappearing. One of the areas you’ll find in each region is a hunting zone to gather resources from the flying beasts and they may even have treasure chests, but the random generation is so poor that some treasure chests just won’t open and others just do not exist even if you have flown to the spot that the marker is pointing to.</p>
<p>Combat takes too long and is unrefined. Combat is turn based with parties of up to four facing off against each other. On your turn you can choose to attack, evade, use an item or retreat. There are also Arts, elemental based weapons that can confer status effects on friend and foe alike. There are status effects which come up with the message ‘translation description missing’, so I couldn’t even tell you what some of these do. It isn’t just here that item descriptions are missing, as they are also missing for some items in the shops.</p>

<p>It also just takes too long. If you play battles at normal speed they can take over ten minutes just before of the repeating animations that play out for every attack. Luckily, you can fast forward through these animations to cut down on the time battles take. Early on, battles can be tough, but very quickly they become easy to pass because the enemy patterns hardly change letting you use the same routines to take them out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You would also think in the Sky Oceans there would be quite a lot to do, but there isn’t. In each region, there is at least one outpost that you wander around on foot to get quests, which break down into hunting creatures for meat or taking out pirate airships. When you accept a quest to take out pirate airships, the quest giver says you need to take out five to be successful. In reality, the quest counter requires you take out six to complete the mission. In addition, when fighting in my giant airship, none of my characters ever earned any XP or levelled up, which meant the ship crew remained at level one. Not that it mattered, since the airship is totally overpowered and can take out a pirate ship in a couple of turns.&nbsp;Another issue popped up here, where after finishing battles against pirate airships my airship would inexplicably have drifted off to the edge of the map, smacking up against the air wall that separates regions.</p>

<p>When you are hunting, you will need to gather a certain number of resources, and take them back to the quest giver. First time, complete success. In the second region, I completed the hunt and returned to the town and quest giver, but I could not complete the quest because the game decided I had already completed it despite the quest being open, and the trophy for it never popping.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler is definitely superior to AMD FSR 3.1 but lags behind NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios, according to a very early comparison.</p>
<p>A couple of days back, Digital Foundry shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQKbuUXg9_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face-off video</a> between the three upscalers based on Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart using approximate quality settings, as getting a perfect match proved to not be possible. In addition, the PC version of the game by Insomniac uses a different implementation of Dynamic Resolution Scaling than the console version. Using this approximate recreation of the same visual quality settings, the early comparison highlighted how PSSR is superior to AMD FSR 3.1 in anti-aliasing newly revealed detail and in movement. On the other hand, the upscaler lags behind NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios, as PSSR returns a softer image and DLSS resolves geometry with less aliasing. Still, NVIDIA had over six years to improve its upscaler, while PSSR is just at the beginning, so things will surely improve in the future.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there's an area where the PlayStation 5 PSSR upscaler delivers better results than NVIDIA DLSS, at least in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart. With ray-traced reflections, the Sony upscaler does a better job delivering better image stability, although this could be a result of Insomniac using a custom sampling pattern for PSSR. On lower quality settings, the Sony upscaler merges the checkerboard correctly, delivering a higher resolution output, while checkerboard artifacts are clearly visible with NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>As Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart has a high internal resolution, it is not surprising to see the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler doing a fairly good job even in its first iteration. However, the true test, as Digital Foundry highlighted, will be in games with low internal resolution, such as Alan Wake 2, whose internal res on PlayStation 5 is 864p.</p>
<p><iframe title="Upscaling Face-Off: PS5 Pro PSSR vs PC DLSS/FSR 3.1 in Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQKbuUXg9_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't take longer to know what the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler will be able to do in many other games, as the system launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-details-leak-online.1014927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-online-playtest-leak/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Several users have leaked details on the Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program online.</p>



<p>The leaks <span>started on X (formerly Twitter) with user&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Ethan_ThisGuy/status/1848221882496987233?t=fhm7o87i8WjzEhEMX9QsoQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Ethan_ThisGuy</a>, who shared several images of the playtest’s con</span>tents. Nintendo quickly DMCA’d the content, but mirrors and other users have since uploaded the photos.</p>



<p>The images read, “In this game, the goal is to work with others to fully “develop” a massive, expansive planet by utilising creativity and farmed resources. As you progress across the planet, you’ll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will become essential in your journey.”</p>



<p>It continues, “Throughout your adventure, players will be granted special tools known as Beacons. These Beacons emit a heating light that purifies and developers the land. The higher your Beacon is placed, the wider its Beacon Zone becomes. Within your Beacon Zone, your best work can be done. Players will repeat this process until their current Planetary Block is considered fully developed.” </p>



<p>Images and details from the leaks suggest that the game is going to be a Nintendo MMO, with the visually on-brand in a cartoony fashion. Images of the leaks can be found over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1g8hr2p/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_info_has_already/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program is scheduled to take place between October 24 and November 6.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/british-fallout-like-atomfall-gets-detailed-gameplay-trailer.1014921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/british-fallout-like-atomfall-gets-detailed-gameplay-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Atomfall, the forthcoming British <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>-like game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> studio Rebellion, has received a new trailer detailing more of its setting and gameplay.</p>
<p>Set in 1962, the game takes place in a fictional quarantine zone in the north of England, though is loosely based on the Windscale fire, an accident in a nuclear reactor facility in Cumbria, 1957.</p>
<p>Of course, there's something far more sinister going on here and it's up to players to discover the truth of the accident - as you can see in the trailer below.</p>

<p>For instance, the zone is controlled by a military response team called Protocol but are they really who they seem? Then there's the British Atomic Research Division (B.A.R.D), responsible for experiments in nuclear bunkers. There are other factions too, like the primitive cults that have sprouted in the region along with imposing wicker men.</p>
<p>The trailer provides a clear look at gameplay, which involves plenty of first-person combat, sneaking around military facilities, crafting ammo and tools, and battling giant mechs and glowing zombie-like creatures.</p>
<p>It's clearly inspired by Fallout, but with a welcome British twist. That was certainly my impression of the game when I went hands-on at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, though this trailer provides far more detail beyond me swinging a cricket bat at enemies.</p><p>At the least, I was particularly fond of its various British-isms, from the rolling countryside, to eating cornish pasties, and a character greeting me with a hearty "how do?!". There were plenty of dialogue options too as you uncover the mysteries beneath the hills, though it's unclear for now if RPG-style choices will impact the narrative.</p>
<p>Atomfall will release across current and last-gen consoles - PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S - as well as PC (Steam, Epic, Windows). It's also coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>Will you be giving it a go?</p>
<p>Fallout itself may not be going to the UK anytime soon, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">Fallout: London mod has proven incredibly successful</a> - it's almost at a million downloads.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Elijah Wood is set to star as Dr Jonathan Crane (aka Scarecrow) in Camouflaj's upcoming VR game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>.</p>
<p>Wood, who among many roles is perhaps best known for starring as Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, shared news of his casting with a video message to fans.</p>
<p>"When Camouflaj initially approached me about joining the cast for this, I was super intrigued for a few reasons," Wood said. "I'm a massive Batman fan - the films, games, comics, I collected the toys when I was young - and I was super intrigued at the notion that this next chapter in the Arkham series would be done entirely in VR."</p>

<p>Wood added this was his first experience with motion capture, and the prospect of that "excited" him.</p>
<p>"And then, obviously, playing such an iconic character was a delicious request," Wood closed. I'm very excited to see all of your reactions to this game. I am excited myself to experience it and play it, but until then, remember: Just like fear, the shadow exists within us all."</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whM4tQo02YU">Q&amp;A with the developers</a>, Camouflaj studio head and game director Ryan Payton and director of production at Camouflaj Matt Walker said they had Wood in mind for the role from the very start, with "no backup plan" in place if the actor said no.</p>
<p>
"So, thank God when we prepared all the materials and the whole pitch, he responded very favourably to the offer," the developers shared.</p> <div>

<p>The game is set prior to Arkham Asylum (though after Warner Bros. Montreal's own prequel entry, Batman Arkham Origins). The decision to set the game during this time was a deliberate move by Camouflaj, as it would allow Shadow to feature a younger, less experienced Bat that could be put under pressure without an array of allies.</p><p>For more, our Tom spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-might-be-vr-but-its-the-first-dc-game-since-arkham-knight-im-actually-excited-for">Camouflaj boss Ryan Payton about Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> earlier this year.

            <p>In a climactic scene of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, hero and amateur snowboarder Cloud Strife stands with his fellow adventurers as they are about to face a final, possibly fatal battle. With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.</p>
<p>It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The fan rework of the script is the work of the <a href="https://www.shinraarchaeology.com/retransmod.html">Shinra Archaeology Department</a>, a group of fans who have combed through the original Japanese with the aim of creating a mod that offers "a full retranslation of the game's text that fixes mistakes in the original English translation; improves tonal accuracy using idiomatic language; and conforms to the localization choices of the Compilation and Remake trilogy where applicable." </p>
<p>In other words, they are out to fix that bit where Aerith sees an unwell dude and says: "This guy are sick". (In that case, they've gone with the simple: "The guy in there seems pretty ill.") For the true localisation nerds among you, the modding team have shown all their working. You can see the full script and all its alterations in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gV0egr-cpvBdL0aCX-qke5LhuNfqcB75S_CG7-vG1jM/edit?gid=637880383#gid=637880383">this Google sheets document</a>. </p><p>As for the "let's mosey" line, the solution is counter-intuitive but it checks out. Far from removing that one instance of Cloud's casual call to saunter, this rework actually restores all the <em>other</em> moments when Cloud says it throughout the game, as it appears in the original Japanese. In the English version, it was most often simply translated as "let's go", making our blond buster boy's fascination with moseying a kind of forgotten catchphrase. As a result, when he says it in this climactic moment, it makes no sense. To us English speakers, he's never said it before.</p>
<p>For a fuller understanding of this moment, and why it's jarring, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsiJPoHlPqEEA07AKMQ2Hm2oRLiGkR_uJ">this video series by Tim Rogers</a>, former wordist of Kotaku, who also went through the entirety of Final Fantasy VII, pointing out many of the mistakes made by the original put-upon translator. Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/oOiPU7cmLn0?feature=shared&amp;t=2349">the moment in question</a>, so you don't need to watch all those videos (but you <em>could</em> - they're a lot of fun). </p>
<p>Anyway, if you like the idea of replaying the game with a new localisation effort, you can install the mod using the <a href="https://7thheaven.rocks/">7th Heaven Mod Manager</a>, though you will need <a href="https://github.com/dotaxis/7thDeck">a different mod manager</a> if you want to make it run on Steam Deck, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/final-fantasy-7-retranslation-mod-promises-english-speaking-players-an-experience-as-close-as-possible-to-that-of-japanese-speaking-players/">PC Gamer note</a> in the article that brought it to my attention.

Documentation included a request “that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others.”</p><p>At the time, the internet collectively scoffed at that request. And now, it’s all out in the wild. Today, October 21, ahead of the playtest going live on October 23, some users were able to download the playtest, which weighs in at 2.2GB. Images of this website and its details are now spreading across social media, Discords, and subreddits.</p><p>The leak appears to have been kickstarted by X/Twitter user @Ethan_ThisGuy, who posted images of the playtest website along with the post: “hope Nintendo doesn't kill me for this.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hope nintendo doesn't kill me for this <a href="https://t.co/dgVHQFCaXX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dgVHQFCaXX</a></p>— Ethan :3 (@Ethan_ThisGuy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ethan_ThisGuy/status/1848221882496987233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><em><strong>Spoilers</strong></em><em> for Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test follow:</em></p><p>Those images, which X/Twitter has now pulled offline “in response to a report from the copyright holder” (a clear sign of their legitimacy), reveals a social MMO hybrid experience some are already comparing to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/miiverse">Miiverse</a>, Nintendo’s discontinued social network for 3DS and Wii U.</p><p>The idea, according to leaked images of the Nintendo website, is to work with other players to develop a massive planet via farmed resources and building on your own plot of land. Players use Beacons that emit a healing light that “purifies and develops the land.” The idea is to place multiple Beacons until your planetary block is fully developed.</p><p>The player’s Beacon sounds like a protected space in which only they can move, lift, or edit items. Outside their Beacon is considered a public space anyone can work in.</p><p>There’s a ‘Dev Core’ that acts as a player hub. Here you level up your character, obtain items, and talk to other players. Players earn points for developing the land and socializing with others.</p><p>There’s a definite user-generated content (UGC) aspect to this new game, and you’ll be able to share what you make with others. This is very Nintendo: it says to create UGC players must pass a test in-game to show they understand “the importance of respectful communication.” Only then will players obtain a UGC License and be able to create UGC. There is, as you’d expect, a player report feature, which I imagine will come in handy for tackling all those… certain things players will inevitably build.</p><p>And finally, as Nintendo had signaled, it recommends playing this new game in TV setup with a wired connection, given it’s a server-based experience.</p><p>That’s all we have for now. It’s odd that Nintendo would insist on such secrecy around what sounds like a relatively straightforward Switch online MMO (we still don’t know the name of the thing), but hopefully we’ll know more when it actually goes live later this week and, well, the whole thing inevitably leaks.</p><p>This is a Switch experience for now, but the big question is whether it will also be available on the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today"><u>Switch 2</u></a>, which Nintendo has yet to formally announce.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Information on Nintendo's upcoming Switch Online Playtest Program has leaked online.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo announced it would be hosting a playtest on its console, which related to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service</a>. It noted places would be limited, and only up to 10,000 people would be accepted to participate in the test.</p>
<p>At this time, Nintendo asked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">successful applicants not to disclose details of the test</a>. But, they have, and we now have an idea of what Nintendo is working on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Images from documentation sent to program participants have been shared on social media. They allude to an almost MMO-sounding game, which features blocky Minecraft-like worlds. Players were reportedly told they will need to work together "to fully develop a massive, expansive planet by utilising creativity and farmed resources", with new lands, enemies, and resources appearing while players progress.</p>
<p>Another image described "special tools" called Beacons which would "heal the land". Meanwhile, the playtest will reportedly feature a "social hub" in which players can interact with each other.</p>
<p>The images, seen by Eurogamer earlier this morning, have since been removed from the internet due to a copyright strike by Nintendo.</p> <div>

<p>The playtest is due to officially launch on 24th October, and run for a little under two weeks, until 6th November. It involves a 2.2 GB software download. We will likely hear more on the playtest over the coming weeks, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Nintendo recently released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">motion-sensing alarm clock, Alarmo</a>. The bedside gadget is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">available now in the UK if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber</a>, priced £89.99 on these shores.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The playtest is running from October 23rd, 9PM ET until November 5th, 8PM ET, and is only available to the roughly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266478/nintendo-switch-online-invite-application-beta-playtest">10,000 people who have already registered</a> for the program.&nbsp;</p><p>The test software is now available to download ahead of the start of gameplay, and requires 2.2GB of free space. Participants didn’t sign an NDA, but Nintendo requested in the playtest terms and conditions that users refrain from sharing any details about it — which has gone about as well as can be expected. While Nintendo has <a href="https://x.com/Ethan_ThisGuy/status/1848221882496987233">already started issuing copyright strikes</a> to take leaked media offline, screenshots and information about the playtest are still available across websites <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1848222093864731126">like X</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1g8hzis/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_program_full/">and Reddit</a> at the time of writing.</p><p><strong>Warning: spoilers ahead!</strong></p><p>This appears to be Nintendo’s attempt to develop its first MMO (massively multiplayer online) style game. According to the game description, “the goal is to work with others to fully ‘develop’ a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and framed resources.” Players will encounter “new lands, enemies, and resources” as they progress, and utilize “Beacons” that create zones to develop the environment around where they’re placed. These Beacon zones are personal — players can only “move, lift, or edit items” in zones they have placed, and cannot edit anything within someone else’s Beacon.</p><p>There’s a separate social hub called the “Dev Core” where players can level up, obtain items, and interact with each other. Nintendo also describes “UGC (User-Generated Content) features” for creating and sharing custom content, but players are required to pass an in-game test “to show that you understand the importance of respectful communication” before this capability can be unlocked.</p><p>At a glance, the game shares some similarities with family-friendly MMO’s like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em>. The IP is either entirely new (in that it doesn’t feature any recognizable Nintendo characters) or it’s a placeholder for the game system itself — meaning it could be part of an existing franchise at release. All we know for sure is that previous speculation suggesting the playtest would bring <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/189706-nintendo-switch/80865507">GameCube titles to the Nintendo Switch Online</a> service can probably be put to rest.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve won't be releasing a new Steam Deck console each year because "that's kind of not really fair to your customers".</p>
<p>The handheld PC device will finally be available to purchase in Australia in November. Two of its designers from Valve, Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat, were interviewed by <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">Reviews.org</a> and discussed the trend of yearly hardware refreshes.</p>
<p>"It is important to us, and we've tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence," said Yang. "We're not going to do a bump every year. There's no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that's kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that's only incrementally better.</p>

<p>"So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we're excited about and we're working on."</p>
<p>Valve first released the Steam Deck in North America and Europe in 2022, which was followed by the OLED model in 2023.</p>
<p>While a Steam Deck 2 is in development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-says-technology-doesnt-exist-yet-for-full-steam-deck-20">Valve told Eurogamer last year</a> - ahead of the OLED release - that the technology does not yet exist.</p>
<p>"Obviously we'd love to get even more performance in the same power envelope, but that technology doesn't exist yet," said Aldehayyat. "That's what I think we'd call a Steam Deck 2.0.</p>
<p>"The first Steam Deck was the first moment in time where we felt like there was enough GPU performance in a portable form factor that lets you play all your Steam games. We would love for the trend of perf-per-watt to progress rapidly to do that, but it's not quite there yet."</p>
<p>It's certainly an interesting take from the company, considering Sony's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro</a>. It costs £700 and includes an upgraded GPU among other features, though the improvements are incremental.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the PS5 Pro in action, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-foundry-posts-more-the-last-of-us-part-2-ps4-pro-capture">Digital Foundry has clips</a> of The Last of Us Part 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-got-a-sony-offer-for-a-timed-exclusive-but-pearl-abyss-refused/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimson-desert-got-a-sony-offer-for-a-timed-exclusive-but-pearl-abyss-refused.1014858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-got-a-sony-offer-for-a-timed-exclusive-but-pearl-abyss-refused/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In July 2023, Korean publications <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Sony was attempting to secure some sort of exclusivity for Crimson Desert, the upcoming action/adventure game in development at Pearl Abyss.</p>
<p>Now, the Korean developer and publisher primarily known for Black Desert has confirmed that was indeed the case. More specifically, they revealed to have received an offer from Sony for a timed exclusivity that would ban the Xbox version for a period of time. However, they decided to go with the self-publishing route after judging it would result in higher profits.</p>
<p>The news came from the recent Kiwoom Securities Corporate Day, where Pearl Abyss executives talked about Crimson Desert in great detail, as <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/vlvk1703/223609533714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by financial blogger HPNS. The game notoriously received many delays (it was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to launch in Winter 2021</a>); according to Pearl Abyss, this is because the developers added many gameplay features to the open world design, mainly to improve interactions with the environment and NPCs. Games like Assassin's Creed and The Legend of Zelda were referenced for the player's freedom, and Red Dead Redemption and The Witcher 3 were also huge inspirations.</p>
<p>When it comes to AI, Pearl Abyss says the NPCs have a behavior system that lets them judge the best course of action depending on the situation. For example, if they see that too many of their allies have already been slaughtered by the player, they may attempt to flee for their life. There's also a reputation system, and players can allegedly behave like a hero or a villain depending on their actions. The behaviors also change based on the day/night cycle or dynamic weather, with NPCs getting slower at night or when the temperature is freezing. Pearl Abyss also claimed having their own engine makes these features easier to implement than they would be with Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>A final interesting tidbit is that Sony reportedly gave a highly positive evaluation of Crimson Desert, which likely explains their offer. They compared it to Ghost of Tsushima for the story's quality and atmosphere, which says a lot, given that Sucker Punch's title was the most successful new IP released by Sony's PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>For more on Crimson Desert, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shown-off-in-50-minute-gameplay-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 report</a>. In theory, the game is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, although we wouldn't be too surprised if that changed again.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> studio Cloud Imperium Games were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloud-imperium-quietly-steal-star-citizen-developers-weekends-from-under-them-with-mandated-overtime-in-the-lead-up-to-citizencon">mandating overtime for employees</a> in the lead-up to their fan convention, Citizencon, which was held this past weekend. Additionally, this TOIL (time off in lieu) wouldn’t be made available until the release of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc"> space game</a> Star Citizen’s accompanying single player campaign, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squadron-42">Squadron 42</a>.</p>
<p>At CitizenCon over the weekend, CIG head promiser Chris Roberts said that he’s “confident” that Sqorty-two will release next year, 2026, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-confident-of-releasing-standalone-single-player-story-game-squadron-42-in-2026">Ian Games</a>. CIG also released a video of the entire first hour and fifteen of the game, which you can watch below.</p>

<p>As of this May, Star Citizen had raised over $700 million in crowd-funding. I imagine a fair old chunk of that went towards rounding up at least one and half Kojima’s worth of Gr8 M8s, including Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Mark Strong, Sophie Wu, and Henry Cavill.</p><p>I haven’t watched the whole video yet, but it’s got some fun aliens in it. They’ve got teeth like the Goombas from the (good) Super Mario Movie. Has that film has a proper critical re-evaluation yet? Like, I feel that bad but interesting is better than just, palatable. I’m trying to fill space here because I don’t want to start watching the video and saying things about it. It’s very impressive but it’s still vaporware until I can physically shoot some aliens and make dialogue choices that annoy Gillian Anderson. I don't want to believe it's real just yet because, context aside, it does look very good.</p>
<p>Sqorty-two was first announced in 2012, so this clip marks a decade and change since. The game was announced as “feature complete” at Citizencon last year. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wing-commander-3-heart-tiger">Wing Commander 3: Heart Of The Tiger</a> is currently on sale! at <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">GOG for £2.39</a>, and you get to make Mark Hamill say dumb shit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When the Nintendo Switch Online playtest was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-open-playtest-for-undisclosed-switch-online-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on October 10, fans were extremely curious of what it could be all about. Today, the playtest became available for download to the users who had been selected ahead of the test actually going live on October 23. Alongside the download, users were also provided with plenty of information on the mysterious Nintendo Switch Online playtest, and those details have just <a href="https://streamable.com/j23wki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is a community game about connections with which Nintendo seeks to 'test the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay' on its servers. Here's the Nintendo Switch Online playtest overview:</p>
<p><em>In this game, the goal is to work with others to fully "develop" a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and farmed resources. As you progress across the planet, you'll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will become essential to your journey.</em></p>
<p><em>Throughout your adventure, players will be granted special tools known as Beacons. These Beacons emit a healing light that purifies and develops the land. The higher your Beacon is placed, the wider its Beacon Zone becomes. Within your Beacon Zone, your best work can be done. Players will repeat the process until their current Planetary Block is considered fully developed.</em></p>
<p><em>The Beacons players receive will be their most valuable tool. You are the master of your Beacon Zone. Only you can move, lift, or edit items within your Beacon's light. Just as others cannot edit things within your Beacon Zone, you cannot edit things in someone else's Beacon Zone. Places outside of Beacon Zones are public areas that anyone can work in. In public areas, anyone can pick up things, place them, and edit them. To protect your builds and precious items, you'll want to store them inside your Beacon Zone for safekeeping.</em></p>
<p><em>The Dev Core is a separate space from the planet you'll be developing. Think of it as a social hub to gather with other players. At the Dev Core, you can level up your character, get items you will need for your journey, commune with others, and more. Players earn Connex Points by interacting with other players in a variety of ways. Players can use Connex Points in the Dev Core to raise their Connection Level. By increasing your Connection Level, players will have access to fun community-related items.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Every player is equipped with a special skill known as the Development Positioning System, or DPS. This allows players to see a wide array of details, including the development status of the planet and the positions of other players. With the DPS's spectate feature, players can see Beacons and other players from great distances.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest is certainly not what we thought it would be. All the same, it's an interesting endeavor for Nintendo, and if it really helps them push the server boundaries for multiplayer, all the better. Stay tuned for any more leaks and info on it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-gets-physical-disc-release-on-october-21-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1014819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-physical-disc-release-on-october-21-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Not even 24 hours since Game Science teased its release, the launch date for the physical disc version of Black Myth: Wukong on PlayStation 5 (PS5) has been leaked online.</p>



<p>According to known data miner <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1848035754372677750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, physical edition of Black Myth: Wukong will launch on Monday, October 21 in the United States. The game will be available for $64.99.</p>







<p>For those in Europe, he said that it will launch “very soon” for €69.99. He didn’t have a specific date, however, at the time of writing. Nor  did he have information on other possible region launches.</p>



<p>“Destined Ones, thank you for your patience!” the studio said on Sunday about the pending release. “With the master disc for Black Myth: Wukong ready, the PS5 physical edition will be available to you very soon.”</p>



<p>If billbil-kun’s claim is accurate, an announcement should be coming within the next handful of hours after publishing. Also, for those wondering, it will be available from multiple retailers, and be an actual disc that comes with the copy of Black Myth: Wukong. It won’t just be a code in a box.</p>



<p>When it launched in August, Black Myth: Wukong became one of the most-played games in Steam history thanks to strong launch sales in China. In just its first month alone, the game sold over 20 million copies and had earned over $1 billion in gross revenue on Steam alone. </p>



<p>Just recently, it was discovered that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-esrb-xbox/">had been rated by the ESRB</a> for a release on Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up the physical disc for Black Myth: Wukong on PS5? Let us know in the comments, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations launches on October 25, but gameplay from the game has leaked online ahead of its official release. </p>



<p>A YouTuber by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@swr.nezumi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vexi</a> managed to get a rom of the game early, and played it on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch emulator Yuzu</a>. They then uploaded two separate six-minute videos of raw gameplay. They made sure, however, to not include any story spoilers for players.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-it-s-claimed">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/">Insomniac “Gearing Up” To Show More From Wolverine, It’s Claimed</a></h6>



<p>Also, they made it clear in the video description for one that they pre-ordered the game in order to support the developers.</p>



<p>“[I] don’t usually upload stuff like this, but figured people might want to see it since the rom is out there now,” the description reads. “Don’t worry, I already pre-ordered the game on Steam, but I’ve been so excited to play it I wanted to check it out as soon as I could.”</p>



<p>You can check out both gameplay videos for Sonic X Shadow Generations below. It should go without saying, however, that there’s a good chance they get taken down by Nintendo in short order. And let us know what you think of the gameplay in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Rebellion has published a five-minute deep dive into Atomfall online, giving players an in-depth look at the world that they’ll be exploring in this remarkable and unique game. I played Atomfall at Gamescom and can safely say it’s one of my most highly anticipated games – and that’s not just because I’m a huge Fallout fan.</p>



<p>Check out the latest Atomfall trailer below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-atomfall">Prepare for Atomfall</h2>



<p>Atomfall <strong>feels like </strong>Fallout set in the United Kingdom, but it’s so much more than that. It’s unique enough to stand apart from Bethesda Game Studios’ post-apocalyptic series, and it all begins with Atomfall being inspired by <strong>real-world events</strong> that occurred in the 1950s.</p>



<p>It’s also not exactly a post-apocalyptic game, which you’ll come to learn a bit better when you check out the video below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Atomfall | Gameplay &amp; World First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mDNzwnwk4pQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In Atomfall, you’re left up to your own devices to explore and survive in a ‘quarantine zone’, but everything is not what it seems. From what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/">I experienced at Gamescom</a>, Atomfall is a game that encourages freedom and a multi-faceted approach, allowing users to use their wits and the game’s fundamental mechanics to overcome objectives however they see fit.</p>



<p>It’s also possible to kill absolutely everyone if you so desire, so that’s great.</p>



<p>Atomfall is set to be released in March 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series XS. It’s also coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, which is a <strong>huge </strong>win for subscribers.</p>

<p>FlyQuest is the latest team to be eliminated from the League of Legends World Championship, falling just short against Gen.G in the quarterfinals in Paris. What started as a balanced fixture turned into a dominating finish for Gen.G, who will now move into the semifinals with the hope of taking down T1 – and Faker.</p>



<p>In an emotional post-match interview, FlyQuest’s Bwipo was seen shedding tears. This is the furthest the organisation has got at the League of Legends World Championship <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one-gone">Another One Gone</h2>



<p>Only four teams now remain in the most prestigious tournament in esports. It has been a stellar year for League of Legends, and this tournament has been no different. We’ve seen record-breaking viewership throughout the competition thus far, and the crowning jewel of the event – the grand final – is yet to be played.</p>



<p>FlyQuest had a solid run at Worlds 2024 that led to a fifth-place finish. Historically, the organisation has made it to Worlds <strong>once</strong>, and even then, the team finished in twelfth place.</p>



<p>This year has been a remarkable one for the team, and there were straight expectations that the squad would get at least this far. It was just weeks ago that the team clutched the top spot at LCS Summer 2024, netting a $100,000 prize – the same amount that they’ve walked away from Worlds with.</p>



<p>In an emotional post-game interview, FlyQuest’s Bwipo said:</p>

<p>It’s tough to stay positive but we made you guys believe. That was the goal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will now be a hiatus lasting a few days before the two semifinal fixtures take place in Paris, France:</p>



<ul>
<li>Weibo Gaming vs. Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>T1 vs. Gen.G Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>T1 is still the favourite to win, but Gen.G has had a phenomenal tournament thus far and hasn’t dropped a series. </p>



<p>Do you think T1 can pull off the win yet again? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> enjoys almost universal acclaim from <a href="http://v/">critics</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-2/">fans</a> alike, Bloober capitalised on the fervor by announcing an original sci-fi survival horror called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-developer-bloober-reveals-next-game-original-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, insisting it has "evolved" and learned from prior missteps.</p>

<p>"It was tough for those couple of years before [Silent Hill 2's] release," director/producer Jacek Zieba told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloober-team-says-its-done-with-shitty-games-and-silent-hill-2-remake-wasnt-a-fluke/1100-6527269/">Gamespot</a>. "Now it's very good spirits inside [the studio]. We want to show what we can do on our own, how we can evolve our ideas."</p><p>"They recreated a legendary game," director/designer Wojciech Piejko said of the different internal Bloober team that worked on the remake. "They made the impossible possible, and it was a bumpy road because of all the hate on the internet. The pressure was big on them, and they delivered, and for the company, it's an amazing moment."</p>
<p>"We want to be a horror company," Zieba added. "We want to find our niche, and we think we found our niche, so now we just… let's evolve with it. And how that happens is more complex, but it also happens organically in a way, like with [2016's] <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, people in the studio were like, 'Okay, we made some shitty games before, but we [can] evolve'."</p>
<p>"We gathered a team that loves horror," Piejko added. "So I think, for us, it would not be easy to switch [to other genres], and we don't want to."</p>
<p>"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer's Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>, awarding the game an impressive five out of five stars in the process.</p><p>Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 remake has already sold a total of 1m copies</a> across both physical and digital media since its global launch on 8th October. That likely makes Silent Hill 2 Remake the best-selling Silent Hill game ever.</p>
<p>It's been almost two weeks since fans were welcomed back to Silent Hill again, but as yet, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-silent-hill-2-remake-fans-warn-of-brookhaven-hospital-progress-glitch">still no remedy for a glitch that's soft-locking some players' progress towards the end of the Brookhaven Hospital level in Silent Hill 2 Remake. Here's everything you need to know about the glitch... and how best to avoid it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-londons-patch-1-02-is-out-now-with-hundreds-of-fixes-and-a-specific-focus-on-graphical-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout: London has received a massive patch from Team FOLON, which includes hundreds of changes/fixes to enhance the overall game experience.</p>
<p>With an overwhelmingly positive community response seen by Team FOLON following the release of Fallout: London (which has been redeemed almost a million times), the developers are now saying that the newest Patch, 1.02, has significantly improved the mod. Interestingly, Team FOLON did tease about how they are working on a massive patch and were said to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-londons-next-patch-said-to-bring-huge-improvements-team-folon-drafted-extra-help-for-mod/">bring in "extra workforce"</a> to ensure that the execution is optimal this time.</p>
<p>While the patch covers several areas of problems, the primary focus was to improve the visual experience. Hence, more significant changes were performance optimization, mesh fixes, and even the implementation of collision measures to avoid inconsistent game crashes during specific scenarios. It surely is a huge update; hence, here is the changelog below, mentioning all the major improvements made by Team FOLON:</p>
<p><em><strong>Major Fixes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unexpected broken LOD clip volumes have now been identified and removed across the board:</em><br>
<em>This should fix save corruption/save file issues in Islington world, Dump world, IWM World and St pauls world. </em><em>This requires a rework of the LOD in these worldspace. (Check 3D Section for more information)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Previsbine (PRP) regeneration:</em><br>
<em>Previs and Precombines have been regenerated for the project. Requires further testing on completion. </em><em>This should fix various random/repeatable crashes and previsibility issues (Culling issues, Check 3D Section for more information)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There were also many other fixes for 3D art and animation in Fallout: London, such as:</p>
<p><strong><em>Over one hundred mesh fixes:</em></strong><br>
<em>Various improvements to meshes to increase performance and fix precombine crashes</em><br>
<em>Various collision meshes fixed both to improve gameplay and fix potential crashes</em><br>
<em>LOD Updates:</em><br>
<em>Identified and fixed all missing LOD materials for material swaps across all worldspaces - (Implementation still happening)</em><br>
<em>New/Missing LOD textures and materials generated</em><br>
<em>Mushroom meshes optimized for LOD</em><br>
<em>Weeping willow trees improved</em><br>
<em>Regeneration of LOD with much higher detail texture atlas (This will increase the size of the LOD files but improve visual quality and performance)</em><br>
<em>A massive rework of the "Mega meshes" is happening (These are the large meshes used to display a separate worldspaces LOD, which may be causing dump load crashes)</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout: London - Official Patch 1.02 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANhbGzvUVnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Several other quest-related changes were made, including "tiny" fixes that aren't worth mentioning here, but it is safe to say that Patch 1.02 marks a significant milestone for Fallout: London.</p>

            <p>The team behind "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> meets Skyrim" viral hit Hawthorn are "developing this game from [their] personal pockets".</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-rpg-hawthorn-looks-like-stardew-valley-and-skyrim-had-an-adorable-baby-together">we reported</a> that several former developers from studios such as Bethesda, BioWare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> had banded together to develop the delightful-looking Hawthorn, which you can check out below:</p>

<p>Despite popping up on <em>thousands</em> of wishlists, however, Near Studios co-founder and CEO, Heather Cerlan, has revealed that despite the fervent interest its game has sparked, the dozen or so developers responsible for bringing Hawthorn to life are still not getting paid as the studio has no funding.</p>
<p>"The fact that we are developing this game from our personal pockets was completely lost," Cerlan told to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-18/viral-new-indie-video-game-hawthorn-has-a-tragic-backstory?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a>. "We have the ambitions and the visions; we don’t however have the funding yet."</p>
<p>Near Studios was founded in 2022 but following a desperate family tragedy, Cerlan's plans were derailed and the team lost two of its original co-founders - one "because of a disagreement in direction; the other because he couldn’t get out of a previous contract". She then got in touch with former Bethesda coworker Jason Richardson, who "had been envisaging Hawthorn for many years".</p><p>This delay, however, meant the team was looking for financial backing when independent games funding had all but dried up. But although Cerlan said she tried - and failed - to secure funding for the project throughout most of 2024, the team remains "pretty determined to get this to market one way or another". If funding cannot be found, Cerlan said the studio is considering a KickStarter campaign.</p>
<p>"I had a general idea for a game, but it was never about the game," Cerlan said. "It was about building a culture, building a team I was excited about essentially retiring at.</p>
<p>"Now we're focusing on the game and the community. Our hope is everything else will come."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
