			<p><strong>Riot</strong> has announced that the <strong>2XKO </strong>team, which just celebrated launching the new <strong>League of Legends-</strong>based 2v2 tag fighter out of early access less than a month ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">January 20</a>,</strong> will lose <strong>80 members of its development team</strong> in a round of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoffs</a></strong>. The news was confirmed in a blog post from the game's executive producer, <strong><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">Tom Cannon</a></strong>, who cited that despite the game doing well with its "<em>core audience</em>," the "<em>overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>While the statement itself doesn't cite the exact number of developers who were laid off, a report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> adds that a Riot spokesperson confirmed that approximately 80, which rounds out to approximately half of the game's initial development team, are losing their jobs.</p>



<p>"<em>As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO</em>," Cannon explained. "<em>The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</em>"</p>



<p>Cannon added that the plans for the upcoming 2026 Competitive Series remain "<em>unchanged</em>," and that this decision is a "<em>reshaping</em>" of the team, "<em>to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward</em>." Cannon also noted that the decision is not a reflection on any individual member of the development team, and that Riot is doing what it can to help the impacted developers.</p>



<p>Cannon concluded, "<em>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</em> <em>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the 2XKO community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you for playing 2XKO, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community</em>."</p>



<p>At the top of the year, 2XKO was one of Wccftech's<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2026-tag-fighters-dominance/"> Most Anticipated Fighting Games of 2026</a>. Before that, even in its early access state, it made our list for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Best Fighting Games of 2025</a>. It's a bold fighting game with a strong aesthetic that gives players a fresh introduction to the League of Legends franchise and its characters that have lasted for so long.</p>



<p>This is the latest layoff in the video game industry, after January was already riddled with layoffs from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon</a></strong>.</p>

The game, set in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe, launched in early access on PC <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-early-access-starts-october-7/">in October</a> and hit consoles <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-is-coming-to-console-january-20/">just a few weeks ago</a>.</p><p><em>2XKO</em> has been in development for years, with Riot first announcing the project under the codename <em>Project L</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915506/riot-games-league-of-legends-10th-anniversary-marc-merrill-interview">in 2019</a> as part of broader plans to expand the company’s lineup beyond <em>League of Legends</em>. While some of Riot’s expansion ideas have worked out, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">Netflix’s animated series <em>Arcane</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915322/riot-project-a-tactical-shooter-league-of-legends">tactical shooter</a> that would eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265402/valorant-riot-shooter-launch-date">become <em>Valorant</em></a>, the company also shut down its indie publishing label in 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">as part of layoffs</a> affecting around 11 percent of its staff to focus more on its “core live games.” The changes for <em>2XKO</em> also reflect an increasingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">competitive market</a> for live service games that has even proved difficult <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">for Sony to overcome</a>.</p><p>“As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” Cannon says in the post. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.” The smaller team will “dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for.”</p><p>Cannon didn’t specify how many jobs are being impacted by the changes. A Riot spokesperson <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/riot-lays-off-2xko-developers-less-than-three-weeks-after-release-overall-momentum-hasnt-reached-the-level-needed-to-support-a-team-of-this-size/">tells <em>PC Gamer</em></a> that about 80 staffers, making up less than half of <em>2XKO’s</em> development team, will be laid off of the team. Riot didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>. Affected staffers will be given assistance finding new jobs internally at Riot and, where that’s not possible, 6 months of notice pay and severance, Cannon says.</p><p>“Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” according to Cannon. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/876038/riot-games-2xko-layoffs-job-cuts-league-of-legends]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s New Fighting Game Is Already Imploding As It Lays Off 80 Developers Less Than a Month After Coming To Console]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/2xko-layoffs-league-legends-riot-update-2000666998</link>
            <guid>1430521</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>2XKO</em> hasn’t even finished its <a href="https://kotaku.com/2xko-ps5-league-legends-fighting-game-issues-2000661845">first month out on PlayStation 5</a> and Xbox Series X/S and Riot Games is already cutting its losses. The<em> League of Legends</em> maker announced that it would be laying off 80 employees as the tag-teaming fight game fails to gain momentum.</p> <p>“I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” executive producer Tom Cannon <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">wrote in a new blog post on February 9</a>. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.”</p>

 <p>Featuring fighters from <em>League of Legends</em>‘ Runeterra universe, <em>2XKO</em> employs beautiful cel-shaded animations and tons of flashy combos. But it seems none of that was enough to help it make a huge splash in the fighting game community when it came to PC in Early Access last October. The game hit its 1.0 launch and arrived on consoles last month, where it became the third most-downloaded free-to-play game across PS4 and PS5, putting it ahead of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>That sounds…not bad considering the game’s existing trajectory, but apparently Riot was expecting something much bigger. Or maybe it was always the plan to cut the development team in half after release as the<em> League of Legends</em> company struggles to find success outside of its hit MOBA.</p>

 <p>Cannon said that there are no plans to pull the plug on 2XKO,and its remaining team will continue updating the game and carrying through with its year-one competitive plans. “Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” he wrote. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.”</p>

 <p>Cannon acknowledged how bad the layoffs and the timing sounded. “I know this update will raise questions and concerns,” he wrote. “That’s understandable.” But he didn’t have anything more concrete to share to reassure fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“They Don’t Know How to Run a Game Studio”: Former BaRB Staff Call Out MindsEye Leadership as Leslie Benzies Takes Temp. Leave]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-dont-know-how-to-run-a-game-studio/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>MindsEye</strong>, from UK developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy (BaRB)</strong>, was arguably the worst game to come out in 2025. It was the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst game of last year by Metacritic's standards, </a>reaching only a <strong>37</strong>, and was called out ruthlessly for the broken state it arrived in on launch. While the studio has made <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mindseye-update-is-a-big-step-forward-for-both-build-a-rocket-boy-and-mindseye-new-content-is-in-development/">several strides to update and fix the game </a>and save the studio, a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-build-a-rocket-boy-save-itself">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> digs into whether that's even possible. According to some former members of BaRB staff, the answer is a resounding no.</p>



<p>To say MindsEye and Build a Rocket Boy have had a difficult time in the last year would be an understatement. Before the game even came out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">negative previews</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">sudden departure of two high-level executives</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies leaking into the wild early</a> spelled a disastrous launch for MindsEye. </p>



<p>BaRB did its best to quell concerns at the time, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/"> while it was "<em>heartbroken</em>,"</a> it promised to update and fix the game, but the damage was done. Players <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">were getting refunds</a>, and the Reddit page was littered with screencaps and videos of the game's worst bugs. Less than a month after its release, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">confirmed it would be <strong>suffering mass layoffs</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As BaRB warned players it would release updates <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">"<em>less frequently</em>"</a> to try and pack in as much as it can per update, in the months following its launch, an open letter from <strong>93 BaRB developers called out the </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/"><strong>studio's leaders, Leslie Benzies and Mark Gerhard</strong></a><strong>,</strong> as the root of the studio's problems. A little more than a week after that open letter, a report from the BBC included more statements from BaRB employees and revealed new examples pointing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">Gerhard and Benzies as the root of the studio's problems</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Benzies and Gerhard blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/"> internal and external "<em><strong>saboteurs</strong></em>"</a> for the company's issues. A story that Gerhard recently doubled down on, as the studio claimed to have acquired evidence of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-claims-it-has-evidence-of-a-1-1m-coordinated-campaign-to-sabotage-its-reputation/"><strong>"<em>coordinated campaign</em>"</strong> </a>to smear the reputation of BaRB and MindsEye.</p>



<p>Now, GI.Biz's new report is the latest example that shows, once again, the simplest answer is probably the truth. Instead of an alleged smear campaign that cost an unnamed American company upwards of <strong>$1.1 million</strong> to carry out, MindsEye and BaRB's troubles more likely stem from poor leadership that was seemingly unwilling to listen to the hundreds of talented developers they hired to make this game.</p>



<p>"<em>I'd hoped for more of an explanation about the layoffs and our company situation</em>," said one former BaRB staff member when recalling the events of what happened within BaRB shortly after MindsEye launched. "<em>But instead, <strong>we'd been told there were saboteurs inside and outside the company</strong> trying to take us down. <strong>Leslie didn't seem to take any blame for the game's launch</strong>. It was genuinely <strong>offensive</strong> that he didn't trust his own employees. The idea that we'd sabotage a game we'd spent countless hours working on was just rude to me.</em>"</p>



<p>One thing mentioned in the report is the idea that co-founder and co-chief executive officer Leslie Benzies would fixate on a certain feature or new idea that he demanded be given priority over everything else developers were doing. The staffers who spoke to the BBC for their report in October 2025 dubbed them "<em>Leslies</em>," though that specific shorthand is not mentioned here.</p>



<p>"<em>If management had concentrated on tightening everything up at that point, <strong>then it could have worked</strong></em>," added <strong>Ben Newbon</strong>, former lead data analyst for BaRB. "<em>But instead, they kept on trying to throw extra stuff on it</em>. <em>Leslie's eye would be caught by something in particular and then insist this extra feature be added in, even like a month before launch. There wasn't enough time to test those things and to get all the pieces in place to actually <strong>make it work without it breaking</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Another staff member added, referring to Benzies, "<em>They crushed their own talent under the yoke of appeasing a single person at the very top</em>." One former member even believed the game could have been a hit, if not for management. "<em>He [Benzies] may have had a winning formula if he'd have listened to the advice from the literal hundreds of fantastic, insanely talented, and hard-working industry professionals they spent so much time and money hiring</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We had so many fundamental changes to the game that it <strong>would've been impossible to make a good game in the time we had</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Speaking of Benzies, the report also adds that he has taken a <strong>temporary leave</strong> from the studio, with a statement from Gerhard saying he is on "<em>a well-earned temporary leave to recharge after more than a year of working around the clock</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>He has our deepest gratitude, and with the leadership team and your support, I will guide us forward</em>," Gerhard continued. It's unclear if this leave will become permanent at this stage, though if some of the staff who spoke to GI.Biz for this report are correct, there won't be a BaRB to come back to.</p>



<p>"<em>Even if they had the best leadership in the world, there's no way to bring this back</em>," said Newbon. "<em>Even if they fix all of the bugs and technical issues, <strong>it's still an extremely boring game</strong>. Leadership do not listen. Plus, they've culled over half the studio. They don't know how to run a business. </em><strong><em>They don't know how to run a game studio</em>.</strong>"</p>



<p>Another former staff member added, "<em>I don't think BaRB survives this crisis. I believe the end is coming for BaRB, and it's not heralded by saboteurs, </em><strong><em>but by Mark and Leslie themselves</em>.</strong>"</p>

		<p>Goodbye, football! You were wonderful to me this year. I'd also like to congratulate my nine-year-old for once again calling the coin flip in the Super Bowl again—she's on a three-year streak at the moment. We put $50 on the coin flip every year, with me joking about how it'll pay for her college. The funny part is a week ago, we set her up with a debit card, after a trip to the mall resulted in two stores that would not let her pay with cash. The app lets us reward her with money for doing chores—and we no longer have to stress about where she put her wallet. Anyway, when she won the coin toss, she turned to me and said: "hey, how much of that do <em>I </em>get?" </p><p>I promptly opened my phone and sent her $25.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is Team Ninja’s new open-world-ish Soulslike. All things considered, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-the-kotaku-review-2000665666">it’s pretty great</a>. The action is top-notch. You can play a sizable chunk of the start of the game for free via the demo, which includes a prologue boss fight against Yamagata Masakage. He might kill you a bunch. You might end up thinking <em>Nioh 3</em> isn’t for you. But that would be a dumb reason to lose out on experiencing a very good video game.</p> <p>Plenty of players will have no trouble with this prologue fight whatsoever, but I’ve already come across plenty of recent<em> Nioh</em> inductees who have struggled. Here are some tips for skating past Yamagata Masakage.</p> <h2>Grind some levels</h2> <p>If you’re getting your ass kicked, go fight a bunch of guys until you have enough Amrita to get to level six or seven. Put points into stats like Constitution and Strength. You’ll also get better armor drops this way. There’s a Yokai right behind you at the last shrine before the Yamagata Masakage fight. Kill that thing a bunch to get some better gear.</p>

 <h2>Summon an ally</h2> <p>This is also where the game teaches you how to summon NPC allies at the little blue pools of light. You spend Ochoko cups to “call” AI-controlled Acolytes to help you. Doing so goes a long way toward making the Yamagata Masakage fight a walk in the park.</p> <h2>Memorize the attack pattern and stay out of harm’s way</h2> <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is a Soulslike which means you need to know when to watch, when to wait, and when to be aggressive. Yamagata Masakage only has a handful of different attack patterns and animations and you should be able to block them all without getting stunned and still have time to create space and recover your stamina before the next barrage. In Ninja stance, it’s extra easy to play keep away.</p>

 <h2>Master the Burst Counter</h2> <p>If you’re having trouble with this fight, the best thing to do is not to worry about chipping away at Yamagata Masakage’s health throughout the entire fight. Instead, keep blocking and maintaining distance until he uses his special attack that flashes a red glowing aura around him right before it lands. Hit the right trigger to stance-shift right at that moment to parry it. That’s called a Burst Counter.</p>

 <p>When successful, you can transition into attacking to quickly stun him. Get a three-hit combo in and then back off until the next time he glows red before his attack. You can basically block and Burst Counter the entire fight as long as you manage your stamina meter carefully.</p> <h2>Let your Acolyte do all the work</h2> <p>While Yamagata Masakage is focused on attack you and you’re soaking up all his attacks by blocking, your AI-controlled Acolyte should be tearing into him from behind. Easy mode! Just keep aggro-ing him while your friend does all of the work.</p>

 <h2>Save your Living Artifact to finish the fight</h2> <p>Filling up your Amrita Gauge throughout the fight will let you press Y + B/triangle + circle to initiate a powerful transformation in which you summon your equipped Guardian Spirit and can unload on the enemy until the short cooldown expires. You only have to get Yamagata Masakage down to less than a third of his life before the battle ends and he’ll flee. Just watch out for his attack change-up in the second half of the battle, where his red glow animation adds some extra delays before it hits.</p> <p>With these strats, hopefully you’ll be able to make short work of Yamagata Masakage and experience the first part of <em>Nioh 3 </em>which begins to open up exploration. From there you can do lots of stuff before taking on the game’s first real&nbsp;major boss: Jakotsu-baba. That fight is the game’s first real skill check, but you’ll have more tools in your arsenal by the time you get to it.</p>

The company announced this in a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">blog post</a>, and though it doesn't share how many employees are being laid off, a Riot spokesperson told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"><em>Game Developer</em></a><em> </em>that approximately 80 employees were let go, which is around half of the game's development team.&nbsp;</p><p>As for why, Riot says that while 2XKO has resonated with a passionate core audience, "overall momentum hasn't reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term." Despite the layoffs, Riot says it's committed to making key improvements to the game and supporting its community through tournament organizers and local fighting game communities.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrUde1RDyM4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrUde1RDyM4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>&nbsp;"After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the 2XKO team," 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon writes in the blog post. "I want you to know that decision wasn't made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO. The game hasn't resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn't reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term. With a smaller, focused team, we're going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we've already heard you asking for. We'll share some of our plans soon."&nbsp;</p><p>Riot's plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged, Cannon writes in the blog post, adding this decision reflects a shift in how the team operates and isn't a "judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We're reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward."&nbsp;</p><p>Cannon writes that Riot is committed to helping the affected employees through this transition, "including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance where it's not."&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>The hearts of Game Informer staff are with everyone affected by these layoffs.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/09/riot-games-is-laying-off-around-80-2xko-employees-three-weeks-after-the-games-launch]]></content:encoded>

      <p>Discord announced earlier today that, beginning in March, all users across the <em>planet </em>will eventually need to be age-verified in order to access every feature and channel available on the platform.</p><p>Beginning in early March, and rolling out globally, every Discord account is going to be marked as "teen-appropriate" by default. Users who are older than that will need to upload either a face scan or some ID (via a third-party vendor) to have their full access restored.</p><p>Here's the important part of<a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Discord's press release</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Discord is announcing enhanced teen safety features rolling out globally that reinforce its long-standing commitment to creating a safer and more inclusive experience for users over the age of 13.

			<p>A couple of months ago, independent developer <strong>Chaos Manufacturing</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/sol-shogunate-samurai-space-opera-action-rpg-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its debut game</a>, a sci-fi action roleplaying game titled <strong>SOL Shogunate</strong>. The game is quite different from your average science fiction setting: the developers describe it as a "<strong>samurai space opera</strong>". Essentially, the developers have imagined an alternate future in which humanity has colonized the Solar System, but <strong>society has somehow retained feudal Japanese culture</strong>. The game takes place primarily on the Moon, where the way of the sword is law under the rule of a powerful Shogunate.</p>



<p>The Moon features artificial gravity-creating cities, <strong>each designed as an homage to a revered era of Japanese history</strong>. These gleaming metropolises showcase towering space elevators, bullet trains, and opulent districts where the shogunate elite enjoy Earthlike comforts, including simulated night cycles. However, beneath the glittering surface lies a darker reality: <strong>countless workers quietly live and die in service to the Shogunate</strong>. Players control <strong>Yuzuki</strong>, the sole surviving heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. After her family's destruction, she becomes an outlaw ronin and embarks on a blood-soaked path of vengeance through the lunar cities.</p>



<p>The developer, Chaos Manufacturing, places great importance on music for this project. The studio already announced collaborations with various artists, including Japanese rock band <strong>AliA</strong>. Following the unveiling, I reached out through PR and set up an interview with the founders, <strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong> (Game Director) and <strong>Guy Constantini</strong> (CEO), both of whom have extensive experience developing triple-A games. </p>



<p>It was a very intriguing conversation that made me even more interested in SOL Shogunate than I already was. As a reminder, <strong>the game is in early development</strong> for PC (you can already wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and consoles. It may take a few years before we can play it, especially since the team is very small.</p>

<h2 id="aaa-indie-origins">From AAA to Indie - The Origins of Chaos Manufacturing</h2>



<p><strong>Welcome! Tell us about your respective backgrounds.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leszek Szczepański:</strong> Sure. Hi, my name is Leszek Szczepański. I'm the Game Director at Chaos Manufacturing, which effectively means I drive the development effort. I gather a lot of talented and creative people and direct them in a way that helps us create this game. I've been in games for approaching 18 years. I'm Polish and worked in games in Poland for five years initially. Back in the day, I worked on mobile versions of <em>Metal Gear</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>, among others. After five years, I wanted to do bigger games. I looked around Europe and found Guerrilla Games in the Netherlands, part of PlayStation.</p>



<p>There, <strong>I worked on <em>Killzone Shadow Fall</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> almost from the beginning, and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></strong>. Over this time, I’ve been an engineer, a designer, managed a few gaming projects, and used to be a professional Dungeon Master. After all this, I realized it was time to build something of my own. Around that time, I got introduced to Guy. I realized he is the yin to my yang; we complement each other quite well, so we decided to get Chaos going together about two years ago.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I’m Guy Constantini. I am the General Manager and CEO (or "wrangler of cats") at Chaos Manufacturing. I make sure that if there's something that needs to be done, there is either a person to do it, or I have to do it myself. We met a couple of years ago and have been working on this ever since. I grew up in Milano and Monza, where my dad brought home an Atari 2600, which tells you how old I am. From there, I decided I needed to make my way to the States. I studied in New Jersey at Rutgers, but none of my initial jobs on the East Coast were in games. I realized I needed to get into the industry, so I moved to the West Coast and found this company called Riot Games. At the time, they were working on a little indie game called <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>



<p>I worked on that for a bit, then went to Kabam in San Francisco to work on <em>Marvel Contest of Champions</em>. I realized I didn't want to work in mobile games, so I came back down to Los Angeles to work for CD Projekt Red. <strong>I split my time between LA and Warsaw during the tail end of <em>The Witcher 3</em> and the beginning of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong>. From there, I went to Skydance Interactive and worked on <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em> (Chapter 1 and 2) and <em>Behemoth</em>.</p>



<p>Eventually, I realized I had brought games to every platform currently in use. I decided to see if I could start my own company and make the games I finally wanted to make for the rest of my life. I knew I needed a competent Game Director because, while I know how to build projects, I don't know how to build a game from scratch myself. </p>



<p><strong>You both have impressive credits. Guerrilla Games and CD Projekt Red are basically as AAA as it gets. Tell us more about Chaos Manufacturing. What kind of company did you envision, and how big is it? Is it remote or hybrid?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We learned a lot of lessons working on big and small projects. We always wanted to build something tight that punched above its weight. The idea was to find the right people because we think that if we do this correctly, those people will have wonderful lives.</p>



<p>Obviously, you have to have a concept for a company and cool games, but really, it's about the philosophy that drives us. We embrace the "chaos" of game development. I put it in the title so that if things ever feel frayed at the edges, we can point to the name!</p>



<p>We wanted to find autodidacts with a passion for knowledge. People who pursue mastery on their own. In a startup, you have to do things you're great at and things that simply need to be done. In exchange for this massive autonomy, we wanted to give people something worthwhile. Everyone in the company has at least a piece of what we're building. Eventually, once equity stops mattering, it'll be profit sharing. The idea is that people making the game should partake in the results of their success.</p>



<p><strong>We also wanted to give people ultimate flexibility. We don't want you to move across the ocean just to see if something works out. That's why right now we're pretty much remote</strong>. The intent isn't to be remote for the sake of it, but to ask the people how they want to work together and have the company adjust to them. A company is a group of people, so the people should inform how the company functions. We think that is a more sustainable way of building a business.</p>



<p><strong>We've been up to five people full-time, and that number fluctuates depending on where we are in our go-to-market path. We have a constellation of fractional people helping us out.</strong> One of my pet peeves is when people say, "This was a one-man job." It never really is. We will always credit the people involved. At the very core, I just want to treat people the way I want to be treated.</p>



<p><strong>Are you self-funded? I know it's a tough environment for the industry right now.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I joke that I picked the best and worst time to do this. I have learned a lot about how tough fundraising is. Everything we've raised so far has been from angels—small checks cobbled together to build things. We definitely have some financing partners that have come to the table recently.</p>



<p>Our approach has always been: find the right partners, raise the money we can, and build responsibly with that money. Our model allows us to only grow as much as we need. <strong>We could always use more funding, but I’d rather not start than take money from the wrong people</strong> and end up in a situation where we grow too much, things go wrong, and people are out of a job.</p>



<p><strong>Is the goal to self-publish, or would you consider a publisher?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I am very open to financing partners of various sorts. I know how to build a publisher; I've done so before efficiently. However, some publishers have capabilities I don't have. For the right partner, we are flexible, provided we retain creative control and they bring something to the table we lack. <strong>We don't have a publisher involved yet, but we are open to it depending on the partner</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-samurai-space-opera">SOL Shogunate: Creating a "Samurai Space Opera"</h2>



<p><strong>Moving on to the game, SOL Shogunate. The setting is quite interesting; space opera isn't usually connected to samurai. How did that idea come about?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The act of creation is inherently selfish. To create anything of value, you need to really believe in it, and to do that, you use the things you are passionate about. We looked at what we love: hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, near-future sci-fi, samurai fiction, Japanese music, and anime. We took these fascinations and put them together into a coherent whole. SOL Shogunate is what we call a "Samurai Space Opera," a mix of all these things we are passionate about.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We wanted to find a space that hadn't been explored a ton. <strong>We’ve seen samurai fiction and sci-fi alt-futures, but we wanted to architect a surreal future that feels fresh. We wanted to surprise people with the mix we put together.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, the idea came from a piece of concept art by a wonderful artist who works with us, <strong>Aaron Nakahara</strong> (Kobaltplasma). He had this stylized image of a warrior who looked like a traditional samurai but had a burning light in the middle of his face. It reminded me of times we've seen samurai or ninja aesthetics in the future where it felt like just a coat of paint. I wanted to build something with an intentional aesthetic that came from a specific reason.</p>



<p><strong>The protagonist, Yuzuki, is an outlaw out for revenge, which is a bit common nowadays. How do you plan to make her stand out compared to the average Ronin?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Honestly, the revenge part is just the first domino to fall. The story is not typical samurai fiction; it’s about unraveling mysteries regarding creation and destruction. The tragedy sets you on a path, but that path takes you to unexpected places.</p>



<p>Secondly, there is a reason we put Yuzuki in the future on the moon. She is a future samurai. The way she moves, fights, and looks is different. She has a sword, but also a thruster pack and grappling hooks, fighting in low gravity. We asked ourselves: "What is a future space samurai on the moon?"</p>



<p>Also, the idea of genetic modification is deeply ingrained in the story and setting. <strong>Yuzuki has unique genetic modifications. Her armor is inspired by samurai armor, but it's also part of her genetic augments that allow her to survive in the vacuum of space.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> If you read <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>, you know that to be a samurai means to become the ultimate warrior. We wanted to ask: what does someone who idolizes this ethos do when they have access to technology 200 years in the future, like personal jetpacks and bioceramic skin? What does that do to the ultimate warrior? We carved out a character that behaves differently from a warrior in feudal Japan or a standard sci-fi soldier.</p>



<p><b>Does she have ranged capabilities, or is she meant to be a melee-only character?</b></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The vast majority of her skills are based around melee weapons. <strong>She has grappling hooks to close the distance quickly</strong>. Through our upgrade system, she will unlock certain additional abilities, some of which might work at a distance, but ultimately these are there to enhance her fighting capabilities.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/211025_SolShogunate_ChaosManufacturing_Screenshot1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="gameplay-deep-dive">Gameplay Deep Dive - Music-Synced Battles and Genetic Upgrades</h2>



<p><strong>You mentioned unlocking skills. How does progression work in SOL Shogunate? Are there levels?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: We have two elements of character progression. The simpler one is finding different weapons and unlocking armors as the story progresses. The major element is our genetic upgrade system.</p>



<p><strong>We don't have a typical skill tree. Throughout the game, Yuzuki collects "Gene Slices" by defeating enemies or finding them in the environment.</strong> These connect to specific abilities or passive buffs. You equip these on a "Gene Board." Depending on how they are placed, they might interact with each other to unlock new abilities. You can also mutate genes together to create new combinations.</p>



<p>Realistically, every playthrough will be a little different regarding the skills and upgrades the player discovers. This feeds not only into combat but also into how she interacts with the world and the story.</p>



<p><strong>Can you respec these mutations, or are they permanent?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: You can reorganize your Gene Board at almost any point. However, once you mutate two genes to create a new one, the original two are consumed and gone.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>The intent is that you have to make decisions that can't be reversed</strong>, but there is a lot of flexibility in how you rearrange your build.</p>



<p><strong>One of the main official features is the multi-phase boss fights. You mentioned they are cinematic but dynamic. How do you plan to make them exciting?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Calling them just "boss fights" isn't precise; we think of them as epic set pieces. <strong>Some will be boss fights, but others might be elaborate encounters with multiple enemies.</strong> We treat these set pieces as puzzles; you need to figure out what tools you have and how to utilize them, similar to <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p>



<p>Since SOL Shogunate is a samurai space opera, music is fundamental. We are working with a number of Japanese rock bands to create specific music pieces for these encounters. A good song tells a story, and so does a good encounter. We want to synchronize them perfectly.</p>



<p>The music flows and evolves: intro, chorus, bridge. We ensure the encounter evolves exactly on the beat of the song. If a boss changes phases, it happens on the beat, and the music adds layers, like a choir or orchestra. I call it an "overwhelming cocktail of emotions," where the player is overwhelmed by what they see, hear, and interact with.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be difficulty levels so that players can customize the level of challenge in SOL Shogunate?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes. Our aim is to make a game that requires effort to finish, without overwhelming everyone. If you are a casual player, there will be an easy difficulty. If you want a proper challenge, there will be a hard mode.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>For those looking for a challenge, the harder difficulties will require you to really dig for ways to overcome enemies</strong>. Our systems are interlocking; once you understand them, you become stronger. I personally like games that "beat my face into the ground," so there will be something for that type of gamer.</p>



<p><strong>Regarding the narrative and space opera aspects, how are you tackling exposition and world-building?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: SOL Shogunate is a Japanese-style Action RPG, so we focus on strong characters and a vibrant world. We want to create the Moon (and maybe something larger later) full of life, factions, and people with their own stories. We want an intricate story with mysteries, misdirection, and puzzles, set in a rich world with conflicting truths.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> The premise, a samurai caste in charge of humanity, is just the tip of the iceberg. You have large rotating city biomes inside the moon with simulated gravity connected by train lines. Outside is the dangerous lunar surface with remnants of a solar system-wide war.</p>



<p><strong>The story is about two characters. Yuzuki is the primary playable character, but it’s a story of two people from different walks of life whose worldviews are shattered and pieced back together</strong>. Yuzuki’s skin is reminiscent of <em>Kintsugi</em> (repairing pottery with gold) because she is the "shattered heir" rebuilding herself. We believe in storytelling through gameplay, including artifacts, radio comms, and cinematics.</p>



<p><strong>Just to clarify, only Yuzuki is playable?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, correct.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on the scope? 15-20 hours, maybe?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We aren't ready to talk about specific length or pricing yet, but philosophically, <strong>we think the world wants quality over quantity</strong>. Everyone has a stack of unplayed games that are hundreds of hours long. We want strong gameplay quality and visual fidelity that respects your time and wallet. It will definitely be beyond 10 hours, priced generously.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SOL-Shogunate-Assembly-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="tech-philosophy-stance-AI">Tech &amp; Philosophy - Unreal Engine 5 and the Studio's Stance on AI</h2>



<p><strong>Are you talking about a launch on next-gen consoles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We want people on all kinds of devices to play. We are definitely coming to PC and Console. We’re developing controller-first, but PC will have a strong keyboard configuration. We want to build something tight, like <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, and if players want more, we’ll make <em>Arkham City</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, it’s not a secret that we are working on Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>I noticed the Steam page previously had minimum requirements like a GTX 970, which seemed way too low.</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Apologies, that was an error. We removed them. We aren't at a stage to talk about target requirements yet.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> That was my fault! But generally, we want to make games that run on a wide range of hardware, though obviously, they will look incredible on the latest gear.</p>



<p><strong>A bonus question about the recent controversy with Larian regarding AI usage. What is your stance on AI?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>Our game art is handcrafted</strong>. Our principal concept artist went couch surfing all over Japan to take pictures to build worlds inspired by real life. I like to let artists inform what tools they use, not tell them to use something just to save a buck. So far, our artists say making things by hand works best.</p>



<p>That said, anyone who says they know what they’ll be doing in two years is lying. Technology changes. If a new tool is great and artists love it, no problem. But right now, we prioritize the handcrafted approach.</p>



<p><strong>Nice. Well, thank you both for the lovely chat.</strong></p>

              <p>This year’s Winter Olympics have been some of the coolest to watch, thanks to some talented drone operators providing viewers at home and online with awesome shots of some of the Games’ fastest events.</p> <p>Drones with cameras have been used to record sporting events for over a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wYFdh1w_n6M">But due to a dangerous near-miss incident in 2015</a>, drones have basically been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/sports/skiing/drones-banned-at-world-cup-races-after-one-nearly-hits-marcel-hirscher.html">banned from most skiing and snowboarding events for years</a>. However, the tech has come a long way since that moment, and drones are smaller, more reliable, and safer than ever before. So the tech is a big feature of this year’s Winter Olympics presentation on NBC and other affiliated networks. The end results are <a href="https://x.com/nascarcasm/status/2020269499879158039">truly stunning</a> to look at.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The greatest new use of tech for the Olympics is this drone view behind the women’s downhill skiers. The intensity and speed, can’t be grasped from any of the other cameras we’re used to. Excellent.</p> <p>Now give me that in Apple Vision Pro. <a href="https://t.co/EtqgTkeYFq">pic.twitter.com/EtqgTkeYFq</a></p> <p>— Lee Parayno (@leeparayno) <a href="https://twitter.com/leeparayno/status/2020713318475071563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You don’t really understand how fast these athletes are going when you see them from a static camera angle as they rush down a mountain or skate across ice. But when a drone is flying right behind them, keeping up, it provides an incredible new look at these turbo-charged winter sports. Like, look at how fast this snowboarder is flying down the mountain!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Drone Winter Olympics 🙌 <a href="https://t.co/qTjwMpiNIq">pic.twitter.com/qTjwMpiNIq</a> <a href="https://t.co/aniABheDmR">https://t.co/aniABheDmR</a></p> <p>— Eric Njiru ⚽️ (@EricNjiiru) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricNjiiru/status/2020462950935351803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Or look at how quickly these speed skaters zip around the ice.</p>   <p>I’ll admit that I was nervous that the drones might cause problems for the athletes, but according to many, they don’t notice the buzzing noise, and as long as they stay safely away, they don’t cause any issues. These drones are also operated by skilled pilots who work alongside a dedicated technician and director to ensure the athletes’ safety while capturing these jaw-dropping views.</p> <p>“When a camera is chasing the athlete down the hill — right in front of them or right behind them — you truly get the sense of how fast they’re going,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2026/02/09/drones-winter-olympics/">said Michael Sheehan, the coordinating director for NBC’s Olympic coverage</a>. “That’s virtually impossible to capture with a wide shot shooting from the side. The drone coverage takes us to a place we’ve traditionally never been.”</p>

 <p>All I can think about while looking at these clips of drones speeding behind athletes is: I want sports games that look like this, please!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, is getting a major update tomorrow (1.0.2) that will introduce the long-awaited Escape from Duckov collaboration content. We still don’t know what that looks like, but it marks the first cross-game collaboration in a hot minute for Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Battlestate announced an impending outage that will take Tarkov offline for up to six hours tomorrow, February 10.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-first-major-collaboration-is-coming">Tarkov’s First Major Collaboration is Coming</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, the teams at both Team Soda (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-duckov/" id="2714">Escape from Duckov</a>) and Battlestate Games (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a>) have been teasing a cross-platform collaboration. It promises to introduce crossover content in <strong>both games</strong>, despite the former title being a <strong>parody </strong>of the latter.</p>



<p>It looks like Escape from Tarkov’s maps will be replicated in Escape from Duckov, and the duck-themed characters from Duckov will surface <strong>in some way </strong>in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tomorrow, February 10 at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patch 1.0.2.0 for Escape from Tarkov. The installation will take between 4 and 6 hours, but may be extended if required. The game will be unavailable during this time.</p><p>The official websites… <a href="https://t.co/lkoojEGgyk">pic.twitter.com/lkoojEGgyk</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2020890440648573414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>We have no idea how long this collaboration is set to run for, but it’s likely to be a limited-time event that will expire after a few days. As with past Escape from Tarkov LTMs, it’s likely players will have achievements, items, and other rewards to unlock that, if they don’t get them now, they’ll never see them again.</p>



<p>You can expect Escape from Tarkov to be offline tomorrow from 7 AM GMT to at least 11 AM GMT, and <strong>most likely </strong>until 1 PM GMT. In true Tarkov style, you should also anticipate an extension to the maintenance window. To play it safe, perhaps wait until around 2 PM GMT for Escape from Tarkov to come back up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" id="52298">Riot Games</a> has downsized the team working on its League of Legends-themed fighting game, 2XKO.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">A blog post on February 9</a>, which was written by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/2xko/" id="1323">2XKO </a>executive producer Tom Cannon, revealed that the difficult decision to downsize the team was made in response to emerging trends. While the game has resonated with a core audience, momentum has stagnated, and Riot Games is unable to support a full-size team long-term.</p>



<p><span>A Riot Games spokesperson t</span>old <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>&nbsp;that approximately 80 staff members were laid off, about half of the development team.</p>



<p>The post states that, with the smaller, “focused” team, they will still make key improvements to the game, including items players have already requested. It is reiterated that this is a shift in how the development team will operate, not a sign that “the journey is over” for the 2XKO team.</p>



<p>“This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward,” Cannon wrote.</p>







<h2 id="h-riot-games-offering-support-to-laid-off-2xko-staff">Riot Games Offering Support to Laid-Off 2XKO Staff</h2>



<p>Furthermore, the blog noted that Riot Games will support staff through their transition, help them explore other opportunities within the company where possible, and provide at least 6 months of notice pay and severance where that’s not possible.</p>



<p>2XKO entered Early Access on PC on October 7, 2025, and launched across all platforms on January 20. Canon explained that during the console expansion, concerning player trends emerged. </p>



<p>Plans for the 2026 competitive series remain unchanged, and Riot will continue to focus on supporting events and organizers in local and broader communities.</p>







<p>Unfortunately, layoffs are currently a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft is undergoing a major restructuring, which has led to the cancellation of many projects, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">planned remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> and<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" id="174712"> a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed title.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to bring the latest updates on this story as more information becomes available.</p>

This is a difficult update to share, but we want to be clear about what’s changing and why.</p><p><strong>What’s Changing and Why</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the <em>2XKO</em> team.</p><p>I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.</p><p>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</p><p>Our plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged. We remain committed to partnering with tournament organizers and local communities. Our focus will continue to be on supporting the events and organizers that already power the FGC.</p><p>Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate. This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.</p><p><strong>About the People Behind the Game</strong></p><p>I want to be clear about something that matters deeply to me.</p><p>The people who helped ship <em>2XKO</em> poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game. Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful.</p><p>We’re committed to supporting impacted Rioters through this transition—including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of six months of notice pay and severance where it’s not.</p><p><strong>Going Forward</strong></p><p>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</p><p>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the <em>2XKO</em> community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</p><p>Thank you for playing <em>2XKO</em>, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community.</p><p>—Tom Cannon</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/2xko-team-to-downsize-following-lackluster-launch]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The trick to most roguelites is your mastery of a particular deck or build. Whether it’s your cast of characters, deck of cards, or collection of spells, progress is gained as much from incremental additions as it is from your increased skill at playing that build. Chances are you’ve dedicated a huge amount of time to one specific build in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, or a preferred range of Jokers in&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, such that next time you head out you’re both better equipped and better acquainted to cope with the familiar path of enemies, challenges and incidents. <em>Mewgenics</em>, the latest game from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, responds to this format by saying, “What if we screwed that all up and threw it in the trash?” Oh, and added, “And threw in as much toilet humor as we possibly can?” The result, I’m delighted to report, is really rather impressive.</p> <p><em>Mewgenics</em> (out February 10 on Steam) is a <em>Slay the Spire</em>-style roguelite but with turn-based RPG-like battles played out on a small grid. For each run you take a group of four kitty-cats, each with their own roll of skill numbers, who are then assigned a class before the run begins. You then make your way through an ever-longer series of maps, each with battles, mystery situations, random treasures and boss fights, using your crew of cats and their somewhat randomly assigned sets of abilities, until you’ve figured out how to combine them as an incredibly effective team. Win the fights, defeat the most distant boss, and you’ll return to your home to, oh no, have all four of them (if they lived) retire. They’ll never fight again. All those skills you learned, the ways you figured out how to allow them to buff one another, a particular one-two combo you found to be especially effective? That’s gone now. Time to start over.</p>

 <p>That sounds rough, but the point is, you managed all those things, gained all that ability, on that single run. You can do it again, with four different cats with different skills, and perhaps different classes (you assign cats with specific class-granting collars before you begin, picking from, say, Mage, Thief, Fighter and Hunter, with more collars becoming available the more you play), and find a whole new way for a new crew to come together. Once. Of course, at the same time that you’re still gaining all the knowledge, you’re still getting better at the game, just not perhaps in the way that’s quite so familiar.</p>   <p>You get more cats, by the way, through the magic of nature. After picking two cats from a mad scientist, leaving them alone together overnight can cause—well look, when a mummy cat and daddy cat love each other very much, they fuck and make a baby. And your retired vets (they hate that term) will breed, passing on their genetics to a new generation of battle-cats. So long as you have enough food to feed all the feline inhabitants of your home, you can keep on breeding as many as you wish, then pick four to take with you on your next adventure.</p>

 <p>Cats that are no longer useful to you are, um, given away. Via sewer pipes, to a range of unsavory types who want the cats for…look, it’s best not to ask questions. But give each of these unsavory types enough and they’ll bestow you with useful advantages: a bigger home, more food storage,</p>

 <p>And so it goes on. Play more, reach further, unlock more, play more, reach further, unlock more, in that idyllic cycle that marks the best of this genre. I have no doubt that&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is going to prove a massive hit, given it delivers in all those incredibly hooky ways while having a fresh approach with its constant new teams. This is made even more impressive by the sheer amount of variety on each run, with different mini-bosses appearing, new enemy types showing up, unique events, completely new sets of spells and skills getting assigned, and indeed brand new songs being performed in the midst of your encounters. Oh yes, it’s kinda a musical too.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666941" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666941"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666941">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, I do take issue with some of the design. It’s possible to get phenomenally unlucky in ways that seem to undermine the ethos of the game. Random events like the Sandstorm are absolutely ruinous to a run, where every battle sees swirling sand deliver one damage to every character in the battle every round. That sounds innocuous enough, until you’re in a position where your kitties are very low on health, and reviving any who have been knocked out likely only brings them up to one health. That’s an infuriating cycle to be stuck in, and it’s a persistent effect that ruins your whole run. Not least because replacement cats tend to be pretty much useless, at which point it all stops being fun.</p>

 <p>Combine a situation like that with a mini-boss that has a 50-percent chance of avoiding hits and a run of bad luck with that, and it feels so hopeless you want to give up. But this means wiping out your whole team, losing all the coins, food and artifacts they’ve gathered, and means having to breed more cats to set out again. When all of this happened to me, I was also low on food, and then for some godforsaken reason I had three nights in a row when the cats refused to breed. So, um, it’s time to head off with the four random strays and hope. You can’t actually <em>lose</em>, because at a certain point it just forces you to have four cats and the opportunity to go on a run, but eurgh.</p> <p>I encountered so much bad luck that I began to get too frustrated. There’s an attack that’s supposed to hit 30 percent of the time. I’ve seen it hit <em>once</em> out of maybe 590 billion uses. In my direst straits I ended up with a strain of genetics in my kitties that saw them born as “pacifists” and thus unable to kill enemies—that’s a problem. Coincidences, terrible strings of coin-flips, and enemies deciding to take seven turns in a row start racking up to the point where I was just the helpless victim of the game’s RNG, in a game where the odds are already deliberately stacked against you. I started resenting <em>Mewgenics</em> instead of enjoying it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666943" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666943"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666943">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Like I say, this isn’t a condemnation of the game—it’s very obviously an extremely good one, and it delivers on its goals in vast bucketfuls. It’s wonderfully drawn, incredibly silly, and amazingly inventive. And it has so many completely fabulous songs. And look at the top: this isn’t a review! It’s up to someone willing to dedicate the hundred or more hours this game seems to need to write that. Me, I just got a bit fed up of its brutality after a bit, and while I’m still afflicted by a desire for “just one more go,” I’m also a bit cross with it too.</p>

 <p>I’m so interested to see how its toilet humor lands. It’s&nbsp;<em>so</em> childish in all the best ways, with incessant poop and pee gags, splendidly unpleasant depictions of cats rutting, giving birth, and eating one another, and even songs to go with such moments (I don’t know if it’s called “Cannibal Kitty” but that’s my favorite). It also has scenarios in which your cats can choose to eat human fetuses, spiders that crawl inside enemies and eat them from the inside out, all sorts of delightfully gross-out stuff. Although, I should add, this is far more tempered than in previous McMillen games: it’s practically a work of maturity compared to <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>‘s sensibilities. Tyler Glaiel (<em>The End Is Nigh</em>, <em>Bombernauts</em>) must be a good influence on him.&nbsp;I’m fascinated to learn how the traditional audience for a game like <em>Monster Train</em>,&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dicey Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach</em>, and so on will react to the crassness.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666944"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666944">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I also think I would have a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more time for&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> if it were on Android and iOS. This feels like the perfect game to play on my Pixel tablet, where I’d far more comfortably while away time with a run here and a run there, rather than sitting at my PC. (Obviously the Steam Deck is an option, but not the same.) It seems a mighty odd choice to limit this to PC on release.</p>

 <p><em>Mewgenics</em> reveals a colossal amount of work that has gone into making it so incredibly variable, and it’s very rewarding with all the decorative extras that surround the core loop. Its humor will <em>definitely</em> be a miss for many, but I suspect its depth and difficulty will give many cause to rise above it and play anyway. I just need some time to calm down before I go back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>From </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-secret-lair-baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-gale-2000665414"><i><span>Magic</span></i></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/even-trumps-pentagon-is-selling-rare-pokemon-cards-now-2000661388"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>, trading card games are having a moment right now. Yeah, the popularity comes with some drawbacks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><span>awful online queues</span></a><span>, but it’s clear that there’s a market to jump into if you’re putting popular characters and good art on pieces of cardboard. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suspended-hearthstone-player-blitzchung-doesnt-regret-s-1841191499"><i><span>Hearthstone</span></i></a><span>, Blizzard’s </span><i><span>Warcraft</span></i><span> card game, has existed as a digital game for over a decade. Is Blizzard planning on jumping into this booming business? Not yet, at least.</span></p> <p><span>In a roundtable interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith and game director Tyler Bielman were asked if Blizzard had been considering bringing </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to physical card shops. According to Bielman, a lot of what makes the game special comes from qualities its digital platform enables that can’t be replicated with real cards, and the team is wary of losing some of those elements in translation.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>I’ll start with, we have nothing to announce today. The team [has many] big physical TCG players. I came from physical TCGs; our friends at Riot and </span><i><span>Riftbound </span></i><span>are having a moment. It’s great for them. From the very beginning, our “founding fathers” of </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>asked the question of, “What if you could remove all the pain points from physical play?” and, at that point, kind of looking at </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> as the foundational element, ‘[if you could] remove pain points around </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, too?’ And they asked all these questions, and then they put this game together in a way that is [an] incredible digital [experience]. The things that we do, mechanically, that you can’t do on a tabletop, when we go to look at expansions and new mechanics, we value those really highly. It gets a little extra oomph from us if it’s something that is unique to the digital format. If you were to translate </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>into a physical format, you would be sacrificing a lot of things that make it special. Now that said, the core of what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>a great game is pretty universal and very accessible, and that’s why we believe it’s been around for 12 years, but I think that we would lose so much in that translation, we would have to be really careful about defining for ourselves what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>great in the minds of all the players and then how much of that could we recapture if we take it to a different platform at all.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Lyons-Smith added that Blizzard wants </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to be positioned as the “best digital card game,” and that is the team’s focus, but also said that the company has been around for 35 years and a lot has changed in that time, so the company has a “long horizon” of research and development that it’s exploring. So while it has “nothing to announce” and “nothing actually even in development,” the team is happy to see the card game genre growing.</span></p> <p><span>Today, Blizzard held its </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>Spotlight presentation that laid out the game’s incoming updates, including an update based on </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Cataclysm </span></i><span>expansion, which you can watch below:</span></p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/activision-blizzard-hack-maker-zenith-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1430422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Activision Blizzard is suing two alleged <em>Call of Duty</em> hack makers who—despite several cease-and-desists—won't stop making hacks, according to a new lawsuit. The company is also targeting the people who sell their hacking software. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/995333407/Activision-Blizzard-Snitched-To-Hack-Maker-s-Mom?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Activision Blizzard filed a complaint in California</u></a> on Friday targeting the makers of two&nbsp; <em>Call of Duty</em> hacks called Zenith and Devware. The hackers, known online as Wolfy and Noziex, have sold more than 28,000 licenses for the Zenith hack since September 2025, according to Activision Blizzard's complaint.</p><p>Lawyers say the Zenith hack is responsible for a recent exploit that took down five <em>Call of Duty</em> servers in May. Zenith allows players to target enemies, see through walls to better locate enemy players, and access all in-game items. It also includes what Activision Blizzard's lawyers call a "rage" feature that lets the cheating player kick others from multiplayer servers—"or to crash Activision's dedicated multiplayer servers," write the lawyers, which happened in May. Activision Blizzard has been trying to stop the two hackers since 2023, sending several cease-and-desist letters to the hackers <em>and</em> by calling one of the hackers' mothers to alert her of her son's behavior.</p><p>Wolfy, whose real name is Julian Angel Valenzuela, and Noziex, who is called A.R. in the complaint because he's a minor, started working together in 2023 on an earlier version of Zenith called Devware. Devware was popular, lawyers say, because it gave players access to paid cosmetic items for free. They continued to add features to the Devware hack, including the ability to disconnect players. "In other words, by using the Devware Hack, mean-spirited players could harass others by causing them to lose their connection to the COD Games or cause their COD Games' software to crash or stop working," lawyers write. Not only does this kick players from matches, but the disconnected players can get punished for leaving games early.</p><p>Activision Blizzard lawyers say the two sold "tens or hundreds of thousands of copies" of the hack. Activision Blizzard sent its first cease-and-desist, according to the complaint, in 2024. Wolfy, in response, posted online that Activision Blizzard "can't stop me and I aint stopping." Noziex joked about making shirts of the cease-and-desist. They continued to sell hacks, Activision Blizzard lawyers say.</p><p>In June 2024, Activision Blizzard lawyers called Wolfy's mom and told her about her son's behavior online. Activision Blizzard counsel called again days later and spoke to someone who claimed to be a brother's friend, per the complaint. That day, Activision Blizzard's lawyers called the home again and spoke to the mother, "who claimed to have no memory of the conversation four days prior," lawyers wrote in the complaint. Wolfy shut down the Devware server shortly after, saying that he was complying with a cease-and-desist from Activision Blizzard.</p><p>But Activision Blizzard claims he did not stop selling hacks. The complaint claims that the two hackers pretended to sell the Devware Discord server to another company, which lawyers say was a "front"&nbsp; to start selling a new hack—the Zenith hacking software, which basically included the same features as the Devware hack. They partnered with hack resellers to sell the software, lawyers say. Websites linked in the complaint appear to be no longer active, but a version of the Zenith hack appears to sell for $50 for a three-month subscription on third-party cheating websites.&nbsp;</p><p>Activision Blizzard sent another cease-and-desist in March 2025, and Wolfy again posted online that he's not "providing any services related to Activision Publishing," per the complaint. Activision Blizzard's lawyers say nothing's changed in his behavior since then—and then there were the "two high-profile cyber-attacks which caused the multiplayer servers for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em>" to crash. Activision Blizzard's lawyers say Wolfy used Zenith to do those attacks. In November 2025, Activision Blizzard sent <em>another</em> cease-and-desist letter. He didn't respond, Activision Blizzard's lawyers say, and instead Wolfy posted online: "I AM BACK."</p><p>Activision Blizzard's lawyers say the hacking software has caused "loss of player revenues," and has forced the company to spend lots of time and money on taking on the hackers, banning users who use the software, and employing people to "police the games to detect the COD Hacks." The damage, lawyers say, is in the millions of dollars.</p><p>Lawyers are asking the court to force the two hackers to stop making hacking software, and for the resellers to stop selling them and to destroy the software. They're also looking for damages for trafficking in circumvention devices, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, intentional interference with contractual relations, and unfair competition.</p><p>In 2024, Activision <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-awarded-14-5-million-in-call-of-duty-cheatmaker-suit?ref=aftermath.site"><u>won a $14.5 million judgement against the makers of a hack called EngineOwning</u></a>. The company is also suing 24-year-old Tennessee man Ryan Rothholz for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-25/call-of-duty-activision-blizzard-hacking-lawsuit?ref=aftermath.site"><u>his alleged role in creating the Lergware hacking software</u></a>. That case is ongoing; in February, the court denied Rothholz's motion to dismiss. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been months since Epic Games <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-creepy-horror-game-steam-banned-before-launch-santa-ragione-2000647324">removed <em>Horses</em> from its PC storefront</a> and the two sides are still feuding about what exactly took place. Developer Santa Ragione claims it was ghosted by Epic while the </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>maker claims it’s been transparent throughout the process. Now Santa Ragione’s co-founder and studio director, Pietro Righi Riva, has responded to the response to the response, claiming Epic Games’ “vague and semi-automated statements” provided little in the way of meaningful feedback about why</span><i><span> Horses </span></i><span>was removed from the storefront.</span></p> <p><span>This latest chapter in the ongoing censorship fight began with </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game?open=false#%C2%A7a-note-about-horses"><i><span>Game File’s</span></i></a><span> February 5 interview with Epic Games, in which it asked VP Steve Allison why the game was taken down. “My understanding is the trust and safety team thought </span><i><span>[Horses</span></i><span>] was worth taking a fresh look, and they determined that it indeed was against our policies on a couple fronts,” Allison said. “And so, the call came late—and we love that studio; we did their previous game as a short exclusive—but because that [trust and safety] team, that’s their job and that is, if you do the letter of the law on our policies, it is what it is.”</span></p>

 <p><span>For context, Epic Games’ content ratings </span><a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines"><span>guidelines</span></a><span> state that games “with Adults Only (AO) ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store.” They do make an exception for games that only carry AO ratings “because they use blockchain, NFT, or cryptocurrency technology.” </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is also not available through Steam for similar reasoning, but can be purchased on GoG and itch.io.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/app.bsky.feed.post/3mebdquhjts2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreieobrr7wsfjrlwzargszax3mipgo43vus3xdgurceeb4qayvzrpxq"> <p lang="en">Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn?ref_src=embed">Santa Ragione (@santaragione.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/post/3mebdquhjts2k?ref_src=embed">2026-02-07T11:44:28.467Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>On February 7, Santa Ragione rejected Allison’s claim in a post </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdquhjts2k"><span>on Bluesky</span></a><span>. “Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us,” stated Santa Ragione.</span></p>

 <p><span>Today, Epic Games followed up on Santa Ragione’s post in a statement to several publications, including </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” communications manager Brian Sharon said.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place.”</span></p> <h2>A cloud of confusion still hangs over <em>Horses</em>‘ last-minute rejection</h2> <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>reached out to Santa Ragione for clarification regarding the “incorrect statements” they alluded to in their initial Bluesky post. “On Dec 1, 24 hours before release, Epic sent us what looked like an automated notice saying that they were unable to distribute </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span> on the Epic Games Store because their review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” replied Pietro Righi Riva. “They went on to specify that their policies prohibit content which ‘contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated,’ and content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riva further explained that they responded to Epic Games’ first notice to appeal within “28 minutes,” on the basis that “all nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation” and that “the content presented does not in any way promote abuse and animal abuse.” After Epic Games’ second review of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, Riva told us that “No additional information or context was ever provided. We emailed them twice since to plead for a resubmission and find a solution but never received a reply.”</span></p> <p><span>“I do not think that those two vague and semi-automated statements would qualify as ‘contacting us twice.’ Their initial message suggested there was a path to ‘make updates to our product to ensure compliance’ but never explained what that would entail or what specifically needed change in the first place,” Riva concluded.</span></p> <p><span><em>Horses</em> has received </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><span>a range of reviews</span></a><span> since it launched, but one thing many critics seems to agree on is that there is nothing in the game nearly as scandalous as Epic and Valve banning it would imply. Adding to the confusion and skepticism is that PC gaming storefronts have been under extra pressure recently from payment processers at the behest of pro-censorship activists to crackdown on NSFW content. For all the controversy, Epic and other storefronts still haven’t made it clear precisely what they found so objectionable about the content in</span><i><span> Horses</span></i><span>.&nbsp; </span></p>
