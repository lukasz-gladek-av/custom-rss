</div></figure></div>
<p>So let's take a look at the new information...</p>
<h2>Yakuza Kiwami 3</h2>
<p><strong>- Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami Style Combat –</strong>Players can now enjoy the most attack techniques in the series' history and brand-new Heat Abilities in addition to fan favourites from the original Yakuza 3.</p>
<p><strong>- Ryukyu Style Combat –</strong> Rooted in Okinawan martial arts, this battle style’s base stance utilises a tinbe and rochin, a traditional shield and short spear. Simply mash or hold down the buttons to weave in flashy sai, nichogama, tonfa, tekko, nunchaku, eiku, and surujin attacks. Kiryu can power up by maxing out his gauge and activating his Dragon Boost.</p>
<p><strong>- Ability Upgrades –</strong> Kiryu's ability upgrades now give him access to his most diverse skill set to date. Complete missions and undergo training to mold Kiryu as you see fit or customise his cell phone to boost his motivation, taking his abilities to new heights.</p>

<h2>Dark Ties</h2>
<p><strong>- Mine’s Story</strong> <strong>–</strong>The year is 2007. Yoshitaka Mine had once launched a successful startup, only to be stabbed in the back by a trusted partner. Wandering Kamurocho in a drunken stupor, he witnesses a gruesome conflict between yakuza factions. After watching a subordinate of Daigo Dojima sacrifice themselves, Mine longs to discover what makes a bond transcend material gain.</p>
<p>He approaches Tsuyoshi Kanda of the Tojo Clan's Nishikiyama Family in hopes of learning more about Daigo. Kanda welcomes him in as his sworn brother and right-hand man. Working in tandem, they bring significant wealth into the family's coffers. Soon, the Tojo Clan catches wind of Mine and Kanda's actions and springs into action. As Mine and Kanda navigate their way through this crisis, Mine begins to feel a sense of kinship toward Kanda and shortly after receives a sudden invitation from Daigo Dojima.</p>
<p>-<strong>Ruthless Combat –</strong> An elegant fighting style based on shoot-boxing, players can exploit openings in their opponent's defence to deliver refined combos and beat down enemies, and dash freely through the air to overwhelm foes with unpredictable movement.</p>
<p>- <strong>Dark Awakening Mode –</strong> Mine builds up his Shackled Heart by attacking enemies and can spend it to trigger Dark Awakening, a mode that empowers Mine. Using Dark Awakening, Mine drops his facade, revealing his true ferocity and transforming his battle animations and techniques. Mine possesses many stylish, cold-blooded Heat Actions, including an all-out barrage to the face and a brutal gut punch.</p>
<p>- <strong>Ability Upgrades –</strong> Mine's upgrades refine his combat abilities, improving his techniques and unlocking mid-air Heat Actions. A number of upgrades to Dark Awakening are also available.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-finishes-what-tears-of-the-kingdom-started.1345756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though my 100-plus-hour completed save file would beg to differ, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> is an unfinished game. Think of it like Korean barbecue. Without the kimchi, rice, sprouts, or sauce, it’s just meat — tasty meat to be sure, but not a complete (or healthy) dinner. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638770/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></a> is the missing banchan in this analogy. Some of it’s delicious, some not, and though it’s not strong enough to stand on its own, if you combine it with some <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> pork belly, you get a fantastic, well-rounded meal.</p><p><em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is a hack-and-slash game (also known as a musou) that recounts Zelda’s half of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s story. Players can fight as a number of characters from Hyrule’s ancient past, like King Rauru, his scientist sister Mineru, the legendary leaders of Hyrule’s different races, and a number of mysterious and important figures including Princess Zelda herself. Combat takes place on different maps where you and up to two other characters mow down scores of weak enemies, mid-bosses, and big bosses, each defeat slowly turning the map from enemy red to ally blue.</p><p>Musou games have a reputation as mindless button mashers. But <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> layers together basic combat mechanics that wouldn’t be interesting on their own to create depth that’s simple but entertaining. Execute combos by stringing together light and heavy attacks. You can augment those basic combos further by sprinkling in item attacks, special abilities, and powerful sync strikes, which let you pair up with an ally for a slick-looking, health-bar melting, enemy clearing ultimate attack.</p><p>Instead of just whaling on minions and bosses, I have to think about how I fight. If I use Zelda’s arrow of light ability carelessly, it won’t be ready in time when I need to counter an enemy’s special aerial attack. If I spend too much time in a battle playing Zelda, ignoring my other teammates who I can swap to at any time, they won’t have built up their special meters enough for a sync strike. To be sure, this ain’t <em>Silksong</em> levels of complexity (or difficulty), but it’s just enough to keep me pleasantly engaged.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-the-kotaku-review-1845702074">the map that I hated from <em>Age of Calamity</em></a> is back, once again littered with glowing markers all flashing for your attention. There are the main story and side missions where all the fighting happens, and those are fine. But every little piece of character progression is denoted with its own individual icon. If you want to upgrade Zelda’s health, there’s an icon on the map for that, same for expanding her combo string. Expand that across every single character, (I’m currently up to eight but there are rumors of anywhere between 14 and 16 playable characters) and you’ve got a map that:</p><div><ol><li><span>Looks like it has way more stuff going on than it does</span></li><li><span>Immediately drives you insane when you look at it</span></li></ol></div><p><em>Breath</em> and <em>Tears</em> have exceedingly busy maps too, but in those games icons indicate that whatever is there — a shrine I’ve discovered or a shop — is a valuable place that I can revisit if I need to. In this game, outside of the handful of necessities like the weaponsmith and training center, those icons represent “quests” that strain the definition of the term. There’s no task to undertake or requirement to fulfill — you get the materials, often already in your inventory, and turn ’em in. It’s maddening and makes you feel like half the game is just marking off a shopping list.</p><p>Like <em>Age of Calamity</em> before it, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> does a fantastic job of bringing elements from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and adapting them to the musou format. Any character can use Zonai devices like bombs or rockets to do some damage, and even the weirder, less martially inclined ones like the fire hydrant or fan have their uses. Investigating out-of-place-looking things reveals Koroks, some characters can fuse monster parts to their weapons for extra oomph, and you can use food and other materials to temporarily enhance your stats. Crossover games like this often suffer because they’re little more than so much of a franchise’s lipstick on a musou pig. But<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> does the work to convince you that this hack-and-slash formula fits in a universe and genre it wasn’t originally designed for.</p><p>The story fits too. Though I enjoyed <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, something that diminished the game was its treatment of Princess Zelda. Early trailers, with her standing side by side with Link, torch in hand as they investigated ruins, convinced me that she would feature more prominently than she did in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. Instead, Nintendo immediately isekai’d her, only for her to appear briefly in cutscenes and at the very end as essentially the Master Sword delivery mechanism. They made the Princess of Hyrule into the literal Latin-derived definition of a vagina, and I’ve quietly carried a blood feud ever since.</p><p>In <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>, we see Zelda go on the journey I had hoped to see in <em>TotK</em>. We get to see her fight, fail, and learn as she comes into her powers as a priestess of time. She is finally a capable participant in the action around her rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">magical Macguffin</a> that drives it. While Link was using the Ultrahand ability to cobble together <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23732888/tears-of-the-kingdom-builds-crafting-wildest">Korok death machines</a>, Zelda was, very literally, studying the blade.</p><p>And I like that though Zelda is the main character, her allies get their due as well. I enjoyed King Rauru and his wife, Queen Sonia, being so cute using their respective powers to fight together while calling each other “dear” and making heart eyes mid-battle. Calamo, an adventurous little Korok, might be the MVP of the squad, but as I continue through the story I worry his companion, the mysterious Construct, will prove to be just some version of Link.</p><div><p>While Link was using the Ultrahand ability to cobble together Korok death machines, Zelda was, very literally, studying the blade</p></div><p>The very nature of a musou requires a deep cast of characters to play as. And rather than have everyone but Zelda and King Rauru exist as mere set dressing, the developers at Koei Tecmo smartly used <em>Age of Imprisonment </em>to tell other characters’ stories. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> are as loved as they are for their vast, lifelike worlds. Part of reinforcing that realness and depth is highlighting the lives of people who weren’t voted Hyrule’s Cutest Couple Great Plateau High Class of ’17, and <em>Age of Imprisonment </em>does that well.</p><p>I know not everyone can rock with the hack-and-slash format, but <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is worth your time if you love this flavor of the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> series. The next mainline installment is probably a long way off, and I doubt we’re coming back to this version of Hyrule. But rather than leave fans hungry, Nintendo fed us with what is essentially a sequel less than two years later that is different enough to be interesting, familiar enough to not seem alienating, and with a canon story that will make the lore sickos like me happy.</p><p><sub><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> launches November 6th for Nintendo Switch 2.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/814762/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I'm about an hour into Whiskerwood, the new city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> from Minakata Dynamics and publishers Hooded Horse, and I've already made an absolute mess of my coastline. A clever and charismatic hybrid of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a>, Robin Jarvis novels and the settlement of North America, Whiskerwood puts you in charge of some mice building colonies on cuboid islands. The islands are lovely so far, their Minecrafty nooks and crannies crying out to be decked with gardens and windmills and cobblestone paths. But you've got taxes to pay, so the first thing you do is sink a bunch of mineshafts at random, scooping out coal and copper for the literal fat cats back at court. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
My island town currently looks like it's been attacked by termites, though I'm trying to instigate some Cosiness by populating the bedraggled shore with nice chubby cottages. I've had to abandon my grand plans for a dockfront cafe for the moment, but perhaps we can circle back to the gentrification stuff once I've stripped the caves of gold and hacked down all the trees.

<p>
You don't have to pay your taxes - shucking off the feline yoke appears to be one of the endgame possibilities in Whiskerwood. But keeping those tabby tyrants happy has benefits in the shape of new building blueprints and other resources, while also decreasing the likelihood of royal warships showing up to whip your population into submission. You can also turn in partial tax shipments, but you won't earn any blueprints from these, and you'll lose a point or two of moggy approval each time.
</p><p>
I think Whiskerwood could be very good. It's familiar in many ways, but the faintly satirical cat-and-mouse premise puts a different spin on the business of extracting resources, keeping workers happy, and expanding or upgrading your dominions. It's also pretty intricate. All your mice have traits like Slow or Patient or Good Teacher, which affect how willing they are to, for example, work emergency shifts, or sleep outside at night. They have guild specialisms and accompanying strengths and weaknesses - there's a guild of heavy-duty manual labourers who can carry more stuff but also need more food. 
</p>
<p>
There are questions of terrain to consider when setting up farms and foraging stations: certain crops favour higher altitudes, others want to grow underground. You've got to think about keeping your squeakers warm during the winter, and supplying them with fine clothes and other luxuries once you've dealt with basic needs. Lots to pick at, indeed - and later on, there's the prospect of Whiskerwood going full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> once you've unlocked relevant technologies. If you think my island looks dystopian right now, just wait till I've deluged it in conveyor belt spaghetti and started hollowing out mountains for storage. We'll make a Dunwall out of this place yet.</p>
<p>If I have a broad criticism, it's that I'm not sure the game's anthropomorphic take on colonisation includes any equivalents for indigenous people. Based on the little I've played, it's all about pioneers wrangling with their masters overseas, operating across a species split that is probably more of a metaphor for social class than race or ethnicity. The islands appear devoid of life besides plants before you arrive. If this is to be an allegory, I'd like the game to think harder about the fantasy of unspoilt, "virgin soil".
</p>
<p>
Again, Whiskerwood is out in early access today. It'll stay there "for a year, but that could change depending on how the design develops with player feedback," according to Minakata Dynamics. Everything mentioned on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">the Steam page</a> is apparently in the game now, but the 1.0 release "will include additional quests, more goods and production chains, additional tech tree options, additional buildings, and additional mechanics pertaining to rebellion, combat, and the sea." I'm tempted to conclude with another upbeat mouse pun, but I don't want to sound cheesy.

<p>Battlefield 6’s lead producer has revealed how bots work in the game. </p>



<p>Bots in Battlefield 6 have been a subject of conversation since the open beta days, with some players annoyed about the frequency of bots and others happy to have some non-sweaty lobbies. The title also added a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough mode</a> recently, which adds 32 bots in each match. Now the developers have revealed how BF6 bots actually work. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-only-appear-for-these-reasons">Battlefield 6 Bots ‘Only’ Appear for These Reasons</h2>



<p>The lead producer for Battlefield 6, David Sirland, revealed what criteria need to be met for bots to enter and leave lobbies. Sirland’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) was a lengthy thread intended to clarify the confusion surrounding bots in BF6. The lead producer revealed that bots will enter regular playlists “only under these conditions: players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)”. When that happens, bots will enter to “fill the server to the necessary limit.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bots enter the game on regular playlists ONLY under these conditions: <br>– players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)<br>At that point, the bots fill the server to the necessary limit to start the game</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland adds that there should be 24 players per side, he believes, for “CQ for ex”. This allows players to battle against bots instead of waiting in line. While they are playing, “other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist – will join this server (as it has you on it).” Whenever a new player joins the lobby, a bot will leave, and when the lobby is filled with 24 players, it will no longer be seeded with bots. The rest of the slots are left for other players as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-alternative-for-bots-in-battlefield-6-is-waiting-possibly-forever">The Alternative for Bots in Battlefield 6 is Waiting “Possibly Forever” </h2>



<p>If the developers do not use this Battlefield 6 bots system, the other alternative is “full on waiting (possibly forever)” to play on your preferred playlists in regions with low populations to fill a server. Moreover, players need to stay with the bots for the server to fill with regular players.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The alternative to doing this, would be full on waiting (possibly forever) to play on the playlist of your choice in regions with low population. <br>but to fill a server (the first in the region) – you need to stay with the bots. <br>if you keep leaving because: 1: you see bots</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036848511398177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland concluded, stating that they can and will “can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in” for Battlefield 6. Lastly, there are also “onboarding bots” which are used in specific game modes for new players. However, these are different from seeded bots as they “stick around and populate a big chunk of the total players on each team.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s most frustrating challenges <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-frustrating-challenges-fixed-or-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been fixed or greatly reduced</a>. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies across all platforms</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Playing NBA 2K26 might be a way for some NBA players to unwind, but Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell utilized the game another way. The six-time All-Star was motivated to put up 46 points on November 5 after he said "this kid pissed me off" while playing the basketball game online earlier in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with 46 points, Mitchell had eight assists and four rebounds against the Philadelphia 76ers. When asked about the performance, he noted taking inspiration from an online multiplayer encounter in NBA 2K26, according to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavaliers-donovan-mitchell-motivation-video-game-heckler-46-point-night/">CBS Sports</a>. "This kid pissed me off today, I was playing 2K," said Mitchell.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had been playing 2K for like two hours and I told him, too, I said, 'Just wait.' He called me washed up, he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn't seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, 'Alright, we'll see.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Mitchell ended the story by stating that his 46-point performance "was for that kid or grown man" and that he appreciates "whoever that was" in the video game.

                <p>Square Enix unveiled a bold strategy that could have far-reaching implications for the games industry, as the Japanese publisher aims to use generative AI to automate 70% of game QA and debugging by 2027.</p><p>After releasing its financial results, Square Enix also revealed <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a progress report</a> on the company's medium-term business plan. On page five of the 20-page presentation, Square Enix announced a partnership with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo to research ways of "improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies."</p><p>Titled "Joint Development of Game QA Automation Technology Using Generative AI," the project features a research team of more than 10 members from both the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory and Square Enix. The goal is to "automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027" by using automation technology to improve QA efficiency and operations. Through this R&amp;D, Square Enix hopes to "establish a competitive advantage in game development."</p><p>AI has become a hotly contested topic in games and beyond. Many developers and publishers have mixed opinions on the technology, with some saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">it should be embraced</a> and others claiming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">it poses legal risks</a>. It's not used everywhere; Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-devs-claim-theres-no-genai-in-game-after-publishers-ai-first-shift/1100-6535799/" data-ref-id="1100-6535799">won't use generative AI</a> despite its publisher, Krafton Inc., <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">going all in on the technology</a>. However, it's still being pushed onto developers, with EA wanting its employees to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">think of AI as a "thought partner"</a> while training it on their work.</p>

Series X|S and PC, but that's not all. Microsoft is bringing the game to PlayStation for the first time, and fans on Sony's system don't have to wait. Halo: Campaign Evolved will debut day and date on PS5 with the other versions in 2026. There were rumors and rumbling of Halo on Switch 2, but Microsoft has not yet made any announcements about that.</p><h2 id="Game_Pass">Game Pass</h2><p>Like all of Microsoft's other first-party games, Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch into Xbox Game Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_guns_and_prequel_missions"><strong>New guns and prequel missions</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There are nine new weapons coming to the Halo: CE remake, including the energy sword, which was equipped by enemies in the original version but couldn't be used by the player. As for the new missions, these are prequel missions featuring Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson in a "brand-new arc" that takes place before the events of the story you already know.</p><p dir="ltr">Another significant update is that players can hijack enemy vehicles and drive the Wraith--this was not possible in the original version of the game, and was introduced in Halo 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also look forward to a "campaign remix" feature that allows players to take on any missions they want with a series of modifiers, or Skulls, to alter the experience with things like random weapons and enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">On the social side, the Halo: CE remake includes two-player split-screen co-op on console (not available on PC) or four-player online co-op. There is cross-play support and shared progressions between console and PC.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4597945" data-ratio="0.5607476635514" data-width="1177" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4597945"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at Halo: Campaign Evolved's new visuals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Sprint"><strong>Sprint</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In what may be a controversial change, the Halo: CE remake includes sprinting, which is something the early Halo games did not have. The lack of sprint is a defining feature of the older Halo games and something that players feel fondly for. Others, however, may be excited about sprinting and bringing the game up to modern standards. Sprint can be disabled if players want to do that.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="_Reborn__visuals"><strong>"Reborn" visuals</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is promising a suite of updates and upgrades to the classic game. The company claims <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-1-remake-has-every-asset-getting-attention/1100-6535744/" data-ref-id="1100-6535744">"every asset"</a> from the original was improved upon for the remake.</p><p dir="ltr">"Battle through the original missions, newly rebuilt with enhanced level design, updated cinematics, and improved wayfinding, refined to keep the pace moving without losing the wonder, tension, or heroism of the original," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios promises that the game’s environments have been "reborn with all-new visuals, cinematics, and animations." The soundtrack, too, has been remastered, with Halo Studios promising "greater immersion." The primary cast, presumably including Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana) is back, and they recorded new lines for the remake.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Unreal_Engine_5"><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong></h2><p>After building Halo: Infinite with a proprietary engine called Slipspace, the developers at Halo Studios shifted to Unreal Engine 5 for future Halo titles, including Halo: Campaign Evolved. This was largely seen as a positive, as the old engine had legacy code that was said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-could-be-making-the-jump-from-slipspace-to-unreal-engine-report/1100-6507973/" data-ref-id="1100-6507973">added more complexity for developers</a>. Switching to Unreal Engine 5 was also seen as a positive for recruitment, as Epic's engine is one of the most widely used in the video game industry.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_everyone_likes_the_changes"><strong>Not everyone likes the changes</strong></h2><p>While Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto is a big believer in the Halo: Campaign Evolved package and said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">the game warms his heart</a>, another original developer has some reservations. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Jaime Griesemer blasted some of the changes.</a></p><p>Griesemer lamented the trailer's sequence where the Warthog vehicle moved past obstacles that were placed in its path to prevent players from being able "to steamroll the Hunters." "When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters," Griesemer said. "But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame."</p><h2 id="AI_">AI?</h2><p>Microsoft is investing heavily in artificial intelligence technologies and systems, so many wondered if the company used AI or generative AI on Halo: Campaign Evolved. The company has neither confirmed nor denied this, but said its staffers were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-wasnt-forced-to-use-generative-ai/1100-6535730/" data-ref-id="1100-6535730">not <em>required</em> to use genAI for Halo: Campaign Evolved.</a></p><p>"There is no mandate to use generative AI in our game development, and that includes Halo: Campaign Evolved," Microsoft said.</p><p>Executive producer Damon Conn and Game director Greg Hermann spoke about the development of Halo: Campaign Evolved. When asked whether Halo Studios used AI in any capacity, whether that be retouching assets or rebuilding environments, Conn explained that AI can streamline workflows, but people create the games.</p><p>"I want to be very clear … People are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows. It can do things for the game," Conn said. "But I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and there’s an opportunity to improve a workflow, or something along those lines, we’ll look at it again. It really should be additive to the creation of a game."</p><p>Hermann echoed Conn's sentiment, saying that, like other tools developers use when making games--such as Photoshop or Unity--AI is simply the same thing. It's the brush that helps the artist paint. It can aid in the execution, but it's people who hold the creative spark.</p><p>"It's a tool in a toolbox," Hermann said. "I may go a little off message here, but some of that gets very challenging when we look at how integrated AI is becoming within our tooling. We use Photoshop. There's generative fill, for example. The boundary lines can get a little fuzzy. I will say, though, again, to Damon's point, it really is about that creative spark that comes from people and improving just overall workflows."</p><h2 id="No_multiplayer">No multiplayer</h2><p>As stated, Halo: Campaign Evolved has no multiplayer support beyond the online and local co-op for the campaign. There is no head-to-head multiplayer. If players want that, they can boot up Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which includes multiplayer support for a range of titles, including Halo: Combat Evolved. The game is not available on PlayStation, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_the_first_remake_and_maybe_not_the_last"><strong>Not the first remake and maybe not the last</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Microsoft released a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved back in 2011 Xbox 360 via Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.

That game, released in 2021, was not the success that Microsoft envisioned, and developer Halo Studios underwent a major reorganization after it released.</p>

		<p>Dead By Daylight’s 2v8 mode is back for a limited time and it will feature two iconic franchises. The Silent Hill x Castlevania crossover will see Pyramid Head and Dracula team up to hunt down the survivors. As mentioned this is going to be a limited time run, starting today and ending on November 20th. You can see the character designs in the trailer below.</p>

<p>This is the fifth time the 2v8 mode has been added to Dead By Daylight, with previous entries featuring characters from the likes of Resident Evil, Scream’s Ghost Face, and The Oni. Dead By Daylight is still one of Behaviour Interactive’s main focuses having cancelled Project T last year, but the team is also working on publishing Blight: Survival, which is being developed by Haenir Studio. Blight: Survival is a PvE survival game set in the medieval era where players face off against monsters and men. A small teaser for that was released last week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Kiborg developer Sobaka Studios is switching genres with its next game, moving from a roguelite beat ’em up to a party game that stars chickens. Chicken Chicken will see up to eight players compete against each other online in a variety of challenges to come out on top. A demo is being released today on Steam and Epic Game Store, which will have three of the events players will face off against each other in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chiken Chiken - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJ9yOX1mDi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We come from a background of dark, violent action games like&nbsp;KIBORG, so&nbsp;Chicken Chicken&nbsp;might seem a bit unusual,”</em> said Dmitry Kachkov, Head of Sobaka Studio. <em>“But when you feel the pain of reaching the top of the mountain in Climbing Up…and someone hits you with a rocket launcher and sends you all the way to the bottom, you will understand.”</em></p>
<p>The list of the events available in the Chicken Chicken demo are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cars – players will race against each other to collect seed bags and deliver them to a giant chicken at the top of a mountain.</li>
<li>Climbing Up – players are tasked with climbing up a mountain made of old buildings while evading cannons dotted around the map, and rockets from the launchers other players can pick up.</li>
<li>Swamp – the one team game in this demo where two teams are tethered to a giant chicken and attempt to catch flies. Breaking the tether or falling into the swamp are two issues that need to be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chicken Chicken is due to release in 2026. In our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/kiborg-review/">Kiborg</a>, Adrian wrote, <em>“Too much of my time with Kiborg was spent thinking how much more fun I’d be having if the game dumped the roguelite elements and just went full old-school third person action brawler. So many of its failings could be ignored in that form. Instead, Kiborg is a slightly underwhelming rougelite that looks like it should be far more fun that it is.”</em></p>

<p>This will go down well</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="97803bc08af8a"><a title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/97803bc08af8a/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has laid out plans to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks with generative AI by 2027.</p>
<p>This comes via a progress report on the company's <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">'Square Enix Reboots and Awakens'</a> business plan (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">VGC</a>) in which it hopes to turn its fortunes around and become a true industry leader. It states that it has initiated a partnership with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at "improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies"</p>
<p>So as part of this, Square Enix is looking to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks with generative AI, with hopes to "improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development".</p>
<p>The partnership is currently comprised of "researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory UTokyo, and engineers from the SQUARE ENIX group", resulting in a team of over ten members.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e4397d300ab87"><a title="SE Report" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4397d300ab87/se-report.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, this decision will likely be met with mixed reception from fans. On the one hand, QA is said to be a tedious task, but ultimately utilising more and more AI is just going to result in more job losses. And who knows just how accurate AI will prove to be when diagnosing issues? It's a tricky one.</p>
<p>Square Enix's announcement comes just after EA launched a new partnership with Stability AI to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p>
<p>EA had presumably predicted the negative response to this announcement, and stressed that human creators will still be the driving force at the company, stating that AI "can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream".</p>

Some of these monsters are getting Mega Evolutions, and we already know Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur will definitely be getting these powerful transformations next month. And because these three were confirmed in today’s trailer, we also probably know all the others that will be added thanks to fans datamining the game.</span></p>  <p><span>The supposed list of new Megas that began circulating last month included Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur, so it stands to reason that it’s at least a partial view of what new Mega forms will debut in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. Notably, some Pokémon who already have Mega Evolutions in the base game are supposedly getting a second Mega Evolution that fans are calling “Z” forms, but it’s unclear at the moment what they’ll actually be called in-game. The full list reads as follows:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu X</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu Y</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Chimecho</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Absol</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Staraptor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Garchomp</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Lucario</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golurk</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Meowstic</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Crabominable</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golisopod</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Magearna</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Scovillain</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Glimmora</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tatsugiri</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baxcalibur</span></li> </ul> <p><span>I’m not holding my breath, but it would be cool if there were even more Mega Evolutions that we don’t know about. Corviknight, the armored bird from the Galar region, is shown in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>trailer, and one of my favorites, so I would love it if he got a surprise Mega form as well. I can’t get too greedy, though. Raichu is finally getting a Mega Evolution after a decade of disrespect, so I should probably just shut the fuck up.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>appears to take place in the post-game, so you will likely have to beat the main story before you can play it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NetEase is shutting down yet another studio that was working on a game that, likely, won’t see a release. In a post on social media, studio head Sean Crooks announced that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors on November 17 after the parent company pulled funding. </p>



<p>That just so happens to be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-is-closing-one-of-its-studios-after-just-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same day as another NetEase studio</a>, Fantastic Pixel Castle, will be closed.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Crooks said that the closure comes despite “best efforts” to find a new partner for the studio and its game.</p>



<div><p><strong>“Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft,”</strong> he said. <strong>“What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</strong></p><p><strong>“The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.”</strong></p></div>



<p>Bad Brain Game Studios was formed in May 2023 with Crooks, who was a producer on games like Watch Dogs: Legion, at the helm. The studio has been working on a game known as Midnight Riders, which was set to be open world action-adventure game with a 1980’s aesthetic. You can check out the game’s sizzle reel below, courtesy of Crooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>An Update on Bad Brain Game Studios</p><p>It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors. Our last official day of operation will be on November 17th.</p><p>Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</p><p>The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.</p><p>As we close this chapter,&nbsp;the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</p><p>To help support our people as they take their next steps, we’ll also be releasing a sizzle reel from the project publicly, giving everyone the chance to showcase their incredible work and open doors to new opportunities.</p><p>If you’re looking for world-class developers, artists, and storytellers, please reach out — we would be proud to connect you with them.</p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude once again to everyone who supported us along the way. Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.</p><p>Sean Crooks<br>Studio Head</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wouldn’t it be cool if BLANK met BLANK?” is a question fans have asked each other for a long time, and occasionally we get an actual, official answer. Whether it be two different rival comic book companies<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dcs-batmandeadpool-1-to-feature-crossovers-between-nightwing-and-wolverine-harley-quinn-and-hulk-and-more"><u> joining forces for a big crossover</u></a>, a hodgepodge of<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-mortal-kombat-1-the-t-1000-has-a-skeleton-intestines-a-heart-and-a-soul"><u> outside IP inclusions in a fighting game</u></a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/freddy-vs-jason"><u>two slasher icons finally facing off</u></a> thanks to the rights to one of them swapping studios, we’ve seen some notable events of this sort through the years. Then the MCU caused an explosion in the idea of a shared movie universe akin to what comic books have long offered, with the likes of the Conjuring Universe, the DCEU (and now the DCU), and more exploring a larger world that allows for characters and concepts to freely interact with each other across multiple projects. Still, Alien and Predator deserve credit for being early to this idea, even as their own exploration of the concept has ebbed and flowed a <em>lot</em> through the decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the new film <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-badlands"><u>Predator: Badlands</u></a> is getting attention for its prominent use of Weyland-Yutani, the organization that has been a major part of the Alien franchise since the start. Yet this is hardly the first time Alien and Predator have bled over…and sometimes bled <em>on</em>…each other, with a history that includes everything from fun easter eggs to outright direct crossovers across multiple media. So let’s look back at the history of these two franchises intersecting, and the long road to the idea becoming officially integrated into the core canon films.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>It’s All Thanks to Comic Books</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator"><u>first Predator movie</u></a> came out in 1987, eight years after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/alien/Movie_-_Alien_(1979)"><u>original Alien</u></a>. A big hit in its own right, Predator’s timing was also notable, coming out just a year removed from the major success of 1986’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/alien/Movie_-_Aliens_(1986)"><u>Aliens</u></a>, the first Alien sequel. There were some innate, albeit basic, similarities in the films, beginning on the corporate side. Both movies were owned and released by 20th Century Fox, something that would prove to be key to allowing crossovers without the legal hurdles that can often curtail such a thing. But more than that, both films were about a visually distinctive and notably dangerous alien creature fighting humans, and while the Alien movies were set in the future and Predator in the present, there was no reason to think either species hadn’t been around and would continue to be around for a long time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1988, Dark Horse Comics began publishing Aliens-branded comic books, and it was a quick success, proving the appeal to that title beyond the films. Both 20th Century Fox and Dark Horse were clearly pleased with the results; in 1989, Dark Horse put out their first licensed Predator comic book limited series as well. Then, well, it’s actually quite impressive how quickly the two were pitted against each other, especially when you consider how new Predator was as a title at all. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There was no reason to think either species hadn’t been around and would continue to be around for a long time.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Horse’s Chris Warner is credited with being the one to first suggest bringing the two extraterrestrial threats up against each other in comic book form, telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180801221308/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-creator-of-alien-vs-predator-looks-back-on-his-classic-and-his-new-predator-books" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Syfy Wire</u></a> in 2018, “It’s a pretty obvious idea. When you say, ‘Ali vs. Frazier, King Kong vs. Godzilla, Aliens vs. Predator,’ the ideas just exploded. You hear the adage, ‘It almost wrote itself.' Well, it almost wrote itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As 1989 came to a close, a three-part storyline was launched in the black-and-white anthology series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics/dark-horse-presents-vol-1"><u>Dark Horse Presents</u></a>, except its true interconnected nature was saved for the end. In Dark Horse Presents #34, readers got an Aliens story, and then in issue #35, a Predator story. But then came Dark Horse Presents #36, with a cover that read “Aliens vs. Predator” among the list of that issue's stories and accompanying art showing one of each species in battle. And just like that, a major sub-franchise/spin-off connected to two other established franchises was born. </p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/dark-horse-presents-36-alien-predator-1762384103917.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The cover of Dark Horse Presents #36 (Feb. 1990)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That first Dark Horse Presents story was in fact a lead-in to a full<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/alien/Comic_-_Aliens_vs._Predator_(1989)"><u> Aliens vs. Predator five-issue limited series</u></a>, which launched in the summer of 1990. Some of the core elements of this comic, including the Predators hunting xenomorphs as a rite of passage, and a partnership forming between the intelligent Predators and a human (in this case, Machiko Noguchi, a colonist on the planet Ryushi) against the insect-like, monstrous Aliens, would be explored further and echoed in many other stories that followed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That first limited series was a hit, and from then on, AVP (as it quickly became commonly referred to) was a go-to concept for Dark Horse, even as they continued to publish independent Aliens and Predator comics. For nearly 30 years, until the rights to both properties would change hands after Disney bought 20th Century Fox, and subsequent Alien and Predator comics would move to Marvel, Dark Horse would revisit Aliens vs. Predator in various limited series, one-shots, and short stories. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The First Movie Connection </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When the initial Aliens vs. Predator limited series launched in 1990, it was a big year for Predator in general. Just as that comic series was wrapping up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-2"><u>Predator 2</u></a> hit theaters, and with it came the arrival of arguably one of the biggest and most tantalizing easter eggs in franchise movie history up to that point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Predator 2’s conclusion, LA cop Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) follows the Predator he’s been battling onto its ship, and comes across a trophy wall which is covered in skulls from previous successful Predator hunts. Some of these skulls are human, but many are from various alien species which were created just for Predator 2…except, most notably, a large freaking ALIEN skull that is very clearly in the shape of a xenomorph. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/image2-1762376255375.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A glimpse of a xenomorph skull in the climactic sequence from Predator 2 (1990)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who is old enough to remember, I can tell you that even in a pre-Internet era, seeing this huge connection between the two franchises actually appearing in a movie was a big deal, and immediately had many fans hyped for the implications and potential. For those of us who had been reading the Aliens vs. Predator comic especially, this seemed like a huge signal that a movie version was imminent, and how cool would <em>that</em> be!? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, those involved have said there were no real conversations about making an Aliens vs. Predator movie at the time, and that the easter egg was intended as simply a fun reference, not a promise of anything to come. Moreso, they downplayed the AVP comic book as an influence, saying it was more of an in-joke over the fact that legendary special effects makeup creator Stan Winston had worked on both Alien and Predator films. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that didn’t stop fans from speculating about the possibilities, that’s for sure… </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Read All About It</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the 1990s, Dark Horse kept publishing Aliens vs. Predator comics, with the concept eventually expanding into books as well. In 1994, the novel Aliens vs. Predator: Prey was published, featuring an adaptation of the first AVP comic book limited series. Besides its subtitle, foreshadowing a title eventually used for a Predator film, this book also stands out as the source for the name “Yautja” for the Predator species, something that would remain true in all Predator media since then and later find its way into the films. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two more AVP novels – Aliens vs. Predator: Hunter's Planet and Aliens vs. Predator: War – would shortly follow to form a connected trilogy with the first book. After that, things stayed quiet on the AVP book front until 2016’s Alien vs. Predator: Armageddon. This book took a page from the original Dark Horse Presents AVP story by serving as the concluding chapter to two earlier novels – Predator: Incursion and Alien: Invasion – that had been released with only Alien or Predator branding, though they told one complete story. More recently, 2022 saw the release of two AVP books – an anthology titled Aliens vs. Predators: Ultimate Prey, and the standalone story, Aliens vs. Predators: Rift War. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Games Aplenty</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if there was nothing being planned for the movies just yet, 20th Century Fox clearly saw that the Aliens vs. Predator concept could have a life beyond the printed page. Shortly before the first AVP book was released, the concept also made its first leap into video games with 1993’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-snes"><u>Alien vs. Predator for the SNES</u></a>, which was a side-scrolling beat-'em-up where you play as a Predator taking on one xenomorph after another. That same year saw a Game Boy release as well, Alien vs. Predator: The Last of His Clan. This was then followed by a different game, also just called<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-arcade"><u> Alien vs. Predator, for arcades</u></a> in 1994, which had four selectable characters to choose from, including two different Predators and two human cyborgs…one of whom was Arnold Schwarzenegger's character Dutch from the first Predator movie! While none of these games are identical in setting or story, they do share the same basic side-scrolling approach to Alien fighting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That would change with another 1994 release, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-jaguar"><u>Alien vs. Predator game for the Atari Jaguar</u></a>. This game was AVP’s introduction to the realm of first-person shooters and also had players changing perspectives between humans (in the form of Colonial Marines, as introduced in Aliens), Predators, and even xenomorphs depending on the level. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This quick glut of AVP games would then lead to some time off before the concept was revisited in 1999 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-versus-predator"><u>Aliens Versus Predator PC game</u></a>, which told its own story while heavily echoing the Jaguar game’s approach via another FPS where you play as an Alien, Predator, or Colonial Marine at various stages. This was followed by a 2002 sequel, the cleverly titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-versus-predator-2"><u>Aliens Versus Predator 2</u></a>, while the Alien/Predator/Colonial Marine approach would be used yet <em>again</em> in 2003’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-vs-predator-extinction"><u>PS2 and Xbox release, Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction</u></a>, though Extinction was instead a real-time strategy game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the AVP movies were released in the mid-aughts (more on those in a moment), some forgettable tie-in games came out as well, including an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-mobile"><u>Alien vs. Predator mobile game</u></a> in 2004 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-vs-predator-requiem"><u>PlayStation Portable’s Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem</u></a> in 2007. And though the decidedly poor reaction to the Requiem movie put an end to the AVP movies (for now?), the concept would still result in a couple more self-contained games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another FPS featuring – you guessed it – Aliens, Predators, and Colonial Marines as playable characters, the 2010 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-vs-predator-2010"><u>Aliens vs. Predator game for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360</u></a> stands as the most recent full AVP game released for any system, with the exception of 2013’s poorly received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avp-evolution"><u>AVP: Evolution</u></a> mobile game. At this point, it’s now been 12 years since the last Alien vs. Predator game, which is the longest gap since they began making AVP games in 1993. somehow, though, I would bet we’ll get another one at <em>some</em> point. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Those Actual AVP Movies</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With no individual Alien or Predator film being made at the time, 2004 saw that Predator 2 tease finally get paid off on a movie screen, as 20th Century Fox released<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien-vs-predator"><u> Alien vs. Predator</u></a> in theaters. And man was it…not worth the wait. Yes, sadly, the first AVP movie was a poorly constructed letdown with weak characters and unmemorable action. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first live-action Alien-connected story to be set in the present day, the film did lean into some established Alien lore by including the character Charles Bishop Weyland. Played by Lance Henriksen, he was a bit of a double reference, since Charles is the founder of Weyland Industries – obviously meant to be the precursor to Alien’s powerful and usually antagonistic corporation, Weyland-Yutani – while his middle name, and the casting of Henriksen, indicated that he was the physical template for Henriksen’s earlier character, the synthetic Bishop in 1986’s Aliens. There were also some echoes of that first Aliens vs. Predator comic, given the story eventually involves a human female protagonist (here, Sanaa Lathan’s Lex) needing to team with a Predator against the mutual threat of the xenomorphs.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first AVP movie was a poorly constructed letdown with weak characters and unmemorable action.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first AVP movie made enough money to lead to a sequel in 2007, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, which didn’t include any returning human characters, but did continue the earlier film’s amusing set up of a “Predalien,” a xenomorph who had gestated within a Predator. Despite the film’s pre-release hype pushing its R rating (after the previous AVP was PG-13), Requiem was another muddled mess, delivering a poorly conceived, not to mention poorly lit, film that failed to capitalize on what people love about the two title characters. And so that was it for actually putting Aliens and Predators together in a movie, at least for the time being. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that imagery from the AVP movies was used as the basis for much of the Alien vs. Predator house that was part of Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights in 2014 (in both Orlando and Hollywood) and again in 2015 (Hollywood only). As weak as the AVP movies were, these were very cool and visually impressive houses, and something we’re not likely to see again. Now that Alien and Predator are owned by Disney, an HHN partnership isn’t going to happen again, not unless something major changes in terms of the adversarial theme park dynamic between Disney and Universal. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alien Vs. Predator maze at Universal Studio Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when the Alien vs. Predator movies first came out, it felt like some of the backstory for these two creatures would be difficult to match what the other Alien and Predator films had established. These days, like the comics, books, and games before them, both AVP movies are pretty much considered non-canon to the two separate central movie franchises that begat them…especially once Ridley Scott’s Alien prequel, Prometheus, established a different founder (Peter Weyland, played by Guy Pearce) for a slightly different company now named Weyland Corp. Once again, that Predator 2 xenomorph skull is the only actual core canon connection the two series have had with each other…until now.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Modern Resurgence</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Alien and Predator now in their Disney-owned 20th Century<em> Studios</em> era, both franchises have been successfully revived in recent years. In 2022, Dan Trachtenberg’s 18th century-set <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/prey-2022"><u>Prey </u></a>brought an exciting new flair to the Predator films, which he continued in his animated anthology, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-killer-of-killers"><u>Predator: Killer of Killers</u></a>, released this summer. Alien, meanwhile, returned to the big screen via 2024’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien-romulus"><u>Alien: Romulus</u></a>, while Fargo’s Noah Hawley brought xenomorphs to TV for the first time this year in the FX series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien-romulus"><u>Alien: Earth</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Romulus and Prey had zero connections to anything outside of their own respective realms, things are changing in a big way in 2025 with Predator: Badlands, which also brings the Predator series back to movie theaters after Prey and Killer of Killers were released on Hulu. In Badlands, one of the central characters – Elle Fanning’s Thia – is an android who teams with a Predator. But she’s not just <em>any</em> android; she’s a Weyland-Yutani synthetic, giving a very prominent role to a character directly connected to Alien lore. Other pre-release material has confirmed the film has plenty of Weyland-Yutani involvement, including a second synthetic played by Fanning, and an army made up of an identical male synthetic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trachtenberg told <a href="https://ew.com/comic-con-preview-movie-predator-badlands-11765860" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>EW</u></a> this all came about because he first had the idea for a Predator to team with a robot, "and then the next thought was, wait a minute, I know a company that makes robots. And that led to the Weyland-Yutani synth of it all.” Trying to keep expectations in check, he’s also stressed Badlands is a “toe-dip” crossover; don’t expect something more in terms of xenomorphs showing up for a full AVP detour. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, it’s hard not to speculate on what might come next for the two concepts. There remains the potential for another true showdown that hopefully can be accomplished in a more satisfying way than the two AVP movies. We now have both series moving forward on a regular basis – a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-romulus-director-fede-alvarez-will-produce-but-not-direct-the-sequel"><u>sequel to Alien: Romulus </u></a>is on the way – alongside this newfound development of an actual major canon connection between them. And sure, this comes after a lot of other shared universes have been seen in films in recent years, but giving credit where it’s due, the idea of Alien and Predator being connected was first set up literally decades ago. They deserve another chance!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predator: Badlands will be released in theaters on November 7, 2025. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-alien-connection-continues-a-crossover-concept-going-back-decades]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/repo/">REPO</a> has amassed an impressive following since its debut on February 26. Less than two weeks from launch, it hit over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/repo-has-come-out-of-nowhere-on-steam-topping-145000-concurrent-players/1100-6530038/" data-ref-id="1100-6530038">145,000 concurrent players</a>. Now, after the release of the Monster update on October 30, REPO is bigger than ever--and that includes its roster of enemies.</p><p>In the horror co-op game, you're tasked with the simple ordeal of picking up valuable items across quite eerie locations and bringing them back safely to the starting point. When you hit your quota, you're all set to move on. But the monsters lurking in the shadows ensure that you never get too confident.</p><p>If you've been looking for a place to learn more about all REPO monsters, including the 10 new additions of the Monster update, this guide has you covered with details about behaviors, danger levels, and exactly how fearsome each of them is.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597359-20251030231932_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597359" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597359-20251030231932_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597359"></a><figcaption>Gnomes are as annoying as they are dangerous.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597359-20251030231932_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Gnome">Gnome</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 20</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 10</li></ul><p>The gnome will usually be in packs, and will target you as a group.

Do this with force.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597354-20251030234534_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597354" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597354-20251030234534_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597354"></a><figcaption>Also, while a Spewer is latched onto your face, your in-game voice will get deeper.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597354-20251030234534_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Spewer">Spewer</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 65</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 10</li></ul><p>The Spewer excels at vomiting acid, which isn't great, but its secondary skill is worse, as it'll literally latch onto your face. When the latter happens, you'll randomly vomit anything and anyone in front of you. The best countermeasure is to try to dodge the monster's jumps and vomit, but you can also grab and throw them against a hard surface to deal damage. You may need two people to do this, however, depending on your current strength.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597350-20251031001350_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597350" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597350-20251031001350_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597350"></a><figcaption>This can't be good.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597350-20251031001350_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Bella">Bella</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 200</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 5</li></ul><p>There are very few things as terrifying as the sound of a tricycle when you're alone in a dark room.

When you're spotted, the Mentalist creates a gravity field of sorts, where you'll be subtly stunned. Once the field turns red, the monster will slam you toward the ground. If a teammate is nearby, the best course of action is to have them grab you and pull you outside the field. Killing them is tricky without weapons, so it's best to try and avoid becoming trapped inside the gravity field in the first place.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597367-20251030235244_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597367" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597367-20251030235244_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597367"></a><figcaption>Wind's howling.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597367-20251030235244_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Bowtie">Bowtie</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 200</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 5</li></ul><p>The Bowtie may seem charismatic at a distance, but you should be careful when encountering one.

This is done by coming into contact with a pink cloud of spores. If you're trapped in it, you'll receive damage in a series of quick hits that can be fatal. Try to avoid the spores, and if you have any teammates nearby, pray that they're quick to pull you out if you are unable to.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597371-20251031003307_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597371" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597371-20251031003307_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597371"></a><figcaption>Don't take a gamble with this one.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597371-20251031003307_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Gambit">Gambit</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 150</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: Has different effects depending on color</li></ul><p>Once the Gambit spots you, they'll try to grab you.

There are different effects here: Green grants you health, red reduces it, white restores it fully, and black reduces it to 1 HP. While not fatal, the situation will be ride, to say the least. If you see yellow, you'll get money instead. Try to use weapons if you have them to prevent the wheel from spinning.

The enemy appears in a group of three, and in essence, the skulls will prepare to explode upon detecting you. It takes around 15 seconds for the explosion to take place, which may or may not be enough time to run. The key here is to either run or be smart and throw them somewhere far. If you encounter large objects that can block the explosion, that's a sign of a good throwing spot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597381-20251030231608_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597381" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597381-20251030231608_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597381"></a><figcaption>Yes chef.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597381-20251030231608_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Chef">Chef</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 150</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 10</li></ul><p>The cute-looking frog is knife-savvy and won't think twice about using them when you're spotted.

Their behavior is the classic chase once you're detected, but rather than, say, pulling you in, the Animal charges directly against you. They're also likely to start moving in different directions afterward, which is a nuisance.

When you're detected, the Hidden will try to grab you to take you around the map. You'll need either a weapon or a ton of strength to take the monster down. If you're lucky and you spot them before they do, you can try to crouch underneath an item to stay undetected.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597360-repo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597360" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597360-repo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597360"></a><figcaption>The Headman is a big fan of jump scares.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597360-repo1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Headman">Headman</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 250</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 50</li></ul><p>The Headman is a floating head that usually roams around halls and rooms searching for their next target.

Sadly, hiding underneath an object isn't an option, as they'll use the skull on one of their tentacles to attack you.

The best way to avoid them is to make a run for it while avoiding direct eye contact, as the latter will empower them and make them faster. Unless you have a ton of strength or, better yet, a weapon, the best course of action is to simply run away.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597378-20251030234328_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597378" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597378-20251030234328_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597378"></a><figcaption>The Huntsman's behavior is quite distinct compared to the rest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597378-20251030234328_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Huntsman">Huntsman</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 250</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 100</li></ul><p>The Huntsman is unable to see, which means they will try to pick up sounds instead.

If you see floating hands on each side of your screen, it means the Loom is nearby, and you're now their target. From that moment on, they'll start a slow chase. If you've seen the movie It Follows, you know what to do--keep on moving until you're face. Of course, there's a chance that they'll start chasing you again. If caught, they'll clap their hands with you in the center of them.</p><p>Those are all the monsters available in REPO thus far. Best of luck meeting your quota!</p>

            <p>Things are moving forward with the live-action Legend of Zelda film, which has now started production.</p>
<p>That's according to a listing on the <a href="https://productionlist.com/">Film &amp; Television Industry Alliance</a> website, which states filming for Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation would begin on 4th November 2025 - so, two days ago - and run until April next year.</p>

<p>If this is accurate, this should mean we could hear more casting news in the near future. This in turn will allow us to piece together which of the games in the Zelda series the film team is adapting. If Sidon pops up, we know we are in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> territory, for example. Perhaps we will get some kind of teaser for the series' 40th anniversary, which is early next year.</p>
<p>According to the website, filming for the Legend of Zelda film is taking place in Wellington, New Zealand. This is a popular filming location, with the likes of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films all heading to Wellington for some cinematic shots. Wellington's Kaitoke Regional Park, for example, became Rivendell. Wētā Workshop is also based in Wellington. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Legend of Zelda project summary reads thus: "A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise. 'The Legend of Zelda' follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness. The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce - an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Princess Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a> in the upcoming adaptation, which is currently set for a release in 2027.</p>

<p>As for the here and now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-more-switch-2-games-nintendo-just-reconfirmed-release-dates-for-five-big-releases-with-four-more-down-the-pipe">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is newly available on Switch 2</a>. Set before the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, this is a Legend of Zelda crossover with Koei Tecmo's Warriors franchise.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex has already had a shot with Age of Imprisonment</a>, calling it Warriors' "richest offering yet".</p>

            <p>
As part to today's big Pokémon blow-out, Nintendo has confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>'s Mega Dimension DLC is launching for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> on 10th December. Additionally, a new side-mission is available today.
</p>
<p>
We knew Mega Dimension was coming even before Z-A's release, and Nintendo's even talked about it fairly extensively too. But the gist is it adds a bunch of newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose. How? The answer, apparently, is "hyperspace".
</p>
<p>
For whatever reason, spatial distortions are beginning to form around the city, creating a sort of alternate plane of reality known as Hyperspce Lumiose. Here, players go on an adventure guided by doughnut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, that'll introduce them to those aforementioned new Pokémon and mega-evolutions - some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.

<p>
"Hoopa's powers are awakened when it receives one of Ansha's donuts," Nintendo explains in its release date announcement, "transforming the distortions into portals to hyperspace. Ansha uses Berries to create various kinds of donuts that grant different effects in hyperspace, such as powering up your Pokémon. She can also use more potent Hyperspace Berries, which are useful for taking on the high-level Pokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose."
</p>

<p>
And if you're wondering which Pokémon are getting new Mega-Evolved forms as part of Z-A's DLC, both Mega Chimecho and Mega Baxcalibur are now confirmed. The former can make six smaller copies of itself - and their overlapping, resonating echoes create an "intense sound-wave attack that can overwhelm any opponent". Baxcalibur's Mega Evolution, meanwhile, sees them generating a massive back blade out of ice energy, which can cleave or smash nearly anything in its path. The Mega Stone needed to evolve Baxcalibur is acquired through the Z-A Battle Club by advancing in online Ranked Battles. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell previously did a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-closest-thing-well-ever-get-to-the-mysterious-long-forgotten-gorochu-is-coming-to-pokemon-legends-z-a-but-youll-need-the-paid-dlc">pretty deep dive on some of the other additions coming to Mega Dimension</a> if you're curious to learn more.
</p><p>
It's potentially exciting stuff, then, but it's certainly not cheap. <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/pokemon-legends-z-a-70010000094235">Pokémon Legends: Z-A's Mega Dimension costs £24.99</a> - half of cost of the base Switch 1 game - over on eShop. And speaking of the base game, players can claim a Diancite Stone through the Mystery Gift feature from today. By taking the stone to the Looker Bureau, it's possible to unlock the new 'Shine Bright like a Gemstone' side mission, and a chance to catch the Jewel Pokémon Diancie.

<p>Get your very own Diancie</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>While today's headline news might be the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC getting a release date, there's another neat announcement tucked in all of the Mega madness.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a brand new Mystery Gift event, which is available in-game now in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Accessing this will unlock a brand new Side Mission in-game — <strong>Shine Bright like a Gemstone</strong> — which will reward you with your very own Diancie and Diancite, a Mega Stone that unlocks a brand new Mega Evolution for the Rock/Fairy-type.</p>
<p>All you need to do to access this gift is roll credits. You don't need to buy the DLC either! Easy, right? And from the looks of things, the event will be live... forever? No end date has been revealed, at least, so you've got time!</p>

<p>Diancie was introduced in Generation VI, first appearing in Pokémon X &amp; Y as part of a special event. It's a Mythical Pokémon, and pretty powerful as a result.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate, the 2D-action platformer from developer Bitmap Bureau Ltd. and publisher Reef Entertainment, has been delayed for a third time, though thankfully, players who've been anticipating this old-school take on Terminator will still be able to play it on PC and console platforms before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>It was initially set to arrive on September 5, 2025, though ahead of that launch, it was pushed to October. After that, it was pushed to November 26, 2025, and twenty days ahead of that release date, it was pushed again to its current, and hopefully final release date, December 12, 2025.</p>



<p>"<em>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you</em>," publisher Reef Entertainment began <a href="https://x.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the third (and hopefully final) delay for Terminator 2D: No Fate. "<em>We know you've waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey</em>."</p>



<p>This delay is, unfortunately, once again caused by issues Reef Entertainment has had with regard to the physical editions of the game. Before, the issue was tariff and trade-based, with the different components needed for the physical editions. Now that it has all that sorted, it needs to put the physical editions together.</p>



<p>"<em>The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions,</em> <em>which we need some time to do. Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: No Fate to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays. We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you. We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey.</p><p>The physical components for all editions have now…</p></div>— Reef Entertainment (@Reef_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate that players are left waiting a little longer, but delaying the game not for issues with the game itself, but for issues with the physical release, is commendable because it speaks to the publisher wanting everyone who is going to grab Terminator 2D: No Fate at launch, whether they're buying the physical edition or digital version, the same day-one experience. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>At least it's still arriving before the end of the year, and Termiantor fans will have something to play while they wait for Terminator: Survivors, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">still has no release date despite being given a 2025 release window in August 2024</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Square Enix Sales Fall After Quiet Six Months]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-sales-fall-after-quiet-six-months.1345624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales and profits are down, driven largely by a fairly quiet six-month period with very few major releases.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/26q2release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> outlining its latest financial results, Square Enix reveals that sales are down by 15% when compared to the same six-month period last year, while operating income has fallen by 28.8%.</p>

<p>The company puts this disparity down to new games generating "lower sales than releases such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam" rel="nofollow">three&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>catalog titles on Steam</a>...the previous year". Despite that, Square Enix says its video games business "returned to profitability" this year, largely thanks to expense-related technicalities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26.jpg?itok=Zda3A23j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26.jpg?itok=LSikqHw6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts</em>' Steam debut means the first six months of last year were better for Square Enix than this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix's MMORPG segment also declined, again largely due to the release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>last year. It might <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" rel="nofollow">not have offered the game's best story</a>, but it sure did boost Square Enix's business.</p>

<p>In fairness to Square Enix, it has been a pretty quiet six months for the publisher. In the six-month period ending on September 30th, Square Enix's catalog consists entirely of ports, including&nbsp;a Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Bravely Default&nbsp;</em>and the Xbox Series X|S release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>.</p>

<p>As we know,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m" rel="nofollow">wasn't exactly a major money-spinner</a> for Square Enix the first time around, so its arrival on a console that's struggling to keep up with its peers probably wasn't going to set the publisher's coffers alight.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, things look a touch rosier for Square Enix.&nbsp;Remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games arrived in late October, and that's a series that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-2024-25" rel="nofollow">tends to do pretty well</a> for the company. A remake of the seventh game in the series is also due to arrive in February.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NetEase Shuts Down Ex-Ubisoft Producer's Bad Brain Studios]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-shuts-down-ex-ubisoft-producers-bad-brain-studios.1345621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has closed down yet another of its studios before its first release, and this time, it's the turn of Bad Brain Game Studios, which was helmed by ex-Ubisoft producer Sean Crooks.</p>

<p>Announcing the shutdown on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Bad Brain, which was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">established back in 2023</a>, says that its last day of operation will be November 17th, and that while the studio is trying to find a new partner for its debut project, it has not yet managed to do so.</p>

<p>Bad Brain says that its game and the associated IP are both "still available for acquisition or partnership", and that the studio, as well as parent NetEase, is "open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=VAGB9xzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=k9ZNdMvt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Brain Game Studios was working on its debut project when it was shut down by NetEase.</figcaption></figure><p>To the end of helping former Bad Brain staffers find work, the studio also posted a sizzle reel of its in-development project alongside the LinkedIn post announcing its closure. The game, according to Bad Brain, was met with an "enthusiastic response" by peers and industry insiders.</p>

<p>From the looks of the sizzle reel,&nbsp;the untitled game would have been a third-person action-adventure game inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>and Rockstar's&nbsp;<em>Bully</em>, juxtaposing ordinary 80s life with delving into spooky locations to do battle with creepy-crawlies.</p>

<p>Bad Brain is the latest in a string of NetEase-backed studios to lose their funding or close down in recent months. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, which was founded by ex-BioWare vet Rich Vogel, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>, another ex-BioWare staffer's studio.</p>

<p>It's not just studios that haven't released games, either. In February, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down the development outfit</a> responsible for the hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so it seems that nobody is safe.</p>




<p>These shutdowns are taking place against the backdrop of an industry riven with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avalanche-studios-layoffs-uk-closure" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and there's no sign of the deluge ending anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>' first proper patch, assuming you're a member of the honourable sect who don't count <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/776434170343719695?l=english">hotfixes</a> as patches, has arrived. It's relatively small, but it does set up three new map conditions that'll be unleashed in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> this weekend, as well as fixing some pesky bugs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">notes</a>, the three new map conditions set to unlock this weekend are what looks to be a night raid variant of Blue Gate, as well as the more mysterious "hidden bunker" and "electromagnetic storm". Here's hoping the last two might be on the same map, given the former sounds like useful shelter from the latter.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it's bug fix city. The integrated shield recharger only recharging when it's equipped, Augment skills not working all, and health regen skills not working if activated while you're down but not out have all been dealt with. Perhaps the most fun mole that's been whacked is an exploit that was seeing deployables push players through walls.</p>
<p>Embark have also made zipline exit points barricade-free zones and ensured the Well-Travelled achievement triggers as planned. Finally, they've added both "a charge progress for integrated shield repair" and the punch hands pre-order bonus emote.</p>
<p>Edwin's been writing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-out-now-and-the-best-thing-about-it-so-far-is-bumsliding-through-a-buried-desert-city">bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-could-get-map-conditions-that-alter-the-friction-for-truly-tribes-esque-sliding">stuff</a> about Arc raiders and you can find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">our review</a> from Samuel Horti here.</p>
<p>"Arc Raiders wants to be one of your 'forever' games: it already has a roadmap for the rest of the year that includes a new map as well as new Arc enemies, items, and quests," reads the latter's verdict. "Its long-term strength will rely on the quality of those updates. I'm not yet deep enough to know whether Arc Raiders will feel this compelling at hour 100 or whether, in two months' time, I'll still be dreaming about it. For now, all I know is that its metallic hooks are in me, and I cannot stop playing."</p>
