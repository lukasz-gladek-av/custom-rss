			<p>It's been officially confirmed that the class <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-to-face-7-9-billion-mass-lawsuit-due-to-playstation-store-pricing/">lawsuit against Sony</a> in the UK is set to go to trial on 2 March 2026. It's estimated that the trial will last for eight weeks in total. For those unaware of what this trial is about, Sony is being sued for the unlawful behavior of charging out-of-proportion prices on their digital content, including add-ons. This lawsuit has been created by Alex Neill, a person with nearly 20 years' worth of experience in consumer campaigns and trying to achieve change for UK consumers. Alex is a regular speaker at industry events regarding consumer issues and consumer rights across all sectors in the UK. She is the sole director of Alex Neill Class Representative, which is a not-for-profit special purpose vehicle that is being used for the specific purpose of pursuing claims against Sony.</p>
<p>While the trial may seem far away, Alex explains that the trial dates have been set considering the amount of time it takes each of the parties to share evidence and expert reports and prepare their cases. The court's availability also plays a role.</p>
<p><a href="https://playstationyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This case</a> is based on the claim of those who owned a Sony PlayStation between 19 August 2016 and 19 August 2022 and those who did own one, purchased digital PlayStation games, or made in-game purchases via the PlayStation store. This class lawsuit is going ahead as the claimant believes that PlayStation is occupying a dominant position in relation to the digital distribution of PlayStation games and in-game content and, as such, has been charging UK customers too much for the content on their consoles. While Sony is entitled to make a profit with their products, the claimant is alleging that they are in breach of UK/EU competition law, as they have a "near monopoly" on the sale of digital games.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sony has enforced strict terms and conditions on game developers and publishers, which allows Sony to set the price of digital games and charge a 30% commission on every purchase of digital games and in-game content. This leads to excessive and unfair prices for consumers. By having such high prices, the Class is alleging that customers have been paying too much, which has led to detrimental effects for consumers, including stifling competition, where the competition has to charge higher prices even to get an opportunity to compete.</p>
<p>With this class lawsuit, anyone can sign up as long as they are eligible. If the Class is successful in its lawsuit, it means that those who signed up may receive some compensation from Sony.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/apocalypse-unleashed-marvel-crisis-protocol-figure-and-terrain-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>En Sabah Nur, known more commonly as Apocalypse, has finally made his chilling debut in <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>. As one of the most powerful and ancient mutants in Marvel Comics, Apocalypse has been a bane to the X-Men for decades. Now, <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em> players can bring this iconic villain to their tabletop battles. Atomic Mass Games sent along a review copy of Apocalypse, as well as several terrain sets tied to the character, for review - so follow along to hear my thoughts!</p>
<h2>Apocalypse Character Pack</h2>
<p>Let's start with the star of this show, Apocalypse. Also known as En Sabah Nur, he's been a long-time antagonist to the X-Men, with the goal of pushing the world to evolve through extreme crises! And though <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/collections/crisis-protocol/products/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Apocalypse character pack</a> is the second most expensive single-character pack for the game at USD $69.99 (second only to <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/collections/crisis-protocol/products/marvel-crisis-protocol-dormammu">the $79.95 Dormammu miniature</a>), there's a lot of content in this little box o' Apocalypse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-high-gloss-image.jpg?itok=AOMxjac- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-high-gloss-image.jpg?itok=_6NFJCX- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First, we should look at his stats and abilities, and I'll go over how I think he can best be used in a game of <em>MCP</em>. After that, I'll speak a bit to list creation with him, and how his specific list restrictions open up some really fun options for building a Four Horseman team!</p>
<p>First, his stats across the board are pretty strong - which you'd expect from one of Marvel's biggest baddies! With 4's in all his defense stats, and 7 HP, he's very sturdy. Add to that his special ability "Only The Strong Remain," which is always removing 1 Damage every time he's hurt, and you're looking at a very, very tough customer here. But here's another interesting aspect to this character: he's a size 4. That means that most things you throw at him (or throw him into) aren't going to hurt him much.</p>
<p>This, thematically, makes a lot of sense to me! It's hard to imagine Peter Parker doing much damage to Apocalypse by flinging a telephone pole at the guy, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For attacks, Apocalypse uses his ability to transform his body into weapons (the model kit comes with a few alternative build options for his arms, giving him saws or guns. I kept it classic, as I'm want to do in all my miniatures). This ability is shown in the Biomorphic Arsenal attack, his builder with a whopping 7 strength.</p>
<p>En Sabah Nur's Judgment, his second attack which keys nicely with his You Will Be Remade Through Me special ability, really wants you to be inflicting condition types on your opponents. But talk about someone who can dish out condition effects but can't take them - Apocalypse is immune to all conditions when you flip him over to his injured side. I can't think of any other model for the game that can do the same.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apocalypse-healthy-and-injured-cards.jpg?itok=HYVq4oI0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apocalypse-healthy-and-injured-cards.jpg?itok=4hrxNIK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So, how do you play Apocalypse? A lot of that comes down to really using him as the leader of the Servants of the Apocalypse affiliation. But just straight up as a 6 Threat miniature on the board, I could see him being very useful at eliminating threats and targeting your opponent's priority models. He doesn't have very good range, but get him in close and let him pummel your enemies, and you should be in good shape.</p>
<p>Now what's all this about his affiliation: Servants of the Apocalypse? This is, by far, the best way to utilize Apocalypse in your games of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. With this Affiliation, you'll assign Apocalypse the 'Master of the Horseman' card.</p>
<p>But who are the horsemen? When building a roster of 10 potential figures to bring to a match, you'll want to make sure those ten models are eligible to one of Apocalypse's Four Horseman. Atomic Mass Games has a handy chart to consult:</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/servants-of-the-apocalypse.jpeg?itok=EW_M7Ni3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/servants-of-the-apocalypse.jpeg?itok=Xg6bZLXB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When building your roster based on the Threat Level of the encounter, you'll squeeze as many horsemen from your roster in as possible, and each will be assigned their relevant card for whether they play the role of Death, Famine, Pestilence, or War.</p>
<p>Each of these cards offers useful - but not game-breaking - boosts, from dishing out damage to draining energy from nearby characters, and they all work towards helping Apocalypse evolve into more. And Apocalypse gains the powers of every horseman card on the field.</p>
<p>There are untold synergies here between the innate abilities of the characters you can use as your four horsemen, Apocalypse's ability to serve as a storage bank of energy for characters and fun interactions on the board. I have a feeling this could end up being very competitive, with lots of different iterations on the most potent combo of characters and abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/four-horseman-cards-marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse.jpg?itok=SA8pyRKE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/four-horseman-cards-marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse.jpg?itok=aHqTVTA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All of this is why, as I stated above, I think there's a lot of game packed into a single character pack, and bringing Apocalypse to the table opens up a lot of new play options for the inventive MCP player. But now let's talk about the new terrain sets that are coming out alongside Apocalypse (but sold separately).</p>
<h2>Dark Future Terrain Pack</h2>
<p>The Dark Future Terrain Pack starts our trend of bringing Apocalypse-adjacent terrain into&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. Featuring an overall look that combines Ancient Egyptian construction and style with futuristic Celestial Technology, Dark Future is the first of three exciting new Terrain Packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-future-terrain-pack-glossy.jpg?itok=SKy3VNBc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-future-terrain-pack-glossy.jpg?itok=RXa67fWJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This pack features 2 Regeneration Vat Miniatures, 2 Energy Syphon Miniatures, 4 Sacred Flame Miniatures, 4 Illuminated Crystal Miniatures, and - most importantly - two different One-Shot cards. First, the "Teleportation Network" reduces the overall threat value by -1, and allows players to teleport between Crystal Obelisk (Illuminated Crystal) pieces of terrain by interacting with them (Fun note: nothing in the rules says you can't destroy these obelisks and shut down the teleportation network).</p>
<p>The second One-Shot included in this is "Celestial Healing," which lets a character interact with a regeneration vat to remove 2 damage and 1 special condition at the cost of gaining the stagger special condition. Aside from these fun one-shots - and INCREDIBLE new addition - the miniatures themselves really do a nice job of getting the game away from the classic NYC-style terrain.</p>
<h2>Shrine To En Sabah Nur Terrain Pack</h2>
<p>This terrain pack consists of two small chest miniatures and one large, chunky Shrine To En Sabah Nur (remember, that's Apocalypse's real name) terrain piece. Solid and easy to construct, this model offers great cover and comes with a One-Shot that adds +2 to the Threat of a game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shrine-to-en-sabah-nur-glossy.jpg?itok=Yw4ELDAn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shrine-to-en-sabah-nur-glossy.jpg?itok=8eM5ZxCH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That One-Shot, "Trial of Survival," allows characters overlapping with the miniature to gain a bit of the power of Apocalypse, copying his ability to remove 1 damage every time they take a hit.</p>
<h2>Rejuvenation Chamber Ultimate Encounter</h2>
<p>Finally, there's the absolutely stunning Rejuvenation Chamber Ultimate Encounter. This huge terrain model, which at the time of this writing is still up for pre-order, features a massive Rejuvenation Chamber model. And it comes with a full Ultimate Encounter, "Survival of the Fittest."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rejuvination-chamber-glossy-large.jpeg?itok=XZ9sRb8w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rejuvination-chamber-glossy-large.jpeg?itok=anPL90eV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This Encounter, for three players, sees two players serving as the Crisis Team, each bringing their own squards to battle. The other player takes on the role of Apocalypse (sold separately) and four minions. And while it's a little bit odd that this is for three players exactly (not a normal player count), the game is in desperate need of more multiplayer formats/scenarios!</p>
<p>In the Encounter, Apocalypse hibernates while his minions attempt to grow his power, and after a certain point in the game Apocalypse will emerge, ready to fight! Depending on how well his minions did, he'll enter with one of four different character cards based on his "Evolution Count."</p>
<p>We haven't had a chance to playtest this Ultimate Encounter yet, but reading through the rules it looks like a very fun asymmetrical PvP format, and there's even a sliding difficulty scale!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-miniature-closeup.jpg?itok=O-R8Qjl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-miniature-closeup.jpg?itok=MXC2AjeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Marvel Crisis Protocol </em>Apocalypse Miniature and Terrain - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is an absolutely astounding set of releases all tied around Apocalypse, and it just shows how much care and dedication the team puts into&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. For such an iconic villain as Apocalypse, this is the kind of miniature and release schedule the fans deserve. And though it helps build out the board, you don't have to go all in on the (admittedly pricey) terrain to get the most out of your experience.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of the game and are considering diving into Apocalypse, you'll be pleased to know the character is done justice by its interpolation in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>.</p>

                <p>Majima fans have been waiting years for the Mad Dog of Shimano to make his return as a main story character.

Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) studio has released a seven-minute announcement trailer of its newest title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/" data-ref-id="5000-644699">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> where Majima shines again, and this time as the sole protagonist. Even though RGG has been releasing full-length games almost yearly, even longtime fans probably weren't expecting another game so soon or predicting Majima to return as a protagonist and a pirate. Plus, Yakuza's beat-'em-up combat and the series' best minigame both return--this is shaping up to be a great game!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</p>
      </div>
<p>As we saw in the trailer released last weekend, the game takes place six months after the events in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/" data-ref-id="5000-590944">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. Majima wakes up on a beach with no memory of how he got there or even his name. He is approached by a young boy, Noah (and his pet "cat" that is definitely a tiger) who tells him they are on an island near Hawaii called "Rich Island," before the duo are quickly confronted by pirates. Majima then meets Noah's dad, Jason, and learns about Nele Island--a dumping ground for waste and pollution that Majima and the yakuza are somehow involved in.</p><p>To recover his memory and solve the Nele Island problem, Majima must travel between the different islands of Hawaii as well as a new area called Madlantis--a hideout for gang members and criminal organizations run by a new character, Queen Michelle. He then, in true Majima fashion, takes over a pirate ship as the new captain and sets sail to solve the mysteries of these dilemmas.</p><p>It wouldn't be a true RGG title without an absurd premise, and what could be more absurd than Majima waking up on an island with memory loss and immediately becoming a pirate? Majima has had a lifetime of odd jobs: from Cabaret owner to construction manager to harassing Kiryu under different disguises, so it only makes sense another bizarre occupation would come along eventually. He's already got the eye patch, so why not conquer the sea as well?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375254-ss_8352ef639c0c52b316547ef16a825f06c0b91e39.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375254" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375254-ss_8352ef639c0c52b316547ef16a825f06c0b91e39.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375254"></a><figcaption>Majima was built to be a pirate.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375254-ss_8352ef639c0c52b316547ef16a825f06c0b91e39.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Following the trailer release and the story reveal, I had lots of questions regarding the gameplay with a playable Majima again. Thankfully I got the opportunity to play a brief demo.</p><p>It seemed like the turn-based combat style would become the norm for Like a Dragon games, but Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii brings back the Yakuza series' original beat-'em-up roots, including the iconic Heat moves. This style of combat feels more natural for Majima, whose outrageous personality might have been stilted in turn-based combat. In the demo, we are introduced to two of Majima's fighting styles: his signature Mad Dog fighting style and the new, Pirate "Sea Dog" style.</p><p>Majima may be 60 years old now, but that doesn't stop him from dancing around his enemies as if he was on the streets of Kansai again. The combat is just as over-the-top and wild as players would expect, with an added feature to use jump attacks in battle. The Mad Dog style is a modernized version that feels like a dream combination of his styles from Yakuza 0, using both his fists and tanto as weapons. There is also a new ability that allows Majima to "clone" himself to create doppelgangers, which are useful for taking down large groups of enemies.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="634849188"

By seamlessly switching to this stance, Majima transforms into a pirate, which mirrors how the characters in the previous Like a Dragon games transform into their "jobs" during battle. Majima is equipped with two cutlasses, a flintlock pistol, and a wire hook as weapons, and can easily switch between them for fun combos. I can only imagine how ridiculous the Heat moves will be in this style and I'm looking forward to exploring it more.</p><p>RGG games are famous for their abundance of side content and minigames to enjoy outside of combat, so, of course, the first thing I did after the battle demo was head straight to the karaoke bar. There were only a few songs on the playlist--there are brand-new songs like "The Sun at 36.5 C," and a few returning songs from previous games such as "As Long as You're Happy." I'm sure more songs will be added later, but Majima fans will be happy to know that Yakuza Pirate brings back the crowd favorite "24 Hour Cinderella" with the same glowing, rollerblading goofball serenading us. This time, however, we see him rocking the outfit as a 60-year-old man. I can honestly say that brought a tear to my eye.</p><p>Like a Dragon: Yakuza Pirate also brings back one of my favorite minigames in the series: Dragon Kart. I only got to explore one racetrack, but it was really fun to race around Hawaii with new characters and experience some of the new items featured in the game. It felt a little janky and intense in some turns, so hopefully it will be more polished before the game's official release.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375252-ss_2b5d18defaba64dd173a9656683584a461ab444e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375252" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375252-ss_2b5d18defaba64dd173a9656683584a461ab444e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375252"></a><figcaption>Madlantis is an incredible sight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375252-ss_2b5d18defaba64dd173a9656683584a461ab444e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>I also got to briefly explore Madlantis. Similar to the secret cities of previous titles, the streets of Madlantis are filled with neon lights and illegal gambling. I was impressed by the design of the fake city; the added shipwreck and pirate themes to the area made it feel like a fantasy land for organized crime.</p><p>One of my favorite new additions was the grappling hook, which I could use around the city. In certain areas of the map, Majima can grapple himself onto higher platforms to collect treasure and discover new heights. I loved using the spider grab in Like a Dragon Gaiden so it's pretty cool to see this mechanic updated. It also provides access to new areas to explore in the familiar Hawaii map.</p><p>Although my preview was short-lived, I got to experience a number of exciting new features and I adored playing Majima again. Though the game is brand new, it felt nostalgic running around the streets as the Mad Dog and I'm sure old-school fans of Majima will feel the same.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375253-ss_57384e54173bf628f97c6b1f8c47381e5c1d7439.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375253-ss_57384e54173bf628f97c6b1f8c47381e5c1d7439.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375253"></a><figcaption>Majima continues to be the most ridiculous man ever.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375253-ss_57384e54173bf628f97c6b1f8c47381e5c1d7439.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>I didn't get to explore the story much so I'll save my analysis on that for now, but it's been years since we've witnessed a more serious side of Majima and so I do have some wishes. I would love to see more soft moments with the character again. I really hope there will be some references to the side stories in Yakuza 0 and possibly some reunions with characters from previous Yakuza games. Maybe there will be some heartfelt moments with Kiryu too, or perhaps a run-in with a certain character that longtime fans know now resides overseas.</p><p>Whether the story will finally conclude the Mad Dog's saga or not, fans will be impressed with the new features Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii has to offer, which also finally scratches that itch for more Majima. The combat feels effortlessly fun, there seems to be a plethora of side content to explore, and, best of all, we can finally see the old Mad Dog shine once again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The inspiration for Nintendo’s new museum came, at least in part, from an ongoing irritation for Shigeru Miyamoto. At a certain point every year, the <em>Super Mario</em> creator does a presentation for the hundred or so new staff that have joined the company. It’s an attempt to explain the core of what makes Nintendo a creative force.&nbsp;</p><p>“I talk for two hours,” Miyamoto said during a roundtable interview ahead of the museum’s opening. “And after 20 years, I don’t want to do it anymore.”</p><p>The solution to that problem comes in the form of a two-story building that used to be a playing card manufacturing plant in Nintendo’s hometown of Kyoto. It opens on October 2nd, but visiting isn’t as simple as taking the train; tickets can only be reserved through <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/index.html">a random selection process</a>. If you do make it, though, you’ll be greeted with an experience that explores more than a century of the company’s history, dating back to 1889 when Nintendo got its start making hanafuda cards.</p><p>From the outside, the museum is nondescript, a bland gray structure that wouldn’t look out of place in an office block. (It’s not unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_development_teams#/media/File:Nintendo_Headquarters_-_panoramio.jpg">Nintendo’s central office,</a> also in Kyoto.) But the playfulness becomes more apparent the closer you get. You’re greeted by a series of warp pipes and floating blocks, complete with a mushroom (naturally), as you approach the entrance. Inside the door, there’s a quartet of colorful Toads, along with a framed copy of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shigeru_Miyamoto%27s_signature.svg">Miyamoto’s whimsical signature</a>.</p><p>The main floor has something of a theme park vibe. There are a handful of interactive exhibits, each meant to be a slightly modernized take on an older Nintendo product. Nintendo once made a batting machine, for instance, so you can head into quaint Japanese-style living rooms and knock balls around. There’s a version of a Game &amp; Watch platformer where you use your shadow to help a character cross perilous gaps and a shooting range where you can wield an NES Zapper to shoot virtual paintballs at classic <em>Super Mario</em> enemies. The most straightforward exhibit is simply a room filled with classic games, emulated through Switch Online. Also, there’s a love tester machine (another little-known early Nintendo product).</p><p>The floor’s highlight is arguably a room filled with massive classic controllers so big each requires two people to play. In order to get through <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>using an NES controller the size of a novelty check, one player controls movement with the D-pad, while the other handles running and jumping. If you want to fly in <em>Pilot Wings</em>, it takes two people to lift up the jumbo-sized Wii Remote and tilt it around to pilot a plane. These experiences are fun in the way you’d expect from Nintendo, especially as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">continues to refine its skills in designing physical spaces</a>. But I can’t say I learned much about the company from trying to use a huge N64 controller.</p><p>The actual history is located one story up. As you ride the escalator, you’ll hear a succession of bootup sequences from classic Nintendo consoles, queuing up a trek down memory lane. Here, the entire chronology of Nintendo is laid out in a sprawling series of products. There are those original playing cards with their beautiful floral imagery, of course, but also all kinds of products during what Nintendo retroactively calls its “age of exploration.” A quick glance shows a company trying lots of ideas to find what works: there are Disney-branded board games from the ’50s, and walkie-talkies and RC cars from the ’60s. The company made strollers and exercise bikes and camcorders and its own version of Twister.</p><p>Then, Nintendo got into arcade games and released its first series of home systems with the Color TV-Game, and the rest, as they say, is history. After that success, Nintendo largely stopped making things like Napoleon-themed board games (I did not make that up, it’s real) and firmly pivoted to video games. This is why the early part of Nintendo’s story is a relatively small part of the museum, though, since it’s the least-known part of the company’s history, this also left me wanting more. From there, it’s an impressively detailed collection spanning the hardware you know, from the Game &amp; Watch up to the Switch. Each section features all of the iterations of the hardware, various accessories, and a collection of the most notable (at least according to Nintendo) games that were released on it, displayed in their cases from various regions.</p><div><p>The company doesn’t skip over its failures</p></div><p>The space is filled with oddities. There’s the Panasonic Q, a version of the GameCube that could play DVDs; a pair of goggles for the original Famicom that added stereoscopic 3D to 8-bit games; and <em>Face Training</em>, a DS game that came with a camera so you could practice facial exercises. Some ideas felt ahead of their time (like the DS guide to the Louvre), while others were always a bad idea (like the classically cringe “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/18ezo0x/keep_it_in_your_pants/">keep it in your pants</a>” ad for the Game Boy Pocket). As someone who has played Nintendo games since the NES, there were plenty of things I had never heard of, particularly when it comes to the company’s earliest days. Even Miyamoto learned some things. He joined the company in 1977 but had never seen a Copilas — a line of printers Nintendo made during the ’70s — in the flesh. “Those were something that I had only heard about,” he says.</p><p>I also appreciate that the company doesn’t skip over its failures. There’s a section dedicated to the Virtual Boy — attendees can stick their face into a wall-mounted headset to get the full black-and-red 3D experience — and the Wii U area is as big as the other console exhibits. There’s even a small space for mobile games like <em>Super Mario Run</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225944/nintendo-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-mobile-ending-date">which no longer seem to be much of a priority</a>.</p><p>What’s missing is context. Each section has a few small tidbits of information, like the technology Nintendo was utilizing at the time or the initial goal of a new piece of hardware. You can see that <em>F-Zero</em> pushed the limits of the SNES with its pseudo-3D graphics or hear the enhanced sound that gave <em>Super Mario World</em> such memorable tunes. These are interesting on a surface level, but aside from laying things out chronologically, Nintendo otherwise leaves it up to visitors to connect the dots.</p><p>This open-ended nature makes it easier to explore at your own pace, but it also leaves out all kinds of important information. The descriptive labels found at a typical museum, with some brief details on each artwork, would’ve been very welcome here. Instead, the objects here mostly speak for themselves. There’s no indication of the cultural impact of any of the products; one section focused on Mario has copies of both <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. movies on DVD&nbsp;sitting in a corner, with no explanation. You wouldn’t know <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">one was a historic flop</a> while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">the other a massive hit</a>.</p><p>Even worse, there’s no mention at all of who made any of these important works. Aside from Miyamoto’s signature at the front door, I didn’t see a single developer named anywhere in the museum. It’s a shame because the company is home to some of the most iconic and long-tenured creators in the field. Not just Miyamoto, but also the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/18759918/super-mario-maker-2-nintendo-switch-takashi-tezuka-interview">Takashi Tezuka</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16213402/nintendo-yoshiaki-koizumi-super-mario-odyssey-interview-gamescom-2017">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">Shiro Mouri</a> of <em>Super Mario</em> fame; <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23721063/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-aonuma-fujibayashi">Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi</a>; <em>Animal Crossing</em> director <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188006/animal-crossing-new-horizons-design-interview-aya-kyogoku-hisashi-nogami">Aya Kyogoku</a>; and longtime <em>Kirby</em> developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo">Shinya Kumazaki and Tatsuya Kamiyama</a>. It’s hard to imagine many people know Nintendo’s history better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch"><em>Smash Bros.</em> boss Masahiro Sakurai</a>. And yet, you wouldn’t know any of those people had a hand in these influential games at all from visiting the museum.</p><div><p>The objects mostly speak for themselves</p></div><p>This is by design, as Nintendo touts itself as a product-first company. With the exception of Miyamoto, its creative talent isn’t given much publicity. And it likely won’t be an issue for the initial superfans who will be attending and who will already know much of that context. But it makes for an odd museum-going experience, one that provides no real sense of how these games came to be and the decisions — and people — who shaped them.</p><p>That said, there is a small and incredibly fascinating section of old hardware prototypes tucked away on the second floor — including an early Wii U concept with two Wii Remotes stuck to either side of a tablet — which gives a glimpse into what the museum could be like if Nintendo opened up a little more and showed more than finished, successful products. Miyamoto hinted that he’d like to add more similar features to the museum in the future. “When I put myself in the consumer’s perspective, I kind of want to see behind the curtains a little bit,” he says. We already know these rare views behind the curtain can be enlightening, like when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14781038/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-8-bit-prototype-gdc-2017">Nintendo revealed the original 8-bit prototype for <em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>.</p><p>That’s not the main goal of the museum, however. Instead, it’s about showing Nintendo’s vision of itself to the outside world, much as Miyamoto does for new employees each year. That’s especially important right now as the company reaches a critical junction in its history. It’s one that will be marked not only by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">a pivotal console transition</a> but also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">a continued push into new areas outside of video games, like theme parks and movies</a>. The bigger Nintendo gets, the more carefully curated its image seems to become.</p><p>“We thought that this museum is a great opportunity for both our employees as well as the fans to reconfirm what kind of company Nintendo is,” Miyamoto explained. “A lot of people may see Nintendo as a video game company. But what I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Nintendo Museum is a showcase of that image at a time when Nintendo is arguably at the height of its powers — but it does so without delving into any of the messy, human work that got the company to this point.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the MOBA-themed shooter, which is still in a wild experimentation phase, has been getting regular updates and balance changes. The latest patch is testing a novel new Anti-Cheat detection system for dishing out bans:</p><p> “When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards,” the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes from developer “Yoshi” read</a></span>. “The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players.”<br></p><p>The anti-cheat magic has already been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted out in the wild</a></span>. Once a cheater is transformed into a frog, all the can do is hop around helplessly while the other team shoots the crap out of them. It’s very similar to when Cloud and company get turned into frogs in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. Fortunately, it’s not a requirement. Anyone fed up or who just wants to move on a start a new match that will actually count can decline to humiliate would be cheaters this way. I’m not sure if there’s a voting system where all the players on a team get a say, which would also be funny. It’s a 6v6 game so who knows how the tie-breaker would get figured out. </p><p>In the meantime, Deadlock still doesn’t have a timeline for a full release or even an official open beta. I’ve been fortunate to play a little myself and it’s a lot of fun, though it definitely caters a bit to number-crunching RPG nerds. The <em>Dota 2 </em>influence is inescapable, from the creep waves to the upgrade progression, but it’s one of the better 3D MOBA shooters I’ve come across. We’ll see how it evolves as Valve continues testing what could be it’s next big breakout multiplayer success story. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Kojima has signed with talent agency WME, which the publication describes as his "his liaison in the world of TV and film."</p><p>He also went into detail about the future of Kojima Productions, breaking down his plan into three phases. The first phase, Kojima said, was all about Death Stranding and establishing it "within the games category and expand on global platforms, like Apple and PC and Sony." "This part is not necessarily difficult," he added.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/gettyimages-2153433780-1727459462458.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hideo Kojima is looking to Hollywood for some of his next moves.

But the second phase, Kojima revealed, involves "different forms of media: movies, anime, TV dramas, etc."</p><p>"Basically, expanding the game IP to other media," he continued. "That’s the second phase. That’s what we’re aiming for next. I created Kojima Productions under the scope of 'digital entertainment,' but I don’t think it necessarily has to be a video game. We could create a new IP from a game, or an anime, or a film, or something totally different. Anything is possible, and that’s the third phase."</p><p>That third phase certainly sounds a little more vague, but Kojima added that he "would like to work with talented people from around the world and create something new, with 'digital' being the keyword."</p><p>"It could be a movie, a game, or something else entirely," he continued. "I can’t die until then!

                <p dir="ltr">More than any other game company, Nintendo loves to play with its history. Just look at how many times the NES library has reappeared across virtually every console era--remakes in Super Mario All-Stars, re-releases on Game Boy Advance, playable titles in Animal Crossing, the Wii Virtual Console, NES Remix on Wii U, and NES World Championships on Switch. Characters like Pauline from Donkey Kong can disappear in the mid-'80s and suddenly reappear decades later. And for a quarter of a decade, the Super Smash Bros. series has essentially served as a digital museum of Nintendo's most iconic characters, worlds, and franchises. Given this fascination with its own history, it's surprising that it took this long for Nintendo to produce a physical museum. A week before its October 2 opening, I had a chance to spend two days at the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto. As a lifelong fan of the company who credits it with my early fascination with gaming, it was a tremendous and surprisingly personal experience that I won't forget.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's first-party titles have always been filled with a certain polish that can feel like magic at times, so it should serve as no surprise that the company's obsessive attention to detail translates to a physical space. As you enter the main building (well, after you pass the line of five Toads who sing if you bonk their heads around), you're ushered into a holding area before the escalator to the exhibit space. In this dimly lit room, silhouettes of various Nintendo consoles light up in sync with the sounds of their startup chimes. From there you step onto the escalator and are greeted with ambient console-menu music as you're ushered upstairs. The first visible element of the exhibit room is a scoreboard-style box hanging from the ceiling with screens on each side. It displays startup screens of various consoles such as the iconic GameCube intro. It's very cool to see the entrance to the museum replicate the feeling of turning on a Nintendo console, from the chime to the logo animation to the menu music.</p><p dir="ltr">As you reach the top of the escalator, you suddenly emerge in the center of 360 degrees of Nintendo's history. It's almost overwhelming to go from a dark room and escalator to a panorama of sights and sounds from Nintendo. Game displays, massive controllers, and dozens of screens surrounded me as I entered the space, and I found myself randomly walking to the left to look at my first display. It was for the Nintendo DS, and I spent a couple of minutes taking in a wall of game boxes before I decided that I needed to have an attack plan for the exhibits or I was bound to miss something.</p><p dir="ltr">I decided to go chronologically, starting from a display that showcases Nintendo's early history with toys and licensed products. My time with Nintendo began when I was four years old in 1988, and I was only vaguely aware of the company's history of making hanafuda cards and toys. It was surreal to see Disney products and Twister boxes with Nintendo's logo on them. As a huge WarioWare fan, I was delighted to learn about and see products that I had previously only known as goofy minigame elements--the cowboy that you shoot over, the Ultra Hand grabber toy, and the Ultra Machine baseball launcher, among others. Thanks to one particular item on the wall, I learned that the random old Love Tester that I've directed my Pikmin to carry back to Olimar's ship wasn't random at all.</p><p dir="ltr">After a few walls of toys, board games, and old commercials, Nintendo's pivot to video games is presented via a case filled with Game &amp; Watch devices. I primarily know of Game &amp; Watch via Smash Bros. and minigames in WarioWare and the Game Boy Camera, so it was cool to see the wide variety on display.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374958-interactive-exhibit_nintendo-classicslarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374958" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374958-interactive-exhibit_nintendo-classicslarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374958"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong on Famicom at the Nintendo Museum</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374958-interactive-exhibit_nintendo-classicslarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I entered the NES display and immediately felt my brain shift from, "Oh that's interesting, I haven't seen this before" to a flood of personal memories with dozens of games on the wall. Each console display has an inward-facing wall featuring a massive collection of games with their various North American, European, and Japanese boxes next to each other for the sake of comparison. You've probably seen examples of Kirby getting pissed off whenever he leaves Japan, and there are numerous examples of that in the museum.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who grew up playing games is sure to get a blast of nostalgia when they encounter so many titles from their past, but this hit was especially potent for me and my collector brain. I've spent so much time looking at cardboard boxes of games on eBay and analyzing creases, tears, sticker residue, water and sun damage, and names written in Sharpie. I occasionally encounter cardboard boxes of NES, SNES, Game Boy, GBA, and N64 games in good condition, but I have never seen boxes as pristine as these. With very few exceptions, every single box looks like it would have when you tore open the gift wrapping on a Christmas in 1988, 1991, 1996, or anywhere in between. The cherry on top? I asked a Nintendo rep if all of these games were CIB (complete in box), and he confirmed they were. It's hard to imagine a more flawlessly preserved collection of video games anywhere in the world.</p><p dir="ltr">These game displays take up a large percentage of the exhibit room, and their corresponding console is immediately identifiable thanks to the massive controllers that loom over every display. I spent a not-insignificant amount of time standing under these and staring straight up, marveling at the accuracy of these controllers' appearance and texture. It's seriously like someone took the machine from Honey, I Blew Up The Kid and pointed it at a pile of GameCube controllers and Wii Remotes, among others.</p><p dir="ltr">Above each game display are numerous screens that showcase gameplay from that console's titles. If the wall of dozens of Super Nintendo games isn't enough of a nostalgia hit, just glance up and you'll see Donkey Kong riding a minecart, Mario flying with his cape, and Star Fox battling a boss. One of the cooler AV features throughout the museum is the use of directional audio. When you're standing under one screen, you'll be hearing and seeing Uniracers gameplay. Take a step or two to the left and suddenly you're hearing and seeing Super Metroid. There are so many sources of audio in this room, but it never feels like chaos. Appropriate audio plays depending on what you're looking at, and if you're closer to the center of the room, it fades away so it doesn't feel like you're in a loud, blaring arcade. Of course, classic Nintendo tracks serve as the background music, so you might be listening to the soothing sounds of Delfino Island during your bathroom visit.</p><p dir="ltr">While the inside-facing walls of the console displays focus on the games, the outward-facing sides focus on the hardware, innovations, and features. Do you want to look at almost 30 Game Boy Advance SP variants in one place, including the one with the ad where Mario got a tribal tattoo? Boy, have I got the place for you. There's also a box filled with every transparent "Funtastic" variant of the Nintendo 64 that had me daydreaming about pulling off my own Ocean's Eleven heist. Most of these displays feature fairly common items, but I learned about the Super Game Boy 2--which only released in Japan--saw my first in-person 64DD, and was made aware of a wild peripheral that allowed people to <em>trade stocks online on the original Famicom</em>. Sadly, there was no shrine to the WaveBird to be found.</p><p dir="ltr">The museum overall is light on text, descriptions, placards, and other traditional elements of a museum. Most of this information is relegated to these outer-facing walls, with details about sales, franchises that debuted on that console, and particular hooks like the N64 featuring four controller ports or the Gamecube having a network adapter that supposedly let you play Double Dash online, despite me never knowing a single person that has ever successfully done that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374959-exhibition-building-2_second-floor-exhibit_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374959" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374959-exhibition-building-2_second-floor-exhibit_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374959"></a><figcaption>The GBA display</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374959-exhibition-building-2_second-floor-exhibit_05large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A clever display involves eight adjacent screens, organized from left to right to represent Nintendo's consoles chronologically from NES to Switch. They're synced on a cycle to show how the big first-party franchises evolved over time, meaning you'll see Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, and so on simultaneously. In another example of Nintendo's great attention to detail, not only does it sync the various games, it also syncs the specific gameplay moments. It's wild to see eight simultaneous depictions of Link retrieving the Master Sword or eight versions of Rainbow Road at the same time. Longtime fans are well aware of how games have evolved visually over the decades, but it's really impressive to see it laid out so cleanly.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the details that Nintendo has included are almost impossible to notice if you don't know what you're looking for. One wall is a collection of game and console manuals (organized chronologically like most things at the museum), and the wall behind them looks like a subtle wave design of sorts. But it's more than an aesthetic; it's actually an unlabeled graph that tracks the number of products that Nintendo was shipping at that point on the timeline. This is depicted by stacked lines up until the mid-2010s or so, where the lines start being replaced by dots. Before long, there are no more lines and only dots. That's because the stacked lines represent paper manuals, and the dots are products shipped once physical manuals went by the wayside. Nowhere is this spelled out or labeled. It's just another little detail that Nintendo crammed into this space. And speaking of hidden little details, I spotted more than one sneaky Pikmin hanging around the museum as well.</p><p dir="ltr">One corner of the exhibition room is dedicated to specific franchises. Mario is the biggest display, with his games assembled in bunches that correspond to his platformers, sports games, parties, and kart racers. In a decision that shocked me, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island was actually included in the display for the Yoshi series rather than among its mainline Mario series brethren. It's a glaring mistake and one that I need to bug my Nintendo contacts about until it's rectified.</p><p dir="ltr">This Mario display is in the back corner of the exhibit room, and in the lower corner of this display sits a little collection dedicated to Mario's movies. There are a few items from last year's tremendously successful movie, but I had to laugh when I noticed the DVD of the 1993 movie tucked away in the farthest corner of the farthest display. If it got any farther away from the center of the room, it would be outside in the courtyard.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the back corners, another one is labeled "Storage" but still features several interesting prototypes on display. Nintendo clearly went through a lot of ideas for the original DS design before landing on the final product, which must also be the case with the early Wii Remote prototype that looks like a Frisbee with a star in the middle of it. One of my personal favorite items at the museum is a pristine Ultra 64 (the original name of the Nintendo 64) along with its controller. I saw so many mockups and pictures of that thing in EGM and Game Informer growing up, and never thought I'd get the chance to see one in person.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm sure this all sounds like a lot to be located in just one exhibit room, and it's incredible to see how densely packed with gaming history it is. I certainly haven't listed everything, either. There's the display of fitness devices and games, a timeline of the evolution of the question mark block, the look at Nintendo's history of experimenting with stereoscopic 3D, and plenty more.</p><p dir="ltr">That's the second floor. The first floor mostly consists of interactive activities that are tied to various Nintendo products and the company's history. It's basically a collection of real-life minigames. Numerous rooms resembling batting cages are set up, but with the aesthetic of various rooms in a retro-themed house. It's meant to replicate how owners of the Ultra Machine--a Nintendo-produced pitching toy--likely interacted with it in the '60s and '70s. Each room is different, and I tried most of them, as hitting various objects with the balls triggers different effects. I knocked down shelves in the kitchen, started Mario tracks on a record player, and made bottles rotate so they said L-U-I-G-I instead of M-A-R-I-O. At the end of your 20 pitches, a screen asks you to grab a little broom and sweep the balls towards the front of the room, which I found oddly satisfying for some reason.</p><p dir="ltr">My favorite room was the one with the giant controllers. Miyamoto went wild with the Honey, I Blew Up The Kid machine in this room, featuring fully functioning giant replicas of the Famicom controller, N64 controller, Wii Remotes, and SNES controller. I played with all of them, and I had to laugh at the absurdity of attempting Super Mario Bros. speedrun strats on a controller the size of my front door. All of the controllers look and feel amazing, but the N64 was my favorite by a long shot. Using a massive analog stick to try to grab Bowser's tail is a blast, and I love that the Z trigger was activated by stomping on a little pedal on the ground.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374961-interactive-exhibit_zapper-%26-scope-sp_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374961" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374961-interactive-exhibit_zapper-%26-scope-sp_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374961"></a><figcaption>The Super Scope game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374961-interactive-exhibit_zapper-%26-scope-sp_02large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the bigger spaces is filled with Super Scopes, NES Zappers, and a giant screen. Visitors can compete in a shooting-gallery game in which you're able to aim impressively far across the room to hit another player's targets. There's a novelty to playing on a screen this big and with a Super Scope, but I found the game itself to be a little too reminiscent of a mediocre minigame from the Wii era.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of these interactive experiences are directly tied to the company's history. You'll use an Ultra Hand replica to grab balls from a conveyor belt, walk on a screen as you match cards with Japanese poetry on them, test your love connection with a fellow visitor via a version of Nintendo's Love Tester machine, and control huge Game &amp; Watch minigames with your shadow. One room is filled with basic kiosks that allow you to play from a library that's essentially the Nintendo Switch Online collection.</p><p dir="ltr">Everything on the first floor is played by scanning your museum pass, which is loaded with 10 coins upon entry. These experiences range between one coin for smaller exhibits like the kiosk games, two coins for the batting cages and big controllers, and four coins for the shooting gallery. It seems like visitors will have to really pick and choose what to play on the first floor, especially if they're with their families. It's not like you can just pay two coins and go into the big controller room and go nuts. Each short session with a big controller costs two coins per person and per game. So if you and a friend want to team up to beat Agahnim in Link to the Past, collect 50 coins in Super Mario 64, and get to the flagpole in Super Mario Bros., that's six of your Nintendo Museum coins right there.</p><p dir="ltr">Two interactive experiences take place in a separate building, which sits across a small courtyard. There, visitors can paint their own hanafuda cards with an easy-to-follow kit. This room has a very "elementary school art class" feel to it, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. It was a pleasant, low-key way to start my visit before I got bombarded with Nintendo's gaming history. In a nearby area, a second hanafuda activity involves playing a tutorialized version of the card game against another player. It's done with some really clever tech involving projectors and cameras that can identify what physical cards are being placed and suggest what to play next. Neither I nor my opponent had the slightest clue how to play prior to this, and by the time we left the room, we felt like we had learned the general flow of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Downstairs from the hanafuda activities is Hatena Burger, the museum's food offering. Considering how remarkable most of the museum is, I found this to be a fairly standard burger place. I'm glad there's some sort of non-vending machine food at the location, but it felt more like a utility than a standout part of the museum. The fries came in the form of little balls instead of normal fry style, which is cool, I guess. But maybe they're not even fries at that point; maybe they're just potatoes. Look, I'm not a chef.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374963-shop_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374963" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374963-shop_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374963"></a><figcaption>The Nintendo Museum store</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374963-shop_02large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It should come as no surprise that there is a substantial gift shop at the museum. It also came as no surprise to me that I wound up getting way more than was reasonable or even feasible to bring back to Minnesota. But listen: This place sells huge Nintendo 64 controller pillows, and that alone made it worth it to scramble to buy new luggage at Don Quixote so I could get it on a plane. There are sections for every Nintendo console, and they all have variations on coffee mugs, pens, pins, shirts, sticker sets, and more. It's got to be the only place in the world with walls full of Virtual Boy and Wii U merchandise.</p><p dir="ltr">I left with two giant bags of merchandise, realizing that I'm probably the prime demographic for this museum. I'm a 40-year-old man whose earliest memory is playing Super Mario Bros., and virtually every single display was filled with items that I had personal memories of and fondness for. I'm also more than willing to spend too much money on a pillow that looks like a N64 controller. If that also describes you, you're definitely going to have a great time at the museum. Once it's open, I'm curious to hear reports from more casual gamers, younger fans, and people who brought families. My experience will not be the same one that the public will get once October 2 rolls around. I had infinite coins and could experience all the activities without any lines. It was easy for me to hop into one of those batting cages and have a fun time, but I wonder how I'd feel if I had to wait in a line and spend a fifth of my allotted coins on that experience. It could also be hard to get in for a while (tickets are currently distributed via a lottery system), and the museum is not exactly located in an easy-to-access, tourist-friendly spot. I'm confident that hardcore Nintendo fans will be thrilled with what the museum offers and that the journey will be worth it, but I can't speak for others who aren't as immersed in the company's gaming history as myself.</p><p dir="ltr">What you get out of the museum will likely depend on what you bring into it. It feels personal in a way I've never really experienced at other museums. Sure, I can walk around the Met in New York City and be fascinated by the historical artifacts and artwork, but ultimately those don't evoke any personal memories of my life. When I walked around the Nintendo Museum, I couldn't help but timestamp all of these exhibits alongside my own experience with them. It took me back to thinking my babysitter was the coolest person in the world because I watched her beat World 8-4 long before I could. Then I moved on to the SNES section and remembered my dad rushing home during his lunch break because that would give us enough time to play a Super Mario Kart grand prix together before he went back to the store. I remembered countless Mario Party battles between me and my sisters and whatever unfortunate friend or family member who got roped in against us. I looked at the GameCube display and remembered how many friends I met during raucous Double Dash and Smash Bros. Melee sessions in my dorm room. The huge Wii Remote reminded me of how my grandpa never understood video games enough to play with me, but in the later period of his life, we'd play Wii Sports bowling together in his nursing home. Even an exhibit as recent as the Switch brought me back to when my dog Razor was a little puppy sleeping in my lap during 15-hour marathons of Breath of the Wild (a game that itself made me feel like a kid again). For me, these displays and exhibits were far more than simple assortments of video game boxes in shockingly good condition. They were a reminder of so many great memories in my life, and a reminder of why I love games and pursued them as a career. In talking to numerous other attendees at the event, I know that I wasn't alone in this feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't expect every visitor to the Nintendo Museum to be as affected by it as I was. But I suspect that if someone is interested enough to take the journey to Kyoto to visit it, they're likely enough of a Nintendo fan to find many things to love about it. And for those lifelong fans like me, it can be a truly touching experience unlike any other museum. It's an amazing look at a company that, despite its eccentricities and occasional missteps, has had a clear design philosophy, confidence, and focus on fun that dates back decades before Mario jumped over his first barrel.</p>

By the end of that year, squillions of PC gamers were frothing in anticipation of playing an online survival sim with heavy <em>The Last of Us</em> vibes, the game by then one of the most wishlisted on Valve’s store. But then in January 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-steam-delay-release-date-gamepl-1850029926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-steam-delay-release-date-gamepl-1850029926" target="_blank">out of nowhere, it was temporarily pulled from Steam</a></span>. Something to do with a trademark issue, they claimed. One so serious it would delay the game by a planned nine months. It all smelt very odd.</p><p>A since-deleted tweet from Fntastic stated, “Right before the release, Steam blocked our game page at the request of a private individual, because of the name <em>The Day Before</em>.” Which didn’t really line up with the accompanying news that they would also not be releasing a much-hyped gameplay video, and the announcement of a new, incredibly specific release date of November 10, 2023.</p><p>While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://uspto.report/TM/79314174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://uspto.report/TM/79314174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the trademark was real</a></span>, it seemed unlikely it would take nine months to change the game’s name, and a lot of people began speculating that perhaps the game was less...finished...than had previously been implied.</p><p>So almost a year later, it was perhaps less of a surprise that the game’s launch would be a complete and total disaster. Released December 7, 2023, it was dreadful, derivative and technically incompetent—and it wasn’t an MMO, either. In fact, it was nothing like the promised game. Rumors suggested that of the 200,000 copies that were sold, almost half were immediately refunded.</p><p>Just four days later on December 11, instead of announcing a plan to release patches and updates and get the game into a fit state, Fntastic instead just...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/day-before-zombie-mmo-steam-refunds-1851092622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/day-before-zombie-mmo-steam-refunds-1851092622">cleared out</a></span>. The game was removed from Steam entirely—again—and Fntastic began deleting all of their online presence. YouTube and Twitter accounts were wiped, and it was announced that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-volunteers-steam-wishlist-1849113533&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-volunteers-steam-wishlist-1849113533">scandal-ridden</a></span> developer had shut its doors.</p><p>By January 22, 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-steam-dead-game-1851185900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-steam-dead-game-1851185900">the game’s servers were switched off entirely</a></span>, and then two days later the not-quite-dead-enough company issued a statement to their X account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-bloggers-hate-campaign-1851192767&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-bloggers-hate-campaign-1851192767">explaining that the whole thing was actually the fault of “bloggers.”</a></span> You know, how when people write about all the dodgy shit someone’s up to, and then that causes the dodgy shit to have come into existence in the past, just so the blogger can write about it.</p><p>And Fntastic now has a Kickstarter for their new game! Who’s backing?!</p><p><em>Escape Factory </em>looks to be a combination of <em>Fall Guys</em> and the current trend for factory sims, where you play in co-op to control a bunch of cartoony people as they attempt to escape a trap-laden factory. Which, you know, sounds like a thing that would be popular as a <em>Fortnite </em>game mode. It’s likely not helped by the declaration that they need our funding support AND that it’s out this Halloween. Yeeeeaaahhhh.</p><p>Incredibly, the Russian developer has put out an appeal entitled, “Help Fntastic Return,” which seems a touch optimistic. In order to achieve this noble goal, we must support their Kickstarter campaign, join their Discord, follow their <em>new</em> social media accounts, and buy their merch. I swear to God, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fntastic.store/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fntastic.store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they have merch</a></span>.</p><p>Accompanying this, on their newly re-registered website, there’s a post entitled, “Everyone Deserves a Second Chance.” (Which, as it happens, isn’t actually true. Babysitters that eat your children don’t deserve second chances, for instance. “Well darling, yes, he <em>did</em> eat Samantha, but he <em>promises</em> he won’t even take a nibble of Kevin.”) You’ll be comforted to learn, however, that they are owning their mistakes.</p><p>“We deeply apologize to everyone for <em>The Day Before</em>,” the site says, “and take full responsibility for what happened.” Which is nice, because bloggers can finally take that weight of guilt from their shoulders.</p><p>They have a plan, and you know it’s a good one because it’s in a pdf. In it the company explains its intentions to “raise development standards” and “expand professionalism.” No, stop laughing, you’re being rude. It goes on,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The new Fntastic brand, embodied by its vibrant blue logo and bold geometric design, represents more than a mere visual update—it signifies the company’s renewed commitment to transparency and honesty.</p></blockquote><p>Honestly, everything about this is just brilliant. It’s accompanied by a new mission and vision, which are, in turn:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Our mission is to create games that will be loved for decades.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Our vision is to become one of the most loved game  companies by creating fantastic, innovative, and  emotionally engaging experiences.</p></blockquote><p>So, that’s all good, isn’t it! And with a goal of $20,000, Fntastic is well on its way with a total of $635 pledged when I started writing this article. Just let me refresh the page...It’s now $635.</p><p>There genuinely is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143630/Escape_Factory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143630/Escape_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo for the game on Steam</a></span>, and Fntastic are hard at work, deleting every negative discussion thread that gets posted to the game’s Store page. Apparently it’s also bad when people link to the asset packs the game is using.</p><p>But look, let’s not be unfair. While the $20,000 goal to make a game in a month (it’s TBA on Steam, but it <em>definitely</em> says “THIS HALLOWEEN” right at the start of the Kickstarter video!) might seem ambitious, the team are aiming higher. For instance, if they hit $50,000, they plan to make a Steam Deck version of the game!</p><p>At $100k it’ll come to PS5, and for $200k they’ll finally have enough to make the notoriously expensive Nintendo Switch version. Slap on another $50,000 and you’ll get a “unique soundtrack” for each location! But double up to half a million dollars, and get this: they’ll include “New Mode.” For real.</p><p>It’s just so wonderfully terrible in every regard, and I’m going to be watching every second of it.</p><p>But before I go, let me just refresh that Kickstarter one more time. $638! It’s taking off!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The roadmap includes three title updates between October 3 and November 21.</p>







<p>“Our team is currently working hard to address your feedback and deliver new content,” they said <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1839696602056814661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via social media</a>. “More title updates will be heading your way in the coming weeks along with the release of our first story pack on November 21st.”</p>



<p>The next update, Title Update 2, will have a focus on “bug fixes and improvements” and launches on October 3. On October 24, Title Update 3 will focus on quality of life improvements for the game. Finally, Title Update 4 will launch on November 21 and include updates to combat and stealth while adding free additional contracts.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the game’s first DLC story pack launches on November 21. Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card has Kay and Nix “infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament where they will face off against the legendary Lando Calrissian.”</p>



<p>Full details on all of the Star Wars Outlaws title updates from the roadmap will be available in the coming days and weeks. </p>

                <p>In the '70s and '80s, Steven Spielberg ushered in a new age of blockbuster movies with Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and more. But according to his son, Max Spielberg, the famous director is still a gamer at heart who just can't give up playing games on his computer.</p><p>Max Spielberg--who is the creative director and co-founder of the game development studio FuzzyBot--told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoDqKVExzkU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax</a> that it was his father who got him into gaming. And the elder Spielberg is particularly into shooters.</p><p>"He loves gaming, he's the one that got me into it," said Max Spielberg. "He plays games. He's a big PC gamer and so that's kind of our bonding point as well. He's like, 'Hey what's good, what new Call of Duty should I be playing, send me a list of the top five shooters, I'll get 'em downloaded and we can play 'em together when you come over to the house.'"</p><p>It's kind of charming that Spielberg would rather wait to play the games locally alongside his son rather than playing online. But Max Spielberg also revealed that he's been unable to get his dad to try any console games because he's too attached to playing with a keyboard and mouse.</p><p>"He's big into story games and I'm always trying to get him to play Uncharted," noted Max Spielberg.

"This is a game, but it's a game like no other. I can't go into too much detail, and it's also hard to explain," he said. "But it's a bit risky and a new challenge for me within the realm of games."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> OD | A New Hideo Kojima Game - TGA 2023 Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima is partnering with Oscar-winning filmmaker Jordan Peele for OD. He said after meeting with Peele in Los Angeles and chatting, he explained the concept for OD and asked Peele to join.</p><p>"He was really interested in it, so I asked him to join me," Kojima said.</p><p>Kojima is friends with many famous filmmakers, including Peele, Nicolas Winding Refn, Guillermo del Toro, and others. He said some of his movie-maker friends want to get into games but don't know how, and that's how his partnership with Peele came about.</p><p>"People in the movie or music industry love games, because they grew up with it, and I was really surprised by that. They may be filming movies, but they actually love games. I know people who are late to their shoot because they were playing games at home," Kojima said.</p><p>He added: "So, I tell those people, 'Then you should make games!' But they all say, 'I'd like to, but I don't know how” and say they can't do it. So, I thought, then why not do it together? And that's how I came to partner with Jordan Peele to make a game together."</p><p>When OD was announced, Peele said it was "unlike any other game; it's going to be crazy." The game will feature performances by actors Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier.</p><p>Kojima Productions is leveraging Microsoft's cloud gaming technology to make an "immersive" game that he says is unlike anything that's come before it. "It is a game, but at the same time a movie," Kojima said through a translator.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/OD-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official description</a> for OD states: "A Hideo Kojima game, OD explores the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to OD on fear--while blurring the boundaries of gaming and film."</p><p>In addition to Death Stranding 2 and OD, Kojima Productions is making an espionage game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>. Outside of games, Kojima is making a Death Stranding film with A24.</p><p>Kojima will <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/tgs-2024-Booth_Announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discuss more of Death Stranding 2 at Tokyo Game Show</a> this weekend on September 29. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p>

		<p>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian has been announced by GUST and Koei Tecmo as the new game in the Atelier series. There is very little information outside of the name and the reveal trailer, except that the game is set in the land of Lantarna, and that it will feature new protagonists for the series. You can see the protagonists and some of the game world in the reveal trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBcVz0OZodE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the second Atelier game in a month that has been announced by GUST and Koei Tecmo, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-revealed/">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a> was announced back in August, also for a 2025 release. However Atelier Yumia is targeting an early 2025 release, while Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian is likely to release afterwards.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/">Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Atelier game we reviewed was Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg, and in that review Miguel said,<em>&nbsp;“Atelier Marie Remake is simultaneously a return to form and a fresh step forward for the Atelier series. It’s incredible to experience the roots of this series, and as sad as I am about the barebones storytelling, the shifted focus to time-management and calendar events gives the game an addictive farm-simulator vibe that kept me glued to it for hours. I’m excited to see how ideas from this remake come forward to inspire whatever this series has in store for us next.”</em></p>

<p>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian is expected to be released for PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC via Steam. Unlike Atelier Yumia, it does not appear that this will release will be coming to Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours ago, Fntastic announced a grand return to game development with a ‘2.0’ rebrand and a new game called Escape Factory. Last year, the shady and deceptive developer released The Day Before, a rug-pull of a game that was taken offline days later, leaving thousands of players stunned and seeking refunds.</p>



<p>To accompany the return, the team at Fntastic put together a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of new games and to get the studio back on its feet. It has gone down with the community as well as a cup of cold sick, and as the company attempts to distance itself from those speaking out against them, dataminers have made shocking (but expected) revelations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-round-2">Round 2</h2>



<p>On social media, dataminers dug into Escape Factory, the free-to-play game assembled by Fntastic ‘2.0’. In particular, <a href="https://x.com/bsimser/status/1839703934925165023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user named ‘Occular Malice’</a> found that the game’s networking, lobby, and matchmaking mechanics are all examples of ‘Unity demo code’ that’s typically used by those learning to develop games.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the majority of the game’s codebase is made up of assets simply ‘flipped’ from the Unity store, many of which are free to use.</p>



<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Fntastic has been removing comments on the Steam forum talking about this ‘deception’. The team has also been actively blocking anyone on social media speaking negatively or critically about the game and the rebrand. </p>



<p>When we reported the news regarding Fntastic’s attempt to resurface around 18 hours ago, the Kickstarter campaign had reached just £154 out of a goal of £11,646. It’s now sitting on £370 with 23 backers – and speaking frankly, anyone deciding to back this campaign will have nobody to blame but themselves when it inevitably goes belly-up.</p>



<p>Despite claims of honesty, transparency, and professionalism, <strong>nothing in the world </strong>will make gamers trust Fntastic ever again, and it’s laughable that they’re even trying to make a comeback.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on this fiasco? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's shock announcement Nintendo is suing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> maker Pocketpair for the infringement of "multiple patents rights", an IP expert has claimed it's "exceedingly plausible" Nintendo crafted its patent applications specifically to target Palworld.
</p>
<p>
Writing for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendos-patents-were-designed-to-take-on-palworld">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Andrew Velzen - an associate at law firm MBHB - started by summarising some of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">intellectual property discoveries</a> legal experts have made so far since word of Nintendo's lawsuit surfaced last week, starting with four key patent applications highlighted by Japanese attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara. 
</p>
<p>
These patent claims, explains Velzen, all relate to different aspects of catching and/or riding "combat characters, "airborne rideable characters", and "field characters" using "player characters." Notably, all four patent applications were filed onto pre-existing "parent" patents by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <em>after</em> the release of Palworld, and have ben accelerated to issuance using Japanese expedited examination procedures.

<p>
However, Velzen notes Nintendo didn't stop there. The company also filed two similar patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in May 2024, again after the release of Palworld, and several months after The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">announced</a> it would be investigating whether Palworld infringes on any "intellectual property rights related to Pokémon".
</p>
<p>
One of these US patent applications (US-App-3) relates to the in-game activity of throwing either a "catching item" or "fighting character" in a virtual space, while the other (US-App-4) focuses on boarding an object - selected from several objects the player characters owns - in order to provide instructions causing it to move, with specific mention of this happening while airborne. As with its Japanese patent claims, Nintendo paid to have the examination of its patent claims substantially expedited.
</p>
<p>
"Based on this information," Velzen says, "it is not overly speculative to assume Nintendo filed [its US patent applications] with the intention of targeting Palworld." He adds it's also "exceedingly plausible that these claims were crafted to read on aspects of Palworld."
</p>
<p>
While Nintendo's lawsuit is only targeting Japan at present, Velzen notes it's of interest that the company's US patent claims have both been been rejected during the expediated examination process - US-App-3 "only for lacking subject matter eligibility" and US-App-4 for "obviousness". Nintendo still has until October to amend its claims and/or argue against the rejections to try and get its applications across the finish line.
</p>
<p>
"If (i) Nintendo's litigation proceeds reasonably successfully in Japan and no global settlement is reached and (ii) the claims in the patent applications above do not require substantial modification in order to arrive at allowance, Nintendo will undoubtedly have the opportunity to file a similar suit for patent infringement in the US," Velzen explains, before adding "These are, admittedly, two pretty substantial 'ifs'."
</p>
<p>
"Regardless, though," he continues, "I think we are seeing just how seriously Nintendo views the threat of Palworld."
</p>
<p>
In a statement last week, Palworld developer Pocketpair confirmed it had received notice of Nintendo's legal action, but said it was "unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon". It has, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, to ensure small studios are "not hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".
</p>
<p>
The developer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">released Palworld for PS5</a> across 68 countries and regions this week, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworlds-ps5-console-release-on-hold-in-japan">Japan wasn't one of them</a>, leading many to assume Nintendo's lawsuit is to blame.

            <p>I must confess, it was not till this very hour that I envisaged the possibility of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> party consisting exclusively of clowns. There's a fine tradition of clown characters in RPGs - Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI, Harle from Chrono Cross, the Jester in Darkest Dungeon - but a whole party's worth? The full big top? The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clowned-king">Clowned King</a>, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keylocker-preview-bitsummit-turn-based-rhythm-rpg-cyberpunk">Keylocker</a>. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.</p><!--more-->

<p>Clowned King is a turn-based tactics-me-do set in the Moonlit Kingdom, a world of tinted glass and, from the looks of things, pugnacious brocolli. You are Matheus, a disgraced harlequin prince who "conceals his bloody past behind a mask of laughter", and you're on a mission to recruit some badass buffoons so that you can do a darkside Heath Ledger on your villainous father, the Mad King Marduk.</p>
<p>The game's battle system takes inspiration from "Disgaea, Fire Emblem and Brazilian culture", according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3195150/Clowned_King/">Steam page</a>, and puts the spotlight on formations, which unlock special abilities. I wonder if the appropriate word here isn't "formation" but stagecraft? If this game doesn't make every last feature an expression of clown culture, it'll be a sorry waste of a premise, to say nothing of a solid 7/10 title pun.</p>
<p>We can also expect "an immense amount of mage class types", which feels apposite -  when clowns spec for melee, it tends to be because they're horror movie clowns, who favour axes over hand buzzers. RPG clowns are more of a bard variant, I guess. Combat aside, you'll be "[bonding] with leaders from opposing realms to help support your fight against the Mad King". Ah yes, clown politicking, so unlike the regular kind.</p>
<p>Clowned King is out... at some stage.  While you wait, why not sample precision platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-precision-platformer-clown-meat-you-have-to-cheer-up-a-godzilla-sized-clown-from-jupiter">Clown Meat</a>, in which you have to cheer up a jester of planetary scale and misery, who spawned within Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Or how about the classic point-and-clicker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dropsy">Dropsy</a>, in which the title character just wants a hug. Come to think of it, we're probably overdue a clown game in which the clown <em>isn't</em> an emblem or metaphor for sorrow and insanity. If you know of one, I'd love to hear about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
