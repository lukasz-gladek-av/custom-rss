However, it looks like the publication is gearing up for a return based on posts on its social media channels.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The magazine’s Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, and YouTube channels have all been revived and now feature a teaser video of a laptop screen displaying the goodbye message that has been sitting on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Informer </em>website</a></span> since it shut down in August. That message was notably not written by any of the staff members and was the only thing you could see on the website for the past seven months after GameStop wiped the publication’s online archive. But in the teaser, the screen glitches out, and the text “{CONSOLE.WRITELINE (CONTINUE?);” appears on the bottom right corner. It ends with a date, March 25, 2025, teasing some kind of announcement next week.</p><p>After the teaser went live, several members of <em>Game Informer</em>’s staff at the time of the shutdown have posted similar teasers on their personal social media accounts, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-content director Brian Shea</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former editor-in-chief Matt Miller</a></span>. So if you were worried that GameStop had revived <em>Game Informer </em>as some kind of AI slop machine, take heart: it looks like some of the people who were working at the site before its shutdown are involved.</p><p><em>Game Informer</em>’s closure in August was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-informer-magazine-shutting-down-closed-react-staff-1851611950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-informer-magazine-shutting-down-closed-react-staff-1851611950">a brutal blow not only to the games media landscape</a></span> but to video game history, as the publication had provided a window into the work of many beloved developers and the evolution of many popular franchises throughout its 33-year run.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-inzoi-multiplayer-single-player/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-inzoi-multiplayer-is-it-single-player.1139211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-inzoi-multiplayer-single-player/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Outside of official mods, it’s very rare to see a life-sim title enable multiplayer in any capacity. With Inzoi looking to take the genre by the scruff of the neck, we’re drawing our attention to Inzoi and whether it has multiplayer or focuses solely on single-player.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a>‘s prerelease images and footage makes the soul feel warm. People playing together in a band or a couple enjoying the creation they conceived together. Everything we’ve seen looks friendly and instills a sense of togetherness. Your job in Inzoi is to micromanage the existence of Zois—plural being the key here. </p>



<p>Each city you build is crawling with characters, but can you bask in your vision with another person?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-inzoi-be-multiplayer">Will Inzoi be Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No buddying up yet. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Currently, Inzoi will not support any multiplayer features at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Like The Sims and other life simulators, there is no multiplayer in Inzoi. Outside of potential mods, this is a strictly single-player-only game. You only have to look at the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzoi Steam page</a> to see the big “Single-Player” category assigned to it.</p>



<p>This is designed to be your world, your life, and it’s for your eyes only. However, I did say there is no multiplayer at launch. It doesn’t necessarily mean Inzoi won’t feature multiplayer content at any point in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-multiplayer-be-added-to-inzoi">Will Multiplayer be Added to Inzoi?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Inzoi Team is contemplating adding “various multiplayer features” to Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>In the Inzoi <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1220564610151878696/1349181911481843722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord server’s FAQ</a>, a question asks: “Will the game be multiplayer?” Here’s what the official response says: “We are currently considering various multiplayer features, <strong>such as the ability to meet up with other online players or invite them over to your home.</strong> But specific details have not been decided.”</p>



<p>This feels more uplifting, wouldn’t you agree? There’s no timeframe mentioned as yet though as the team probably wants to ensure the Early Access launch goes smoothly first. We already know a ton of free DLC is coming courtesy of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a>. We’ll keep you posted if the game does decide to integrate multiplayer into the main game.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does a lack of multiplayer put you off buying Inzoi? Or are you motivated to create virtual worlds with the foresight of potential forthcoming multiplayer content? Share your thoughts either here at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> or on our lively <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dungeons &amp; Dragons has spawned numerous fictional settings for players to explore, but one of the biggest and most detailed is Dragonlance. The high-fantasy world, known as Krynn, was crafted by authors Laura and Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, but rather than just serving as a campaign setting for dungeon masters and players to explore, Weis and Tracy Hickman further developed the universe into a sprawling series of novels, expanding Dragonlance's popularity beyond just D&amp;D players, and cementing it as one of the more prolific fantasy settings ever conceived. If you've ever wanted to get into the series, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fworld-dragonlance-wizards-coast-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-26-dragonlance-novels-for-just-18-this-month%2F1100-6530195%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble's new The World Of Dragonlance Book Bundle</a></strong> includes up to 26 Dragonlance novels for $18.</p><p dir="ltr">Like all Humble Bundles, this is a pay-what-you-want deal where the more you pay, the more books you get. A portion of revenue is donated to charity--in this case, Room to Read, which helps children in low income communities learn reading, literacy, and life skills. You can also increase your pledge if you want to contribute more to charity, and the bundle's store page includes a slider so you can adjust the revenue split between Humble, Wizards of the Coast, and Room to Read.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the books you get, the base $1 tier includes three books: Dragons of a Fallen Sun, Dragons of Lost Star, and Dragons of a Vanished Moon. These novels were written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the co-authors of the original Dragonlance series, and comprise the War of Souls trilogy. Like other Dragonlance arcs, the War of Souls Trilogy can be read as a standalone series, making this $1 bundle a great introduction to the fantasy setting.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to expand your collection further, the $10 seven total ebooks, including the War of Souls trilogy, plus The Soulforge, Brothers in Arms, Amber And Iron, and Amber And Blood. The best deal, however, is the $18 tier, which gets you a whopping 26 Dragonlance novels in ebook format, including the original Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy. That equates to a $207 value.

<p>The February 2025 releases of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is more than just one of the most successful launches of the year. The long awaited sequel produced more than five times the amount of launch month dollar sales than the original, even during a stacked release month.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-outperformed-the-original-in-reviews-and-sales">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Has Outperformed The Original in Reviews and Sales</h2>



<p>According to the latest monthly United States video game sales data from Circana, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was the second best selling premium game of February. Additionally, it’s also the second best selling premium game of 2025 so far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sitting below Monster Hunter Wilds on both charts</a>.</p>



<p>But Circana’s video game analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5tjhs2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> an additional piece of insight about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launch. According to Piscatella, the “launch month dollar sales total Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reached in February 2025 was more than 5 times higher than that the original [game] achieved during its February 2018 debut.” Since both games were originally priced at $59.99 USD, this effectively means that the sequel sold five times more than the original did during its launch month. However, the sequel did have a slight advantage in that it released on February 4th, while the original released February 13th.</p>



<p>Even though it had a week more of sales to tout compared to the original, the critical reception to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 show how popular the sequel is. The first game garnered a 76 from critics according to MetaCritic and an 83% positive rating on Steam, which is by no means bad. The sequel though achieved a Metacritic rating of 88, and a 93% positive rating on Steam.</p>



<p>Will Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 finish 2025 as one of the top 10 best selling games? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

the holy two-handed sword Ashbringer. It will be the first time WoW Classic players will be able to get their hands on a non-corrupted version of the weapon, despite players back in the vanilla WoW days tirelessly trying to discover a way to no avail. However, players of the modern "retail" version of WoW were able to use Ashbringer as part of the game's 2016 Legion expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">How, exactly, players will purify the Corrupted Ashbringer and restore it to its former glory is still under wraps, but the datamining sleuths at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/how-this-legendary-weapon-may-be-coming-to-season-of-discovery-in-phase-8-375915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a> have some theories. If you don't want spoilers, stop reading now! Based on datamines, in typical WoW Classic fashion, the quest to restore Ashbringer looks like it will be a globe-trotting affair. The quest may even take players to previously unseen areas in WoW Classic like Mount Hyjal and the Well of Eternity.</p><p dir="ltr">Wowhead has also <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/possible-bosses-coming-in-the-scarlet-enclave-raid-season-of-discovery-phase-8-375982" rel="nofollow ">datamined</a> possible bosses for the Scarlet Enclave raid, and one of them will be a very familiar face to longtime WoW players. Spoilers if you don't want the contents of the raid revealed, but it looks like players will face off against none other than Lillian Voss. In modern WoW, Voss is a prominent undead character who first appeared in the game's Cataclysm expansion, where she infiltrated the Scarlet Crusade in a quest of revenge against those who wronged her.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she was turned undead, she was a fanatical member of the Scarlet Crusade, but her exact backstory, or the manner of her death, has never been revealed. Just as was the case when players believed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-think-the-war-within-big-bad-is-secretly-in-season-of-discovery-too/1100-6520312/" data-ref-id="1100-6520312">Season of Discovery included appearances from WoW: The War Within's main villain Xal'atath</a>, it looks like Blizzard is once again tying together its two eras of WoW in an exciting way.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the raid's final boss, that also looks to be a familiar face--the dreadlord Balnazzar. Previously seen in the game's Stratholme dungeon posing as a member of the Scarlet Crusade, it looks like he has now attempted a full-blown coup, and it will be up to players to dethrone him once and for all.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be next for WoW Classic Season of Discovery is still unknown, but Blizzard has said the experimental seasonal servers will continue to exist in some form even after new content is no longer in development. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW: The War Within just received its goblin-themed Season 2 update</a>, as Blizzard continues to share more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">details on the MMORPG's highly anticipated player housing system</a>.</p>

College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in <em>College Football 26</em> and beyond.”</p><p>It’s believed that around 11,00o players will allow their likenesses and names to be used in <em>College Football 26</em>, which is roughly the same as last year.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The wait has been so unbearable that even a casual mention, like the one Xbox dropped in a recent ID@Xbox post, can ignite the fires of those holding out for a 2025 drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, ID@Xbox director Guy Richards shared a post detailing how over $5 billion have been paid to independent developers through the program. It mostly goes over the success of past ID@Xbox launches, ranging from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/neva">Neva</a>. Then, in a portion about upcoming games, we get the name-drop:</p><blockquote>"Looking ahead, our lineup is incredible with upcoming games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Descenders Next, and FBC: Firebreak to play across the whole Xbox universe… and of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!"</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This mostly confirms that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch sometime between me typing this, right now, and the end of all time. Granted, those games are interesting mentions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is set for April 24, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/descenders-next">Descenders Next</a> for April 9, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> has had a tentative 2025 window. This could imply Hollow Knight: Silksong is within some measure of grasp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are, to some degree, understandably impatient to learn whether Silksong might arrive, as it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">been roughly six years since its announcement</a>. Now, let's see how the Silksong faithful are reacting to this mention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Where's the bait?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1je8o1b/silksong_is_officially_mentioned_in_an_official/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter asked</a> on the Silksong subreddit. Another said: "Silksong being mentioned by Xbox?" and followed it up with an image of the Squid Game Season 2 scene where protagonist Seong Gi-hun declares: "I have played these games before!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a palpable air of both joking and irony that comes with communities like this, where groups have essentially bonded over waiting for news about something. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jetj81/i_swear_we_are_a_circus_at_this_point/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another post</a> draws attention to this, noting that "we" — the Silksong holdouts — are a "circus at this point," making their point with the Patrick Star/Man Ray meme format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prevailing hope, or joke, is that news about Hollow Knight: Silksong is destined for April 2, during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct</a>.

                <p>Even though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">inZoi</a>, the new life sim from Krafton that aims to be the first real competitor to The Sims, won't officially release until March 27, you can get a head start on the creation aspect of the anticipated new game with the free inZoi Creative Studio starting March 20. The Creative Studio won't let you do any of the simulation part of the game, but it <em>will</em> let you dabble with inZoi's character creation and build mode.</p><p>There's a little bit of a catch, though. For the first few days--March 20-23--you'll need to unlock access via streaming drop on Twitch or Chzzk, which will require you to link your Krafton account and watch an inZoi stream for 15 minutes, or on Steam itself. Steam will be the easiest option--you just have to watch a livestream from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inZoi's product page</a> for 30 minutes, and a key for the Creative Studio will be granted without remembering any additional logins.</p><p>There are only a limited number of keys that can be obtained from drops, but if they run out you won't have to wait too long. Starting March 23, the inZoi Creative Studio will become available for anyone on Steam to download for free. And you'll probably appreciate having the chance to go wild on character creation ahead of the release of the rest of the game, since inZoi features a rather intense level of customization built in--you can literally design your own clothing items from scratch, for one thing. It's a lot to absorb even without thinking about the simulation part.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Krafton hosted a very lengthy streaming showcase that went deep on everything inZoi will have to offer at launch, plus the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/" data-ref-id="1100-6530201">game's roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025, and you can check that out below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkXfP9rwrm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QkXfP9rwrm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>InZoi launches in early access starting March 27 on Steam for $40. Krafton has said that until inZoi reaches its full 1.0 launch, all updates will be included in that price--so no paid DLC for this one for a while.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has discussed the game's future following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">impending sale to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a>, which is owned by the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group, in a deal worth $3.5bn.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy video interview with veteran Pokémon Go YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3HawhQy78&amp;ab_channel=TrainerTips">TrainerTips</a>, senior product director Michael Steranka discussed several of the main concerns among the game's huge playerbase about the upcoming sale.
</p>
<p>
Asked whether Pokémon Go would ever get pop-up ads to drive more revenue, or share player location with either Scopely or Savvy, Steranka gave an emphatic no.
"That will never happen, I'm saying that right here now," Steranka said about the idea of pop-up advertising appearing in-game. 
</p>
<p>
As for player data, including scanned locations, this will still be shared with Niantic even after the sale, but will not leave the company's US-based servers.

<p>
"Anything players still scan or submit through [Niantic's location-adding software] Wayfarer or otherwise, that data does still get shared back to the Niantic Spatial organisation, but all that data is still fully encrypted and protected in all the ways we have been doing up until now - which is honestly best in class," Steranka continued.
</p>
<p>
"Contrary to popular belief, we don't store any player data beyond what's needed to actually operate the game, everything is fully anonymised and it's all stored on US servers. And in accordance to regulatory laws, to make sure your data is as safe and sound as possible. None of that is changing."
</p>
<p>
Asked specifically if it would be shared further by Pokémon Go's incoming owners, Steranka said no. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not shared up with Savvy or otherwise," he said. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking about the wider context of the deal, Steranka said it had been "in the works for a little while now" and made sense to separate the two halves of Niantic - the one focused on gaming, and the other focused on location mapping. 
</p>
<p>
"As you, and many other players in the community could tell, I'm sure, even from an outsider's perspective, Niantic's always had a little bit of a dual personality," Steranka said.  
</p>
<p>
"It naturally made sense to build on this [geolocation] platform that was all about servicing those kinds of applications, but I will say it did also lead to competing priorities, or more regularly too many priorities for the team to focus on, or lean into.
</p>
<p>
"In terms of what's good for Pokémon Go, this is absolutely one of the best things that could be happening to the game," Steranka said, adding that he hoped it would allow the game's design time to focus solely on what's best for the product.
</p>
<p>
While the development team will "still have full autonomy in our games and the decisions we're making", there will be "less of an emphasis on scanning" in future, Steranka added. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go's mission to get people outside is also "not changing", Steranka said. 
</p>
<p>
As for how Pokémon Go may be further monetised in future, Steranka said Scopely understood how profitable the game was already, and that it would not be wise to tamper with it.
</p>
<p>
"They've been very intrigued and impressed by how we monetise games," Steranka said, explaining that Pokémon Go was a rare example of a free-to-play mobile game where a lot of players pay a little bit, compared to other games relying on only a few players who pay a lot. 
</p>
<p>
Compared to the other paths open to Niantic, the sale to Scopely meant Pokémon Go's team would not have to deal with shareholders by splitting off or dealing with another kind of owner, Steranka concluded.
</p>
<p>
Niantic confirmed its plans to sell Pokémon Go, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> to the Saudi-backed Monopoly Go maker Scopely earlier this month. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Pokémon Go fans had expressed deep concern over Scopely's acquisition</a> of the game, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">word of the deal was reported online</a> - something Niantic has continued to try and assuage. The hugely-popular mobile game has over 20 million weekly active players, with an average of 40 minutes daily playtime, and is set to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' launch has been extremely successful in the United States, where it became the best-selling game of the month of February and the current best-selling game of the year in a single day of availability.</p>
<p>According to data shared today by Circana (NPD), the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM was the overall best-selling premium game in the United States, topping the sales charts of every platform it has released on - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam - followed by two other February releases, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">Civilization VII</a>. While the game sold great on all platforms, it was a smashing success on Steam, as the PC ecosystem accounts for more than half of the title's total dollar sales.&nbsp; With the game also being the current best-selling game of the year in the United States, it definitely looks like the first proper, simultaneous PC and console release for the series paid off big time.</p>

<p><br>
That Monster Hunter Wilds has been a smashing success, there was no doubt, as CAPCOM itself reported to have sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">eight million copies in only three days</a>, becoming the fastest-selling game in the publisher's long history. A success that is completely deserved, as the game is, despite some shortcomings, incredibly fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>

<p>If you have not played GTA Online in the past 60 days, you might be eligible for Rockstar’s one-time exclusive offer, which gives players $3 million in-game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right: Rockstar is offering players $3 million in-game to return to GTA Online, but there’s a catch. Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/532607/article/rockstar-games-trying-to-win-some-gta-online-players-back-with-3m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players should meet a set of eligibility requirements before claiming the in-game currency. Moreover, Rockstar only offers $1 million for free; for the remaining $2 million, players would need to make additional purchases, including buying a Shark Card and subscribing to GTA+.</p>



<h2 id="h-eligibility-requirements-for-claiming-3-million-in-gta-online">Eligibility Requirements for Claiming $3 Million in GTA Online</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players should have a Rockstar Games Account that’s linked to their platform.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Claim the offer on Rockstar’s <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players should not have signed into GTA Online in the past 2 months (60 days).&nbsp;</li>



<li>The account should not have received a ban or suspension from Rockstar at any point.</li>



<li>The offer should not be redeemed already.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-3-million-in-gta-online">How to Claim $3 Million in GTA Online?</h2>



<p>To claim the $1 million, the player must claim the offer from Rockstar’s website and sign in to GTA Online using the same account. Once done, players will receive the in-game money within 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To receive the additional $1.5 million, players must purchase a Great White, Whale, or Megalodon Shark card.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the final $500,000, players need to subscribe to GTA+. If you are already a GTA+ subscriber, you can still claim the money if you haven’t played GTA Online in the past 60 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, GTA 5 Enhanced has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst-rated</a> Grand Theft Auto title on Steam.

<p>United States video game sales data for February 2025 has been released. Not only is Monster Hunter Wilds the best-selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game of the month</a>, but it’s the best selling game of 2025 through two months.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of the month for PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. When looking at the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam data</a>, it has accounted for “more than half of the title’s total dollar sales”.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Monster Hunter franchise, the release of Monster Hunter Wilds doubled that of Monster Hunter Rise in terms of dollar sales. It’s worth noting that Monster Hunter Wilds launched at $69.99 while Rise launched at $59.99.</p>

<p>Looking elsewhere at the data, Monster Hunter Wilds wasn’t the only new release to make it into the Top 20 best-selling games of 2025 so far. Other new titles to make the list include Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (2nd), Civilization 7 (3rd), PGA Tour 2K25 (6th), Avowed (13th), and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii (18th).</p>



<p>The prior top game, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, remains in the top 5. However, it has fallen to 4th on the list while NBA 2K25 fell from second to 5th.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developers at GSC Game World have been through a lot, to put it mildly. Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-stalker-2s-developers-persevered-as-russians-invasion-of-ukraine-began/1100-6529870/" data-ref-id="1100-6529870">full-scale Russian invasion in 2022</a>, roughly 200 developers opted to relocate to Prague in the Czech Republic, continuing to collaborate with their colleagues in Kyiv. This, in theory, should have led to a more peaceful development process for this group, but a large fire in the Prague office threw another unexpected wrench in its plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The fire, which broke out in late 2023 in the Prague office's server room, partially wiped out one of the floors. No one was hurt, but post-accident images of the damage show scorch marks and ash covering the ground. GSC Game World CEO Ievgen Grygorovych seems to view the situation as a sort of blessing in disguise, as he explained to us in the latest GameSpot Insider documentary.</p><p dir="ltr">"It actually made us stronger because we got to experience what can happen, how it may look--what we have to do to not let it happen again," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSH5O1KLSI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8KSH5O1KLSI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There was certainly a material cost to the accident, though. In addition to the server on the floor being destroyed, developers' work computers were also destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was one more challenge to rebuild this game again," lead community manager Yevhen Bazarov said. "One more thing we weren't expecting."</p><p dir="ltr">While he's able to laugh about it now, lead cinematic artist Ingwar Dovgoteles was working on a cinematic-department documentation job that took roughly three days. He had finished it late the night of the fire. About 15 minutes after he got home, he got a call from the office that everything he had worked on was gone.</p><p dir="ltr">"All my work was there," Dovgoteles added. "[Done] in three days with all this documentation. It was just wasted."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for GSC Game World, despite yet another setback, Stalker 2 did eventually release in late 2024, and it was one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">best games of 2024</a>.

			<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 Pro upgrade is among the largest we have seen so far, according to a new in-depth analysis of the soon-to-be-released new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the one thing that elevates the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience on the PS5 Pro over the base model is how Performance Mode leverages the power of the system to deliver 60 FPS gameplay, though with some drops in certain scenarios, with the ray-traced global illumination available only in Quality Mode on the base system. As seen in the footage below, RTGI makes quite a bit of a difference, even when, on both base and Pro systems, the game features similar image quality, internal resolution, which is only marginally higher on PlayStation 5 Pro, and graphics settings. Other than sporting RTGI in Performance Mode, Assassin's Creed Shadows on PlayStation 5 Pro features substantial improvements from added specular detail from additional ray tracing. Interestingly enough, the Playstation 5 Pro version also doesn't seem to be using the PSSR upscaler, as it exhibits visual artifacts more in line with analytical upscaling than machine-learning-based upscaling.</p>

<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't push the boundaries of the series' open-world RPG formula first seen in Origins, it delivers solid enhanced by some of the best visuals seen in open-world games that is worth experiencing for all fans of the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025" rel="nofollow">back in August last year</a>, which feels pretty appropriate given that the game's official release date is August 28th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, you'll play as the titular hero as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of his missing mentor Sir Lionstone, the legendary guardian of the land of Clesseia. The Knightling must discover what's happened to Sir Lionstone and save him from whoever has taken him prisoner.</p>

To that end, you'll also be unlocking "the extraordinary powers of Sir Lionstone's mighty shield".</p>

<p>You will, of course, be playing as Sir Lionstone's apprentice, but I'm betting that by the time this one is over, you'll have discovered that even young knightlings can exhibit great courage. That's just a guess, mind.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling</em>'s combat will give you the chance not only to press the attack against your enemies, but also to block and parry attacks in order to create your own openings, finishing the fight with "huge attacks and combos".</p>

<p>The shield isn't just a combat weapon, though; you'll also be using it to solve various puzzles, platform your way across the world, and unlock secrets in order to earn new upgrades.</p>




<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>before you commit to picking it up in August, then there's a free demo for you to try out right now on Steam. Hey, what have you got to lose, eh?</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004254/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on August 28th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/632121/razer-wyvrn-developer-ai-qa-gamer-copilot-sensa-haptics-thx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is getting into AI with a new developer platform called <a href="https://www.wyvrn.com/">Wyvrn</a>. It encompasses dev-focused automation tools like the Razer AI QA Copilot to assist with quality assurance / game testing and the AI Gamer Copilot (formerly called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach">Project Ava</a>) for real-time tips and guides via voice assistant while playing games.</p><p>Wyvrn (pronounced “wyvern,” like the mythical creature) will also be an umbrella for Razer’s next-gen Chroma RGB platform, a new THX Spatial Audio Plus game plug-in, and Razer’s Sensa HD Haptics software.</p><p>The most consequential of Razer’s new tools is the AI QA Copilot. It’s a cloud-based plug-in for Unreal Engine, Unity, and bespoke engines in C++ that’s designed to reduce the time and cost of manual quality assurance testing through AI. Quality assurance is a labor-intensive process for any video game, involving many hours of testing and manually logging glitches in need of fixing. The AI assistant can watch a game being tested, automatically find bugs or performance issues like frame rate drops, and create a QA playtest report with both its findings and any bugs manually tagged by the tester.</p><p>Razer claims that its AI can identify 20 to 25 percent more bugs compared to manual testing, and this can reduce QA time by up to 50 percent as well as cost savings of up to 40 percent. After playtest reports are generated, the AI QA Copilot is designed to learn from the tagged bugs to get “smarter” and more effective.</p><p>What will happen to the employee headcount in QA teams if these tools are introduced and proven successful? It’s perhaps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">not difficult to imagine</a>. And Razer is already partnering with game dev services company <a href="https://www.side.inc/">Side</a> (formerly <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/game-services-firm-ptw-rebrands-as-side/">PTW</a>) to integrate the AI QA Copilot into its in-house QA teams.</p><p>The other big component of Razer’s dabbling in AI is its upcoming and very uniquely named AI Gamer Copilot. It’s an AI-based voice assistant that’s designed to watch you play and give you live, on-the-fly tips for tactics in competitive multiplayer games like MOBAs or strategies on how to take down difficult enemies in single-player games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science">Black Myth: Wukong</a></em>. My colleague Sean Hollister and I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach">saw a brief demo of this at CES</a> while it was called Project Ava, and it seemed… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K46-vHL4Ouo">interesting</a>. The retiring of its “project” moniker means it’s destined for an actual release.</p><p>Razer’s other, non-AI announcements pegged under the Wyvrn platform include its Razer Sensa HD Haptics, which is now getting a sim racing game integration in partnership with <a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/">SimHub</a>. That means users of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/29/24257440/razer-freyja-gaming-cushion-kraken-v4-pro-headphones-haptic-feedback">Freyja haptic chair cushion and Kraken V4 Pro headset</a> can get multidirectional, multidevice haptic feedback in games like <em>Assetto Corsa Evo</em>. Razer claims Sensa haptics are now in over 100 supported titles, with the promise of more to come. And lastly, Razer is introducing a THX Spatial Audio Plus plug-in for Wwise. It’s an open-source format alternative to Dolby and DTS, offering more immersive 3D audio in games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They couldn’t remember who the other two were in their starting six, but said they’d traded them away at some point. With 104 hours logged, the fan still ended up buying <em>Pokémon Ultra Sun</em> after the original copy was lost. </p><p>Now that their original team is back, thanks to the Poké Transporter everyone can safely be transferred to current versions of the game even though the 3DS eShop is long dead. But most players have simply been marveling that the small plastic square held up after all the wear and tear.</p><p>“This happened to me but with<em> Animal Crossing: Wild World</em>,” responded another player. “I must’ve accidentally dropped it outside and after getting a new game I finally found the old one (that went through everything from rain to snow storms!)” Lzzz4 wrote back, “These things are indestructible.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
