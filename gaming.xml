<h2>WWE 2K24 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>WWE 2K24 is a great game to get stuck into if you're looking to participate in some competition against friends and family. Alternatively, there's the career mode, where you work your way up the rankings and become an iconic wrestler of WWE. Compared to previous years, they've made some major improvements and made the game more immersive, allowing for a more realistic experience compared to some of the previous WWE games. Below is an excerpt from Nathan Birch's review.</p>
<p><em>With the release of WWE 2K24, this series no longer feels like a carny outcast amongst the other big sports franchises. While the game’s core action could stand to be even further refined, fun new mechanics, match types, and a fully-developed suite of modes, including significantly improved Showcase and MyGM offerings, are worth cheering for. While maybe not quite the total package just yet, WWE 2K24 feels like it’s ready for the bright lights.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>EA Sports FC 25</h2>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 was one of the most popular sports games to be released this year, according to information from both Circana and Newzoo. Ultimately, it's not too surprising. EA Sports FC is the replacement for the FIFA games and remains just as popular even without the official FIFA license. For a significant amount of time this year, it was one of the top games in the charts. It's the perfect game to be a sweaty gamer in. There were some <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major improvements to the game</a>, such as the introduction of the 5v5 <a href="https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rush mode</a> as well as the addition of being able to play using the women's teams the same way you would utilize the men's teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>F1 24</h2>
<p>Released in May, this is the perfect game for any petrolheads or fans of racing games. Compared to previous games in the franchise, F1 24 is very beginner-friendly and more accessible compared to previous iterations. There is plenty of variety, with 20 drivers and 10 teams to explore, not to mention the ability to <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-career-mode-finally-lets-you-play-as-a-current-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play in the career mode</a> as one of the current superstars. The handling model <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-features-dynamic-handling-the-series-most-comprehensive-physics-update-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a physics update</a>, too. Whether you decide to play and compete online against others or you play solely by yourself against AI in the Driver Career mode, there is a lot of replayability and promise from F1 24.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>EA Sports College Football 25</h2>
<p>One of the other major successful sports games of the year is EA Sports College Football 25. This game took off and was one of the best-sellers on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. Fans who liked the College Football franchise had to wait a whopping 11 years between NCAA Football 14 and EA Sports College Football 25. While the actual football games were a massive part of the game, there were a lot of other features that made it enjoyable, including scheduling visits to colleges, getting to know the recruits, and playing with teams that are less significant than NFL teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>MotoGP 24</h2>
<p>Compared to previous iterations in the MotoGP franchise, this game didn't get a lot of new content or updates that made the game stand out from the crowd. That being said, it's a stunning game and offers the exhilarating experience that fans of this racing franchise are familiar with. While there wasn't much added in particular regarding racing, there were some pretty groundbreaking changes. This includes new transfer markets and being able to adapt the difficulty to your liking.</p>

It’s the notion that there’s only one core route through a game, a pre-determined path down which all players must tread, where we do not have the freedom to pick our own directions. As such, looking back from our current era in which open-world games dominate the AAA landscape, this can give the appearance of a design that removes or restricts player agency to a deletory result.</p><p>And to be incredibly clear, some corridors did just that. While first-person games were born in level-based mazes (<em>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, etc), there did come a wake of games that were almost literal corridors, so ridiculously restrictive that it felt like being dragged down their inevitable tunnel by your nostrils, shoulders scraping the claustrophobic walls all the way. To name names, the very worst of these were the <em>Call of Duty</em> campaigns from <em>Black Ops</em> onward—games that killed you if you dared to walk left or right, rather than straight on, and pushed you to the back to watch the NPCs play the game for you.</p><p>But I would argue that almost no one who played <em>BioShock</em> in 2007 reacted by saying, “Damn, that was just a corridor.” Because it was a game that, despite having only one core pathway, allowed players to feel an enormous sense of freedom. You chose <em>huge</em> amounts in <em>BioShock</em>, from how you actually played (run-and-gun shooter, device-based trapping and stealth, immersive sim), to how you responded to the nature of the world around you, not least in how you treated the Little Sisters. People celebrated the game for the amazing amount of freedom it offered within such a tightly scripted narrative, and all of that is to ignore that the game being a prescribed corridor was <em>the <strong>entire point</strong></em>.</p><p>Sorry to spoil an 18-year-old game, but the fact that you had no choice but to follow the instructions you were given was the massive third-act reveal. That the game was set in an inescapable corridor is so much of why <em>BioShock</em> was brilliant, because if it had let players visit any point in the underwater city of Rapture whenever they wanted, everything else about it would have fallen apart.</p><p><em>BioShock</em>’s drama so often depends on you being exactly where the game designer wants you to be, at exactly the moment they want you there, and that kind of precise narrative choreography is the result of a corridor. By rejecting such game design as a failure, we’re losing this kind of experience, and I really believe it’s something we should instead be fighting to save.</p><figure id="" data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course corridors are, and should be, only a part of games. I’m not silly, I love a fantastic open-world game, and of course have been playing RPGs since the 1980s that offer vast amounts of player freedom when approaching their worlds. I’m not for a moment arguing for anything more than a desire to preserve the corridor as an option among so much else, and therefore not to disparage it as if a failure of the past. Because damn, it brought so much success.</p><p>I don’t think I’m necessarily being that huge of a maverick here. In fact, if you look at any number of “all time best games” lists, and adjust for recency bias, there are certain names that come up again and again: <em>Half-Life 2</em>, <em>Deus Ex</em>, <em>Quake 2</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>. They share space on those lists with games that do quite the opposite, the litany of wonderful RPGs that often eschew corridors entirely, but those games with straight paths undeniably dominate. Indeed, they are the shining examples of how to hide the corridor in the best possible ways.</p><p>But rather than getting into the nitty-gritty of how and why disguising the corridor was key to their success, let’s focus more on what’s being lost without them.</p><p>Open worlds are <em>great</em>, and I’m very happy to be clearing up icons in an Ubisoft map or picking my own unique route through the acts of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. But what they cannot do as well is puppeteer the player, creating deliberate, narrative moments on a deliberate, narrative path. They cannot offer something more akin to the scenes of a movie, where the impact of event B is so much more meaningful because it came directly as a response to the action of event A, and the consequence of this drives the emotional resonance of event C.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I remember, in the early 00s, at the beginning of the rejection of corridor gaming as a design choice, responding with the same argument that springs to mind now: “Do you reject having to read the pages of a book in order? Is the book a failure if page 37 comes after page 36 every time?” To which the immediate counter is, “Games aren’t books, that’s why we call them something else,” and sure, but my point is: games <em>can</em> aim to be like books in some of the best ways. Because, when your game is set in a corridor, when the scenes are as inevitable as the pages of the book, it’s how we interact with them that defines them. It places the emphasis on our own personal interpretation of what we’re offered, and rather than being a sandbox in which we can play god, we’re instead inside a story which we have the means to uniquely experience.</p><p>(In fact, this is the basis for why I’ve argued that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is not a failure to recognize player agency</a></span>, but instead a scripted moment understood uniquely based on your personal experiences accrued across all three games.)</p><p>Agency can be wonderful, but it is often at a cost—the cost of a curated, directed, deliberate narrative experience. And yes, it wouldn’t be a good thing if all games were that, but it’s no better to look down upon it as an anachronistic shortcoming of game design. <em>BioShock</em> only worked <em>because</em> it was a corridor, and indeed was a thesis <em>on the corridor</em>, making it all the more odd of a game to throw under the bus of history. There’s value in experiencing a curated, pre-determined tale, boosted by our unique approaches born of how we turn those pages. I don’t want it to be lost, in the name of boasting “greater player agency.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Counter-Strike 2 came out, it fully replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and introduced a wave of new improvements and changes. While not all the changes have been widely approved by the game’s huge playerbase, CS2 remains the most popular game played on Steam, with no signs of slowing down soon.</p>



<p>But when exactly did the Counter-Strike 2 era begin?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-counter-strike-2-come-out">When Did Counter-Strike 2 Come Out?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 officially came out on September 27, 2023, though the game was playable for some players earlier than that.</p>



<p>CS2 was originally announced back on March 22, 2023, via <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">a series of posts from Val</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">v</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">e</a> highlighting some of the new changes. These changes included the new volumetric and reactive smokes, sub-tick servers, and overhauled or visually updated maps. The game itself also came over to the Source 2 engine.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fresh off the new game announcement, Valve opened a limited test that would offer select players a chance to try out CS2. Less than two months later, in May, Counter-Strike would hit its all-time player peak at 1.8 million players. This can be attributed to the rise in players trying to get CS2 limited test access as well as the release of the Major pass for the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>Finally, on September 27, 2023, CS:GO was officially taken over by Counter-Strike 2. Response to the release was mixed, as gameplay modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone didn’t come over to CS2. Arms Race eventually was released in CS2 in the next year. Valve continues to roll out new updates addressing bugs and major issues while introducing new content.</p>



<p>How do you feel about CS2 since it came out? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

<p>It took just two days before the first layoffs of 2025 took place in the gaming industry. Netmarble F&amp;C is laying off about 20 people — roughly 25% — at the company.</p>



<p>The news was first reported by Korean news outlet <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250102076600017?section=industry/game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YNA</a>.</p>



<p>Netmarble F&amp;C is a subsidiary of the mobile games company Netmarble. The studio is currently working on its new game Demis Reborn, which is scheduled to release sometime in 2025. According to YNA, the game’s “art style and overall atmosphere were significantly revised” in order to better suite adult taste.</p>







<p>It’s also reported that the game’s release date is “likely” to be altered a bit due to the staffing changes.</p>



<p>The last two years have been the worst the games industry has seen when it comes to layoffs. After over 10,000 layoffs in 2023, 2024 <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saw an estimated 16,000+</a> jobs lost. </p>



<p>Do you think 2025 will be better or worse for layoffs in gaming? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

In Rounds 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves.

For a bigger payday, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within. </li><li>Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly.

Sega has been notoriously chill with fans of the Blue Blur using its characters in their own projects, and there are even a handful of community-driven remakes of old games that could use a modern touch-up. The one we’re talking about today is <em>Sonic Galactic</em>, a sidescroller evocative of the series’ 16-bit roots, but made to look like the series might have on the Sega Saturn. The developers over at Starteam have released a new demo, so if you want a look into an alternate universe where Sonic Team got to make a classic <em>Sonic </em>game for the Sega Saturn, you can do that right now.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196572" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Starteam <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sonicgalactic.github.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sonicgalactic.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">describes <em>Sonic Galactic</em></a></span> as “a ‘what-if’ scenario: an imagining of what Sonic Team could have potentially produced” for the Sega Saturn if the system had been more successful and Sega had produced a mainline <em>Sonic </em>game for it. However, the team also notes that it didn’t limit itself to the Saturn’s technical specifications, instead using the hardware and games that were created during the early-‘90s era as inspiration for a <em>Sonic </em>game. As a result, it looks similar to the original sidescrollers and features several returning characters, but you’ll also notice smoother animations and more vibrant scenery.

                <p>Amazon has started canceling preorders for the Nintendo 3DS version of Mighty No. 9, a game that was released almost 10 years ago. Developed by Comcept and former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mighty No. 9 was billed as a spiritual successor to Mega Man.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qsxliyc2vtv2ljcp33e4ta3y?ref_src=embed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky user</a>, Amazon UK sent a notification to them saying that their preorder for Mighty No. 9 on Nintendo 3DS was canceled due to the lack of availability. Surprisingly, this user placed the order in 2022, indicating that people were still able to preorder this version of Mighty No. 9 years after it came out on other platforms.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was funded via Kickstarter and became one of the most infamous funding campaigns in video game history. The 3DS and PS Vita versions were added as stretch goals for the campaign if it hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/27/4777614/mighty-no-9-stretch-goal-ps-vita-3ds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$3.5 million, which it ended up reaching</a>.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was released in <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mighty-no-9/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 for PC, PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One</a>. However, it looks like the 3DS and Vita versions will never come to fruition. Inafune has since moved on to other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-times-new-trailer-shows-off-new-jobs-and-island-customization/1100-6519560/" data-ref-id="1100-6519560">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which is set to release sometime in 2025.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-no-9-review/1900-6416453/" data-ref-id="1900-6416453">Mighty No. 9 review</a>, we said, "For a game that's meant to bear the legacy of a classic series, Mighty No. 9 barely succeeds. It may rouse excitement from time to time, but by and large, it lacks a pervading sense of artistry, both in its level design and presentation."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, Mac, and other Linux-based enjoyers of superhero shooter hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> can once again play without fear of being pulped under an unlawfully swung banhammer. Developers NetEase had recently doled out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">bans of up to 100 years</a> to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-apologizes-for-mistakenly-banning-players-for-using-cheats">IGN</a>, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating," NetEase’s <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1193841000108531764/1201833362399170560/1324661682936746075">Discord</a> statement reads, perhaps not with the kind of wording I’d use if I’d just banned players who are playing fairly and without cheating. It continues: "We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players. We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused."</p>
<p>Proof, there, that justice can be served by apologetic executives just as effectively as vigilante supersoldiers and/or sentient trees. I haven’t played Marvel Rivals – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-review">Ed’s review</a> would have put me off even I hadn’t already had my fill of hero shooters – but I do note that Valve have rated it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/">Playable for the Steam Deck</a>, so the number of falsely condemned SteamOS players could have been substantial from that alone.</p>
<p>Proton, the specific compatibility layer that SteamOS integrates, does have some past form for triggering certain anti-cheat systems, though in the Deck’s early days this was more down to a simple lack of software compatibility rather than genuine concerns over Proton’s potential dodginess. Still, the prospect of exposing games to the untameable, open-source Linux still spooks some developers. Fortnite has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-wont-get-steam-deck-support-epic-ceo-blames-cheaters">never worked on SteamOS</a>, for one, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">cut support</a> over potential cheating concerns.</p>
<p>Fair play to NetEase for refraining from such a heavy handed approach, even if you <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-rivals-winnie-the-pooh-banned">still can't mention Winnie the Pooh</a> in its chat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia is gearing up to announce its next-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, and with it will come the next era of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). According to a leaked store listing, Nvidia DLSS 4 is set to release alongside the new GPUs.</p>



<p>Spotted on social media by <a href="https://x.com/GawroskiT/status/1874834447046168734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomasz Gawroński</a>, a European listing for an Asus RTX 5080 card retailing for €1,699.95 mentions the previously leaked GDDR7 VRAM along with “DLSS4”. While many assumed that the image was fake, noted hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1875039748122878433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kopite7kimi</a> confirmed that DLSS 4 was accurate.</p>



<p>No other details about DLSS 4 were provided. Features along with compatibility for last-gen RTX 40 Series cards should be announced when it’s officially revealed.</p>



<p>Nvidia is scheduled to announce the first RTX 50 Series graphics cards at CES 2025. CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote presentation on January 6 at 930pm ET/ 630pm PT. </p>



<p>You can check out the rumored specs for the first three cards in the next-gen lineup below. It’s worth noting that until details are official, the specs should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

                <p>If you've ever wondered about your skill level in Call of Duty, you now have a way to find out. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have discovered a way to get Activision to provide their previously hidden SBMM ratings, and it's really easy.</p><p>TheXclusiveAce has shared the method on his YouTube channel, which lays out the simple steps to get your personalized SBMM report going back to 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-personnel-problems/1900-6417780/" data-ref-id="1900-6417780">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a>. As noted by TheXclusiveAce, each report includes some highly personal data including your IP address, so think twice before sharing it unedited.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ6Zw8tADVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZ6Zw8tADVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get access, the first step is to visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's privacy page</a> and login to your Activision account. TheXclusiveAce also mentioned that he had to login to his PSN account as well. After that, submit a personal information access request. Prior to the video above, the wait time was around a day before Activision e-mailed the file out. But since this method is now widely known, there may be additional delays.</p><p>The report itself is a very through examination of each player's Call of Duty history, as it tracks every match played, as well as the mode, the operator who was used, the number of hits taken, the longest streak, and more. It's a lot to take in. The report also charts the course of each player's skill ranking as it rises or falls depending upon their activities in the games.</p><p>SBMM ratings are used to place Call of Duty players in lobbies with similarly skilled players, as determined by Activision's criteria. Not every player may agree with these assessments, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-player-pleads-with-call-of-duty-to-put-him-in-the-trash-lobbies/1100-6528596/" data-ref-id="1100-6528596">NBA's Donovan Mitchell recently pleaded with Activision</a> to put him "in the trash lobbies." Over time, it's possible that the most experienced Call of Duty players may be able to utilize the info in their player reports to enhance their ratings.</p><p>Recently, Activision debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">a stoner-lizard DLC</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.

Meanwhile, Treyarch unveiled a collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/" data-ref-id="1100-6528158">Black Ops 6 and Netflix's Squid Game</a>.</p>

            <p>Atari has shared a sneak peek at its upcoming "iconic" handheld console, Gamestation Go.</p>
<p>Whilst the company has given very little in terms of detail, it does reveal the handheld's final look with the accompanying text: "An icon, reimagined".</p>

<p>The teaser shows off the console's button layout, and it all looks very much what you'd expect from a handheld console released in 2025. But it also confirms the system will come with both a paddle and a Trak-Ball, plus a number keypad on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>That's it, though - we don't get a release date or anything else concrete, but with CES 2025 just around the corner commencing 7th January, hopefully we'll discover some of the finer details next week.</p>
<p>On the plus side, we also had a cheeky glimpse of My Arcade, which will hopefully include some Intellivision goodies after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">Atari purchased the brand last year</a>, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest-running console war in history".</p>
<p>Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/falcons-finally-sign-cs2-superstar-niko.1073400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Falcons organization officially announced the signing of Bosnian Counter-Strike superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač today, successfully bringing on the star that once rebuked them. The first significant domino to fall during the latest post-CS2 Major transfer window has fallen. </p>



<p>The plethora of resources available to the Saudi organization have finally led to the star they’ve always wanted, and the move has drastically altered the competitive CS2 landscape.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-second-time-s-the-charm">Second Time’s The Charm</h2>



<p>This is Falcons’ second time going after NiKo, having spent most of 2023 pursuing one of Counter-Strike’s greatest riflers. Though at the end of 2023, NiKo pivoted and chose to remain with G2 Esports for the 2024 season. G2 and NiKo fell just short of winning the Major that still eludes them, but the 2024 campaign was still a successful one. Russian AWP prodigy Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blossomed into one of the best players in the world</a>, and G2 capitalized on the signing of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guatemalan sensation Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</a>. G2 lifted trophies at IEM Dallas, the BLAST Fall Final, and the BLAST World Final in 2024.</p>



<p>Despite the presence of the legendary Emil “Magisk” Reif, Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen, and coach Danny “zonic” Sørensen, it was a turbulent and forgettable 2024 season for Falcons. The roster struggled throughout the year, even with Oleksandr “⁠s1mple⁠” Kostyliev playing with them on loan. The nail in the coffin was failing to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major, prompting Falcons to discontinue s1mple’s loan and bench everyone not named Magisk.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Falcons are <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40627/sources-falcons-in-talks-over-heroic-trio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly considering</a> the trio of Damjan “⁠kyxsan⁠” Stoilkovski, René “⁠TeSeS⁠” Madsen and Abdul “⁠degster⁠” Gasanov, who all currently play for Danish organization Heroic. But this is the result of another instance in which Falcons have been denied the player they really want, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G2 has reportedly closed off talks for previously mentioned m0NESY</a>.</p>



<p>With the big NiKo domino now fallen, and the post-Major break ending in less than two weeks, many more new signings and transfers are expected over the next few days. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Looks Like a Bunch More GameStop Stores are Closing Down]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-a-bunch-more-gamestop-stores-are-closing-down.1073379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several more GameStop stores appear to be closing down, although there's technically been no real official announcement from the company or its management regarding these closures (save for one small detail in an SEC filing).</p>

<p>Over on the GameStop subreddit, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hsbjt5/my_first_thought_when_i_heard_my_store_was_closing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">number</a> of GameStop <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs3a1i/well_guys_its_been_nice/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">employees</a>&nbsp;are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs7n3n/my_store_has_been_culled/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declaring</a> that their stores are being closed. Sorting posts by most recent on the subreddit shows tons of posts pertaining to store closures, although the posts don't name which stores are closing.</p>

<p>That might be owing to the policy outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs5bok/to_our_concerned_guests_do_not_ask/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> by GameStop assistant store leader ArcherFawkes, who claims that if employees share information about a store's closure with customers, they'll be punished. As such, users are directed not to "ask for what stores are closing", as they "cannot tell you outright".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-reddit.jpg?itok=tW-laThn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-reddit.jpg?itok=sThjS2CD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GameStop subreddit is currently full of posts declaring that stores are closing down.</figcaption></figure><p>The full scale of the store closures isn't currently known, and it is possible that some of these posts are by users who work at the same GameStop, but it seems that plenty of stores have been affected.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, GameStop management hasn't made an official public-facing announcement of these closures, although in an <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/2c1eac18-9f79-41b9-9e56-a8db8fe7aac4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEC filing from mid-S</a><a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/20696/html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eptember</a>, company management said an ongoing review "may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years".</p>

<p>These closures come after GameStop announced back in March <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that it had closed 287 stores</a> over the previous fiscal year, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-closing-180-200-stores" rel="nofollow">hundreds</a> of other store closures in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previous years</a>.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-discloses-third-quarter-2024-results" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earnings release</a>, GameStop acknowledges that its net sales have dropped from $1.078 billion in last year's third quarter to just $860m in the same period this fiscal year, although net income for the third quarter was $17.5 million, up from a $3.1 million loss during the same period last year.</p>

<p>The situation eventually got so out of hand that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/white-house-economic-team-monitoring-gamestop-stock-situation" rel="nofollow">attracted the US government's attention</a>. Eventually, author Ben Mezrich would write a book,&nbsp;<em>The Antisocial Network</em>, chronicling the debacle, with that book later becoming a major Hollywood motion picture by the name of&nbsp;<em>Dumb Money</em>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming weeks with regards to GameStop store closures, but for now, if you're a company employee, it might be best to check with your management regarding what's going on with your store.</p>

                <p>Marvel Rivals developer NetEase has apologized to rightfully pissed-off players who were unfairly banned for cheating. The problem is even though they were not using cheating software, this resulted in false bans. NetEase failed to say how many.</p><p>NetEase said (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-apologizes-for-mistakenly-banning-players-for-using-cheats" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) that it admitted it had mistakenly flagged some players who were playing in compatibility layer programs as cheaters. "We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating," NetEase said. "We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players. We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused."</p><p>NetEase continued that it is investing in improving its anti-cheat, and called on players to report cheaters if they encounter them.</p><p>"Our mission is to provide all players with a fair, just, and enjoyable gaming environment. Therefore, preventing and identifying cheaters is one of our top priorities. We have invested significant manpower and resources to improve the speed and accuracy of our detection systems," the developers added. "With any ongoing detection system, there is always room for improvement. We appreciate your assistance in helping us tackle this challenge. If you encounter any cheating behavior, please report it immediately; our reporting system will respond promptly. If you believe you have been wrongly banned, you can appeal to our customer support team, and we will review your case and respond in a timely manner. You can reach the support team via either in-game or in Discord!"</p><p>The news comes ahead of Marvel Rivals Season 1 and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">arrival of Fantastic Four playable characters</a> who were teased with a first-look image with a soon-to-be-released trailer. Fingers crossed for HERBIE to be added as well.</p><p>While this might have annoyed some players, Marvel Rivals has been a stellar hit for NetEase, reporting 10 million players in three days <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">and 20 million in two weeks</a>. Over on Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-dc-in-2025.1073340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-dc-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the comics, 2024 was a pretty quiet year for DC. It didn’t help that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-2-suffers-a-historic-drop-at-the-box-office-as-another-clown-takes-the-top-spot">Joker: Folie à Deux turned out to be one of the year’s biggest box office bombs</a>. But there’s a new hope on the horizon. James Gunn’s DCU is coming, and with it a brand new era for DC on the big and small screens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From Gunn’s hotly anticipated Superman movie to the return of shows like Peacemaker and The Sandman to the expansion of DC’s Absolute Universe, let’s break down the biggest and most important DC projects arriving in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman Kicks Off the Live-Action DCU</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to 2023, which saw the release of no fewer than four films set in the now-defunct DC Extended Universe, 2025 is definitely smaller in scope. Just like with 2024’s Joker: Folie à Deux, there’s only one new live-action DC movie hitting theaters this year. That said, it’s easily the most important movie DC has released in years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That movie is, of course, James Gunn’s Superman. Where Gunn’s Creature Commandos animated series gave us our first taste of the new DCU cinematic universe, Superman is our first live-action foray into this world. Based on Creature Commandos’ quality, not to mention Gunn’s work on the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, we have high hopes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman casts David Corenswet as the Man of Steel. Rather than exploring Kal-El’s origin story for the umpteenth time, the movie takes place after Superman has been on the job for a few years. He’s trying his best to use his powers to guide and protect mankind and prove that there’s room for decency and kindness in our cynical modern world. In other words, exactly the sort of superhero film we could all use right about now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman also stars Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, and Wendell Pierce as Perry White. And because this film is our introduction to the DCU in live-action, fans can expect a lot of other DC heroes to drop by. That lineup includes Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Guy Gardner, Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, and Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho. Also helping tie together the growing DCU will be Frank Grillo, who reprises the role of Rick Flag, Sr. from Creature Commandos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Needless to say, there’s a lot riding on Superman’s brawny shoulders right now. This film marks the full debut of a brand-new cinematic universe, and it paves the way for a number of big-budget DC projects in the years ahead, from movies like Supergirl and The Authority to shows like Lanterns and Paradise Lost. It’s a piece in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dcu-chapter-one-gods-and-monsters-james-gunn-peter-safran">a much larger puzzle Gunn is calling “Gods and Monsters.”</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is whether Superman can succeed where so many DC movies have crashed and burned in recent years. Given the way films like The Flash and Shazam! Fury of the Gods bombed at the box office in 2023, it’s clear fans had written off the old DCEU before it even finished. And Joker: Folie à Deux proved to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-2-should-be-a-big-deal-for-dc-so-why-does-it-seem-like-nobody-cares">a complete misfire for DC in 2024</a>. Is the DC brand irrevocably tarnished in Hollywood, or can Superman start the road to recovery?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever happens, we’re eagerly looking forward to the release of Superman, which hits theaters on July 11, 2025.      </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Batman: Knightfall Gets Animated</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman may be the only live-action theatrical release DC is putting out in 2025, but it won’t be the only new DC movie. DC’s line of direct-to-DVD animated films will continue in the new year, with details starting to leak about their ambitious next project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of the critically acclaimed two-part Watchmen adaptation, DC is turning to another classic graphic novel for its next adaptation, Batman: Knightfall. In fact, Knightfall is reportedly getting a full trilogy of adaptations, matching the scope of the recent Crisis on Infinite Earths movie trilogy. The trilogy hasn’t been officially announced yet, but as pointed out by The Direct, <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/warner-bros-developing-new-batman-movie-trilogy-report" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a listing for the first movie has appeared on the EIDR database</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Batman: Knightfall is the famous 1993 crossover where Batman first encountered the ruthless Bane. Over the course of the story, Bane wears down the Dark Knight physically and psychologically and breaks his back. Left paralyzed, Bruce has no option but to turn the Batman mantle over to another like-minded vigilante named Jean-Paul Valley. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Batman: Knightfall is a trilogy of movies, we assume the first film will adapt Knightfall itself, while the second will cover the follow-up crossover Knightquest and the third will cap off the story by adapting Knightsend. In Knightquest, Jean-Paul establishes himself as a more ruthless and deranged alternative to Bruce, while in Knightsend a recovered Bruce has to reclaim the Batman mantle and save Gotham City from this sadistic new Dark Knight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, DC has yet to formally announce the Batman: Knightfall movies, so at this stage we don’t know the voice cast or potential release dates. It’s possible that Knightfall is a continuation of the Tomorrowverse, meaning that Batman: The Long Halloween star Jensen Ackles would reprise the Batman role again. But it’s also possible that DC has closed the door on that animated universe following the Crisis trilogy, meaning we may see a new actor cast as Batman. Either way, expect Batman: Knightfall to be one of the darkest and most violent Batman movies since DC’s adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC TV in 2024</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There may be only one new DC movie hitting theaters in 2025, but DC definitely has a more stacked TV and streaming lineup planned this year. That includes another addition to the new but rapidly growing DCU, as Gunn’s Peacemaker returns for Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Peacemaker: Season 2 will be the next DCU project to hit after Superman. How does that work when the first season was a spinoff of Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, which was part of the DCEU? Don’t think too hard about it. Just know that Season 2 continues the misadventures of John Cena’s peace-loving anti-hero Christopher Smith. Danielle Brooks, Freddie Stroma, Jennifer Holland, Steve Agee, and Robert Patrick are all also returning for Season 2, and Frank Grillo’s Rick Flag Sr. continues to serve as the glue tying the DCU together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Peacemaker Season 2 will debut on Max in August 2025, so fans don’t have to wait long after Superman’s release to get more of this growing superhero universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re expecting one other live-action DC series to arrive in 2025, as Netflix finally continues the saga of The Sandman. Tom Sturridge is back as Morpheus, as the Lord of Dreams deals with new challenges to his realm. One of those challenges comes from Gwendoline Christie’s Lucifer, who is out for revenge after being outwitted by Morpheus in Season 1. It’s expected that Season 2 will adapt the comic storyline The Season of Mists, a tale that pushes the Morpheus/Lucifer rivalry in a very unexpected direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can also expect to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-price-actor-barry-sloane-is-the-prodigal-in-the-sandman-season-2">meet the rest of Morpheus’ siblings in Season 2</a>, including Adrian Lester’s Destiny, Esmé Creed-Miles’ Delirium, and Barry Sloane’s Destruction. Why did Morpheus’ little brother Destruction abdicate his responsibilities? That’s another mystery the series looks poised to explore in Season 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With production on Season 2 having wrapped in 2024, Netfix has previously confirmed a 2025 release for Season 2. However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-gaiman-offering-to-step-back-from-good-omens-season-3-amid-assault-allegations-report">executive producer Neil Gaiman was recently accused of sexual assault and abuse</a> by multiple women, and it’s unclear how this might affect Netflix’s timetable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the animated side of things, we’re hoping to see new seasons of Batman: Caped Crusader, My Adventures With Superman, and Harley Quinn in 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Caped Crusader debuted on Prime Video in 2024, at which point Amazon had already greenlit the series for a second season. Hamish Linklater will return as the voice of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Based on the ending to Season 1, it seems safe to assume that Season 2 will deal with the emergence of Batman’s greatest foe, the Joker, though we don’t yet know who will voice the Clown Prince of Crime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for My Adventures With Superman, this lighthearted, shonen anime-inspired series has been greenlit for Season 3. With Season 1 debuting in 2023 and Season 2 following in 2024, we’re hopeful that the third season can continue that annual release schedule, especially with the new movie also dropping this year. With Season 2 introducing Supergirl and pitting Superman against Amanda Waller and ARGUS, it’s anyone’s guess what parts of the Superman mythos Season 3 will mine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Harley Quinn is confirmed to return in January 2025. This decidedly adults-only animated series took a year off in 2024 to make room for the Kite-Man spinoff, but it’s time to put the spotlight back on Kaley Cuoco’s Harley and Lake Bell’s Poison Ivy.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC Games: Will We See a New Arkham Game?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 is looking to be pretty quiet on the gaming front for DC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deathstroke-rounds-out-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-currently-announced-roadmap-but-then-what">Rocksteady will be adding Deathstroke</a> as the newest and last playable character to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. After a rough launch in 2024, that live-service game looks to be headed into maintenance mode in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We could see new DC characters added to the free-to-play fighting game MultiVersus, which already includes mainstays Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Joker, and Harley Quinn. And it’s also possible the Meta Quest-exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow will be ported to other VR systems in 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But beyond that, there’s not much for DC fans to look forward to in 2025. At best, we hope to see some concrete announcements about what’s coming in terms of DC’s video game roadmap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know there are projects in the works. While Gunn has already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunn-throws-cold-water-on-the-batman-video-game-rumor">shot down rumors of a new game set in Matt Reeves’ The Batman universe</a>, there is at least one new Batman game in development right now. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav confirmed as much when he revealed on a recent investor call that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady">Batman is one of the core pillars of the company’s gaming future</a> going forward. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Rocksteady be working on the next entry in the Arkham franchise? Or will another studio take charge of putting players in Batman’s boots? Either way, we’re hoping to catch a glimpse of this mysterious game at some point in 2025. And while we’re at it, it would be nice to see a little more of Monolith’s Wonder Woman game, which was announced at the 2021 Game Awards but has basically dropped off the map since.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC Comics Goes All In</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">DC may have had a rough year on the big screen in 2024, but DC Comics is coming off a very successful year and looking to continue that momentum into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DC’s main focus right now is on the DC All In initiative, which aims to give readers fresh, easy jumping-on points for all of DC’s ongoing titles. That includes major books like Tom King and Daniel Sampere’s Wonder Woman, Joshua Williamson and Dan Mora’s Superman, Tom Taylor and Mikel Janin’s Detective Comics, and Mark Waid and Dan Mora’s Justice League Unlimited. We’re also eagerly looking forward to digging into Ram V and Evan Cagle’s New Gods, a series that just kicked off in December 2024 and will be as important as any other when it comes to charting the Darkseid-focused future of the DC line.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC's Absolute Universe: Preview Art Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dc-comics-absolute-universe-batman-scott-snyder">Then there’s the Absolute Universe</a>, the other side of the DC All In coin. The Absolute line is similar to Marvel’s Ultimate Universe in that it focuses on updating and streamlining DC’s iconic heroes without the burden of decades of existing continuity. Scott Snyder and Nick Dragotta’s Absolute Batman, Kelly Thompson and Hayden Sherman’s Absolute Wonder Woman, and Jason Aaron and Rafa Sandoval’s Absolute Superman have all proven to be big hits for DC, and they’ll continue to expand the line heading into 2025. Look for new additions like Al Ewing and Jahnoy Lindsay’s Absolute Green Lantern, Jeff Lemire and Nick Robles’ Absolute Flash and Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez’s Absolute Martian Manhunter, all debuting in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DC’s biggest story of the year, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dc-comics-announces-batman-hush-sequel-and-the-return-of-vertigo-nycc-2024">may well be Batman: Hush 2</a>. This sequel brings back writer Jeph Loeb and artist Jim Lee for a brand-new mystery centered around the titular villain. Hush 2 kicks off in the pages of Batman #158, also releasing in March.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/20/mixcollage-20-oct-2024-12-06-am-1693-1729397202902.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, DC is bringing back the beloved Vertigo imprint in 2025. Once the home of critically acclaimed mature readers comics like The Sandman, Preacher, and Y: The Last Man, Vertigo was previously shuttered back in 2019. But now it’s returning as a home for creator-owned comics. James Tynion and Álvaro Martínez Bueno's The Nice House by the Sea is the first book to carry the Vertigo banner, but we’re expecting a lot more announcements in the months to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s what you can expect from DC in 2025. Are you excited for Gunn’s Superman? What about the return of Peacemaker and The Sandman? Cast your vote in our poll and let us know in the comments which new DC project you’re most looking forward to this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enterprising&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>players have figured out a way to discover their SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) rating within the game, a value that's supposed to be hidden from players' view.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-are-getting-activision-to-send-them-their-personal-information-so-they-can-find-out-their-hidden-sbmm-rating" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, this method comes via YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, and it works for every&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game you've played since 2021's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>. That's a heck of a lot of data.</p>

<p>As IGN points out, however, it's a method that takes a little while, and you'll have to put in a bit of effort to reap the rewards. You'll have to submit a personal information access request via the <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Activision privacy page</a>, and it can take a couple of days for the data to arrive, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=2Vil6up- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=u5uyfZJv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to find out your&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>SBMM rating? You can do so via a newly-discovered method.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you do get the info (for which you'll also need to log into an Activision account), you'll be granted access to a vast amount of data that, according to IGN and TheXclusiveAce, includes every Multiplayer match you've played on record.</p>

<p>You can see info like the modes and maps you've played with, as well as number of hits, damage numbers, and even the amount of time you've spent moving in each game. Activision really is collecting a staggering amount of player data from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, it seems.</p>

<p>If you don't know what SBMM is, it's a rather hot topic within the multiplayer gaming world. SBMM, or skill-based matchmaking, refers to a method by which players are grouped together in multiplayer games according to their skill level.</p>

<p>Some players have decried SBMM, suggesting it makes games too hard to enjoy as "sweaty" players dominate higher-end lobbies. However, <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extensive experiments released by Activision last year</a> seem to contradict this, suggesting that players do appreciate SBMM when it's present, even if they don't realize it.</p>

<p>However, if the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>community comes together to compare data, then a more comprehensive picture of the way SBMM works within the games could be created.</p>

<p>It's well worth watching his video on the subject if you want to learn more about how to access your own data, as well as what it could tell you about your own&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>performance. You can see it here.</p>




<h2>What else is going on in the world of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>?</h2>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>land, the games'&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>collaboration, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow">first teased back in early December</a>, has now officially landed.</p>

<p>Per the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>blog, the&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover gives you the chance to earn goodies like a new Front Man Operator, as well as new Skins for existing Operators that sport the iconic green tracksuit from the show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-free-weekend-severance-silo-for-all-mankind-1851731841<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple TV+ is a strange ol’ streaming service, spending wads of Apple’s infinite money on incredibly expensive prestige television and movies, and then hiding it all as best it could. In recent months, it’s occurred to the company that perhaps it’d be good if people saw the stuff it’s making, adding the service as an option on Amazon Prime, and now it’s offering a completely free weekend to lure you in. It’s just, there’s also an awful lot of confusion about when it actually starts.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s purportedly not set up such that you have to cancel once the free weekend is over on January 5, which is good. I say purportedly, because right now we’re unable to get it to offer anything other than the standard seven-day free trial, which <em>does</em> require you to cancel. It’s also worth noting that on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/12/get-a-free-all-access-pass-to-apple-tv-the-first-weekend-of-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/12/get-a-free-all-access-pass-to-apple-tv-the-first-weekend-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s own press release for the offer</a></span>, it describes it as running January 3 to 5, but the embedded video says it’s January 4 to 5. We contacted Apple to get some clarification, and it didn’t clear things up a great deal. It’s expected to start at some point in the evening in ET zones, but perhaps earlier in PT, and then beyond that, “the timing just depends on the territory.”</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808"><em>Severance</em>’s Most Complicated Relationship Gets Messier In Season 2</a></span></p><p>If you <em>can</em> get it working, there’s a wealth of excellent stuff to watch on the streamer, genuinely some of the best TV in the last few years.

Then there’s <em>For All Mankind</em>, a wonderful alternative-timeline historical drama set in a version of the world where Russia beat America to landing on the moon, and the consequential space race. Both are gripping dramas.</p><p>Then there’s <em>Severance</em>, Ben Stiller and Adam Scott’s incredible twist on a workplace comedy in which everything is distinctly not OK, Bill “<em>Scrubs</em>” Lawrence’s comedy <em>Ted Lasso</em> following an American coach of a British football team, and indeed Bill Lawrence’s comedy-drama-cum-murder mystery <em>Bad Monkey</em>, with Vince Vaughn finally finding a platform in which he can shine.</p><p>There’s a ton of other sci-fi on there too, among it <em>Invasion</em>, <em>Dark Matter</em>, <em>Foundation</em>, <em>Constellation</em>, and the <em>Godzilla</em> spin-off show <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.</em> Other hugely rated shows include <em>Slow Horses </em>starring Gary Oldman, <em>Bad Sisters </em>with the amazing Sharon Horgan, and <em>Disclaimer </em>starring Cate Blanchett.</p><p>A <em>lot</em> of the above shows have been cancelled, so cruel is the world of spending hundreds of millions on TV shows that don’t ever get a chance to find an audience, but none so brutally as Taika Waititi’s reimagining of Terry Gilliam’s <em>Time Bandits</em>. But, you know, if you’re only planning to blitz the archive for a single weekend, you may as well watch what looks enjoyable.</p><p>Um, Apple has also made some movies.</p><p>Is there a catch? Well, sure. You’ll need to sign up for an Apple ID to do this, which is to say, this is a massive database play by the megacorp, looking to gather vast numbers of email addresses to bombard with further nags. But of course it’s that, and we’re all capable of unsubscribing, or using a temporary email address.</p><p>Whether it actually starts Friday or Saturday (we shall update accordingly), it seems like a pretty decent deal. If you want <em>one</em> show to focus on, pick <em>Silo. </em>And <em>Severance</em>. And <em>For All Mankind.</em></p><p><strong>Updated: 01/03/2025, 10:32 a.m. ET:</strong> Added some vague details about when the offer begins in the U.S. based on Apple’s response to our questions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>According to a veteran video game industry analyst, 2025 could be the year that Microsoft goes "all-in" on bringing its Xbox games to other platforms, including PlayStation 5. Microsoft, of course, has already begun to launch some games on rival platforms, but Serkan Toto of Kantan Games believes Microsoft will lean further into that this year.</p><p>Toto told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-finally-gta-6-to-dominate-ai-in-game-dev-again-analysts-predictions-for-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft may opt to do this for a variety of reasons, including helping to pay for its massive buyout of Activision Blizzard and the "huge lead" of PlayStation in the market.</p><p>"2025 might be the year where they go all-in," Toto said. "The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs across the board, the power of forever-titles, the huge lead of Sony, and other factors will likely leave Microsoft no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early, including blockbusters such as Gears of War: E-Day or Perfect Dark."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="495614030" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

including Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Hi-Fi Rush, and Pentiment. Even before this, though, Microsoft was already one of the biggest publishers on PlayStation and Switch thanks to the juggernaut Minecraft series. Call of Duty is now a Microsoft franchise, too, and Microsoft continues to release the game on PlayStation platforms.</p><p>One of the next big Xbox games to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches for PS5 in Spring 2025. Beyond this, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">ongoing rumors of a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster project that could launch on PS5.</a></p><p>In May, it was reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">mandating increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox</a>. At the time, it was reported that Microsoft might look to release even more of its first-party games on PlayStation to help increase revenue. There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.</p>
