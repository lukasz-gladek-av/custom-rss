            <p>Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki "Youshi P" Yoshida offered his "sincere apologies" for "issues" identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published on the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/09598d1b4efffdc7cdc3360d32bf2086026761b6">official website</a>, Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed an issue in the Xbox version where the game client may become unresponsive when transitioning between locations, such as field areas and cities," Yoshida explained. "Our preliminary investigation suggests that this issue is likely due to a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation.</p>
<p>"We are currently conducting a comprehensive investigation into the matter, which we have prioritised to ensure a swift resolution. However, rectifying this issue requires the deployment of a patch to update the client. This process involves rigorous checks by our QA team, among other procedures, which means it may take several days to address."</p>
<p>Yoshida said that the team was working to expedite a patch to address this, but as "this process will take some time", he "apologised for the inconvenience caused".</p>
<p>Similarly, issues in the Dragonsong’s Reprise (Ultimate), the Minstrel’s Ballad: Shinryu’s Domain, and Delubrum Reginae (Savage) where "mechanics related to freezing are not functioning correctly" will be resolved via a "client patch", although it's not yet clear when that will be deployed.</p>
<p>"The aforementioned issues are being classified as a high priority," Yoshida added. "They are under investigation on our development server and are being addressed in a systematic manner. We are considering the release of a hot fix, which is likely to occur sometime this week, which would be accompanied by a brief maintenance period.</p>
<p>"I would like to extend my apologies once again for the occurrence of these issues. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing issues such as these that occur after the release of an expansion and will continue to promptly correct any urgent issues that may arise."</p>
<p>"So far, Tural's environments feel rich and warm, existing in a perpetual summer haze," Ed wrote in his wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail preview</a>. </p>
<p>"Zoom in close, though, and the real difference from the graphical update is apparent. The texture work on armour and weapons is a vast improvement, while animal races - like the new female Hrothgar - seem more realistically furry."</p>
<p>In 2015, the MMO had four million players for the Heavensward expansion; this has grown to 30 million registered accounts by 2024's Tokyo Fan Fest. Even by 2021 it had become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">the most profitable game in the long-running series</a> and that will only have increased since, not to mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-purchases-on-xbox-require-an-extra-currency">game's release this year on Xbox</a> and the likely boost to sales Dawntrail will provide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-no-chance-of-final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-launch-server-woes-naoki-yoshida-says-after-endwalker-issues">Yoshida told Eurogamer there's "almost no chance" of server woes at launch</a>" when the expansion goes live on 2nd July, 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-to-shutdown-in-june-private-server-version-incoming">Velan Studios may have shuttered its competitive "dodgebrawl" game, Knockout City, a year ago</a>, but it still "loves that world and can't imagine not going back to it at some point".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.velanstudios.com/post/a-big-week">update</a> primarily focussed on the reveal of Midnight Murder Club – described as a blend of "hide-and-seek in the dark with shooter gameplay to make a truly thrilling playground" – and new VR pinball game Bounce Arcade, Velan founders Karthik and Guha Bala insisted they still "love Knockout City as much as you do and want to bring it back".</p>

<p>"We know that some of you are waiting for Knockout City to return and are disappointed that we didn’t announce any news about that this week," the brothers said.</p>
<p>"As an indie studio, we love our ability to lean into ideas that excite us, and rest assured we love [Knockout] City as much as you do and want to bring it back, *just not yet*.</p>
<p>"We spent over four years crafting Knockout City the first time around, and we don’t want to rush the process for the next game in that universe," the statement continued. "We love that world and can’t imagine not going back to it at some point, when the time is right."</p>
<p>Knockout City, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-has-officially-gone-free-to-play">free-to-play</a> "dodgebrawl" game, shutdown in June 2024.</p>
<p>"This was an extremely difficult decision for us, but a necessary and important one for our studio," game director at developer Velan Studios, Jeremy Russo, said at the time.</p>
<p>It was initially published on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC last May under the EA Originals label, but Velan announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-published-knockout-city-going-free-to-play-this-spring-without-ea">assume publishing duties</a> and shift to a free-to-play model just a few months after it launched.</p>

            <p>Steam users have collectively amassed £14bn ($19bn) worth of unplayed games.</p>
<p>That's according to new research from <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/pile-of-shame">PCGN</a> and SteamIDFinder, which has put the full cost of the number of unplayed games sitting in our Steam libraries as "about the same as the gross domestic product of Nicaragua".</p>

<p>Admittedly, the research hasn't polled every single one of the millions of us who have a Steam account, but the numbers were calcuated by anaylsing the 73m  accounts in the SteamIDFinder database that are set to public.</p>
<p>By using the data from those public accounts, the research opines we've spent £1.4bn on games we haven't played even once. Presuming that figure is representative of all Steam accounts, scale that figure up and it's estimated that across the whole Steam user community, that equates to a staggering £14bn of unplayed games.</p>
<p>If you want to know exactly how much cash is tied up in your pile of shame, head on over to <a href="https://www.steamidfinder.com/#pileofshame">SteamIDFinder</a>.</p>
<p>Valve recently revealed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-launches-new-background-gameplay-recording-and-sharing-feature-into-beta">expanding Steam's already teetering tower of built-in features with a new background gameplay recording and sharing system</a> that's available in beta now.</p>
<p>As detailed on Valve's Game Recording beta page, Steam's new suite of console-like video features begin with two distinct recording modes. A Background Recording mode continuously saves gameplay to a preferred drive - users can set duration and storage limits - while an On Demand Recording mode enables users to start and stop recording as they choose.</p>
<p>A new timeline feature and player-added event markers are intended to make it easier to find key moments (achievements, screenshots, and in-game events in supported games can also auto-generate markers if desired) and recordings can be clipped using new "lightweight" tools.</p>

			<p>Saber Interactive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4225021101189985804?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a community update about its upcoming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-gets-6-minute-gameplay-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2</a>. First and foremost, the studio informed fans that the previously announced online beta will no longer take place.</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2 is almost ready. We are now entirely focused on optimization, polish and fixing remaining issues ahead of launch on September 9. This means we will not run a public online beta, as it would take the development teams away from preparing for the full launch, and our priority is to ensure the best possible experience at release.</em></p>
<p><em>We know this is disappointing news for some of you. As a thank you to those interested in participating, players who registered via the online signup before June 28, 2024, midnight Paris Time, will receive the limited Bolt Pistol skin.</em></p>
<p>The development team also recapped the main modes available in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, revealing that the campaign is around 12 hours long. Playable either solo or in co-op, it features Lieutenant Titus fighting alongside his Battle-Brothers Chairon and Gadriel against swarms of Tyranids and Chaos.</p>
<p>In the co-op Operations mode, players may also play solo or with two friends in an endlessly replayable PvE action where they face swarms of Tyranids on six different maps to defend the Imperium. Finally, in the PvP Eternal War mode, players will fight in 6v6 matches in three different classic game modes: Annihilation, Seize Ground, Capture &amp; Control).</p>
<ul>
<li>Annihilation is a Team Deathmatch mode in which two teams compete against each other. Each takedown earns your team 1 point. The first team to reach 50 points wins the match.</li>
<li>Seize Ground is a Domination mode where two teams compete to keep control of one zone that’s moving throughout the match. Keeping control of the zone grants your team points. The winner is the team that reaches the total amount of points given.</li>
<li>Capture &amp; Control is a King of the Hill mode with three specific zones in the arena. Each team fights to control them. Gaining and keeping control of a zone grants your team points. Be the first to obtain a certain amount of points to win the match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saber also confirmed that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will run its online modes on dedicated servers across the North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Oceania regions, allowing for optimal multiplayer experiences. Ahead of the game's launch in early September, eager fans across North America can get their hands on a game demo at expos in Denver (July 4-7), Indianapolis (August 1-4), Chicago (August 16-18), and Toronto (August 22-25).</p>

<p>A remake of <em>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</em> launched this week, made by the original game's developers. It strikes a fascinating balance between re-creation and reinvention, and based on a couple of hours of playing it, it's a resounding success.</p>
<p><em>Myst</em> was the classic most people remembered fondly from the early CD-ROM era, but for me, its sequel, <em>Riven</em>, was the highlight. After that, the sequels declined in quality. The sophomore effort was the apex.</p>
<p>It was certainly more ambitious than <em>Myst</em>. Instead of a handful of tightly packed theme park worlds, it offered a singular, cohesive one that felt lived in and steeped in history in a way that <em>Myst</em> couldn't quite match.</p>
<h2>A worthy presentation</h2>
<p>That was thanks to outstanding art direction but also to its iconic musical score.</p>
<p>For the most part, the remake nails both of those things. While the original game resembled the first <em>Myst</em> in that you had to click to scroll between static images to explore the game's world, the new one follows the 2020<em> Myst</em> remake (and 2000's oft-forgotten <em>realMyst</em>) in giving the player full movement, akin to contemporary first-person puzzle games like <em>Portal</em>, <em>The Witness</em>, or <em>The Talos Principle</em>. Since it's easy to re-create a lot of the original camera angles this way, it might have been cool if there had been an option to control the game as you did originally, but I can see why that wasn't a priority.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Riven-room.png" data-height="1440" data-width="2560" alt="The environments are just as atmospheric and detailed as they used to be."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Riven-room.png" data-height="1440" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The environments are just as atmospheric and detailed as they used to be.</p><p>Samuel Axon</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It just so happens that today's graphics hardware does an outstanding job of replicating previously static visuals in full 3D. (There's even VR support, though I haven't tried it yet.) And the music is just as good as it used to be.
</p><p>There are only two downsides on the presentation front. First, I've heard that folks running on older machines may struggle to achieve satisfactory fidelity and performance. I played it on both an M1 Max MacBook Pro and a Windows 11 desktop with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. The MacBook Pro ran the game at maxed-out settings at the laptop's native resolution at around 30 frames per second. The desktop did the same at 4K at 120 fps. But those are both high-end, recent-ish machines, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Second, the full-motion video performances in the original game have been replaced with full 3D, video game-looking characters. It's a necessary concession, but I feel some of the character was lost. They did a pretty good job matching the motions of the original videos, though.</p>

		<p>We’ve got a great summer of gaming coming up with 2024 seemingly keen on keeping us inside rather than letting us damage our skin in the sun that we’re not getting. Flintlock: Siege of Dawn is one of the more promising of those titles we’ve got coming up, with it set to release on July 18th for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. While console players won’t be remotely concerned, those on the PC side of the fence will likely want to know whether their rig meets the minimum specifications, or whether a trip to the graphics card shop might be in order.</p>

			<p>PlayStation's Returnal studio, Housemarque, is looking for a Senior Game Designer for its next AAA action title.</p>
<p>The Finish Studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-returnal-has-officially-joined-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became part of PlayStation Studios in 2021</a> shortly after the successful release of Returnal. Last year, the roguelike third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/returnal-pc-launch-weak-peak-concurrent-10th-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also made its way to PC</a>. It's been three years since the global launch of Returnal, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-game-designer-at-housemarque-3962842467/?originalSubdomain=fi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as spotted</a> on Linkedin, the PlayStation-owned studio is now hiring for its next "big" game. Although the job ad doesn't necessarily include details about the studio's next title, it mentions that the game designer will focus on enemy and boss design.</p>
<p>"If you wish to join us for our next journey, apply today!", the ad reads. "We are looking for a Senior Game Designer focusing on Enemy and Boss design for our next big game!"</p>
<p>Other interesting tidbits from the job offer include a "passion for action games" as well as "enemy and boss design". In addition, the offer mentions "proficient in the use of Unreal Engine". We've covered a screenshot of the job offer below.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Housemarque is hiring for its next "big" AAA action game</figcaption></figure>
<p>As covered back in 2022, we know that Housemarque is <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-is-working-on-a-new-ip-after-returnal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working on a new IP for PlayStation</a>. "We had our stint working on multiplayer games because a few years back it seemed like you needed to have some kind of multiplayer experience". Housemarque's Managing Director Ilari Kuittinen said in 2022. "We tried that, and we really didn’t do it as well. But it’s early days with us starting a new game, a new IP, concepting it out. We’ll see what comes with that."</p>
<p>Further details about Housemarque's new project are unknown, but from the looks of it, we're looking at a new AAA action title. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the studio's upcoming new project.</p>
<p>Returnal was released for PlayStation 5 in 2021 with a PC version being released in 2023. Here's what we wrote about the PS5 version in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again."</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-player-count-soar/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld%E2%80%99s-player-count-soars-by-700-following-new-update.915456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-player-count-soar/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Palworld’s latest update has added a new island – Sakurajima – along with a series of new Pals, enemies, and items. It’s the most sizeable update the game has received since being released in January 2024, and it has caused a surge in popularity, with player counts booming across all platforms.</p>



<p>Using Steam as a representative example, we can confirm that Palworld’s player count skyrocketed by more than 700%. It went from a peak concurrent count of around 15,000 users before the update to a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1623730/charts/#1m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 130,000</a> once the update had dropped.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-former-glory">Former Glory</h2>



<p>It might have seen a sudden surge in players, but Palworld likely won’t ever be restored to what it once was. In January, when the Palworld hype train was in full flow, the game peaked at 2.1 million concurrent players on Steam, putting it near the top of the leaderboard for the most-played game ever on the platform. It was an overnight sensation driven by the ‘Pokémon with guns’ trope that pulled so many users into it.</p>



<p>Things have gone relatively quiet for Palworld since then, but this latest update has stoked the embers a little. </p>



<p>According to Pocket Pair, the game’s developer, there’s plenty on the horizon. Coming later this year is an arena mode that’ll see players fight against other users, much like they would in a traditional Pokémon battle. Only, as it’s Palworld, it’ll be fused with assault rifles and grenades.</p>



<p>Are you returning to Palworld with this latest update?</p>

<p>The First Descendant is set to be released in just a couple of days, and with each passing hour, more information is being uncovered. Recently, eagle-eyed users identified a character model variant in the game that’s even more risque than Stellar Blade’s Eve – ‘Ultimate Bunny’. In The First Descendent, ‘Ult Bunny’ has a lore-driven, incredibly skimpy outfit, leaving almost nothing to the imagination.</p>



<p>Marketing, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-ultimate-outfit">The Ultimate Outfit</h2>



<p>In The First Descendant, players can assume control of a Standard or an Ultimate character. Over time, more Ult characters will be added to the game, but there are a few available at launch to kick off the roster, including Lepic and Viessa. The core difference is that Ultimate characters are ‘boosted’, boasting a unique appearance and better stats than their Standard counterparts.</p>



<p>To give a little context, Stellar Blade was released in April to a relatively positive reception, but many players got on board because of the marketing campaign that shed plenty of light on the voluptuous main character, Eve. As they explored the post-apocalyptic slasher, players could unlock and find a series of outfits, almost all of which were highly revealing – with some being extremely controversial.</p>



<p>In The First Descendant, players can assume control of Bunny, who has a figure-hugging bodysuit and a bizarre helmet with – you guessed it – <strong><em>bunny ears.</em></strong></p>



<p><em><strong>However, </strong></em>the Ultimate version of Bunny is adorned in an outfit that may as well not be there, offering almost no real protection and showing off a fair portion of her body. Per the lore, it’s because the suit was never finished – or ‘restored’ – and originally, the plan was that it’d be a complete suit. Go figure, right?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The First Descendant will be released on July 2 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has laid off 33 members of its Ubisoft Toronto staff.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, Ubisoft said the layoffs were part of a "targeted realignment" necessary to ensure it can "deliver on its ambitious roadmap.</p>

<p>"Ubisoft Toronto has decided to conduct a targeted realignment to ensure it can deliver on its ambitious roadmap," a company representative said in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/less-than-a-month-after-joining-work-on-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-toronto-lays-off-33-employees-to-ensure-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, this will impact the roles of 33 team members who will be leaving Ubisoft. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to them, including severance and career assistance, to help through this transition."</p>
<p>It's unclear what departments have been affected by the cuts, or how this may impact Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake that Ubisoft Toronto was recently brought in to support. However, Ubisoft insists "our plan remains unchanged, and our teams are working to deliver on the Splinter Cell remake and other projects at the studio".</p>
<p>This is just the latest in an long line of studio shutdowns and redundancies, and marks an unflinchingly miserable time for games and the people who make them. By the end of May 2024 – so not even halfway through the year – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people had been laid off from their jobs this year across the industry</a>.</p>
<p>When Ed wrote the article above at the end of May, 10,000 people had lost their jobs in the games industry. Now, that total has increased to 10,800. For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning more devs have been impacted by the layoffs so far in 2024 in less than half the time.</p>
<p>"The layoffs will slow down. Most of the big companies have made their moves now, and hopefully they won't need to go further (some analysts speaking to GamesIndustry.biz believe companies may now need to hire back up within a few years). But the pain isn't over," wrote GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring for Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">the state of video game layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot had spoken out to condemn "the malicious and personal online attacks" directed at its developers</a>, in the wake of the online fallout from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' reveal.</p>

We’ve all been there. The barrier to entry for many tabletop, card, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a> can sometimes be high, with some games’ starter kits starting well <a href="https://zdcs.link/KKR4j" target="_blank">over $100</a>. It can be intimidating to get into certain board games due to budget, and that’s a shame. </p><p>Whether you’re getting that special gamer in your life a birthday gift or hosting a casual game night with close friends, plenty of budget options exist that are sure to scratch that itch. And we’ve compiled some of our favorites right here!</p><h2>TL;DR: These Are the Best Cheap Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><u></u><a href="https://zdcs.link/Bdy2v" target="_blank">Qwirkle</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#boss-monster"><u>Boss Monster 10th Anniversary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#chameleon"><u>The Chameleon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#decrypto"><u>Decrypto</u></a></li><li><u></u><a href="https://zdcs.link/vdk12" target="_blank">Targi</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/V0w3L" target="_blank">Hand Games 21</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#betrayal"><u>Betrayal: Deck of Lost Souls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#old"><u>You’re Getting Old</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#coup"><u>Coup</u></a></li><li><u></u><a href="https://zdcs.link/OdpJB" target="_blank">Say Anything</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#taco-cat"><u>Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#poop"><u>Poop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#couch"><u>Couch Skeletons</u></a></li></ul><h2>Board Games Under $30</h2><h3>Qwirkle</h3><div id="202576" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Qwirkle</h3></p></div><p>Qwirkle is one of a tiny handful of games that have won the biggest trophy in the scene, the Spiel des Jahres, and gone on to become a mainstream hit in its own right. And what’s more, you can now pick up a copy for under $30. Its success is down to a combination of intuitive gameplay and addictive tactical smarts. The game pieces are tiles with differently coloured shapes on them, and on your turn you can play any number that share a colour or shape, into a line or column that shares the same colour or shape. You then score a point for each tile in the sequence, plus a bonus if you complete a set of six shapes or colours. The result combines the familiar spatial strategies of Scrabble with all sorts of head-spinning opportunities to set up future plays or block opponents.
</p><h3 id="boss-monster">Boss Monster</h3><div id="197937" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Boss Monster 10th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p>A personal favorite of mine, Boss Monster is a love-letter to a bygone era of early pixel art RPG video games, filled to the brim with heroes, dungeons, spells, and of course, boss monsters. In it, <em>you</em> are the boss monster, building your dungeon and setting various traps to kill the heroes before they slay you first. Each Boss card has unique abilities that will inform your dungeon-building strategy, and you can even disrupt your opponents’ dungeons by buffing heroes adventuring through them. Boss Monster is designed for 2-4 players, and the 10th Anniversary edition of this replayable classic also comes with 15 brand new cards.</p><h3 id="chameleon">The Chameleon</h3><div id="197938" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Chameleon</h3></p></div><p>The Chameleon is an easy to pick up, quick-to-play social deduction game. At the beginning of the round, players are dealt face down cards, one of them being the Chameleon. Players not dealt this card are then issued a secret code word, unbeknownst to the Chameleon, and must use tricky wordplay and conversation to oust the Chameleon, all while that player tries their best to blend in. This is great for quick rounds, parties, or the local brewery.</p><h3 id="decrypto">Decrypto</h3><div id="162032" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Decrypto</h3></p></div><p>Decrypto is another clever wordplay game -- make sure you have plenty of extra paper and pencils ready to go just in case. Each round consists of two teams, with one player from either team working to decipher a secret code and pass it onto their team. The other team has the opportunity to steal if you fail to pass along the code. Set up is quick and easy, and the secret code pieces are plentiful enough that you won’t have much overlap for multiple games. Highly team-oriented and fast-paced rounds make Decrypto a must-play for larger gaming groups. </p><h2>Board Games Under $20</h2><h3>Targi</h3><div id="202577" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Targi</h3></p></div><p>Sometimes cheap games are fairly light affairs, great for family time, but less so for long-term investments that grow on you over time. Targi is a rare exception, a two-player only title that comes in at around 20 dollars, but which can last a lifetime of exploration. Play involves a grid of randomly placed cards around which you place pieces against a row or column, locking that position up from your opponent, and you’ll eventually gain the cards at the intersections where your placements meet. Some give you resources, while the point-scoring cards you’ll need to win cost them, but there are severe limits on how much of either you can collect. Combining tense tactical placement with head-scratching hand and resource management, this is a gem you can pick up for a bargain price.</p><h3>Hand Games 21</h3><div id="202578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hand Games 21</h3></p></div><p>Games don’t come much cheaper than those you can play with your hands alone, like Rock, Paper, Scissors. And for the modest entry fee of fifteen bucks, you can add 21 new hand games to your repertoire, all of which are much better and more creative than that hoary old chestnut. Your hands will be transformed into those of a wizard, hurling spells at your opponents, or those of a banker, grabbing and counting wads of cash at lightning speed. If you want something a little less action-oriented, there are puzzle games involving hidden fingers and social deduction games that eschew the traditional cards and dice. It’s an impressive feat of design chops, and it doesn’t involve your feet at all. And of course, once someone’s invested the price of the book, you can spread the games to your friends for free.</p><h3 id="betrayal">Betrayal: Deck of Lost Souls</h3><div id="197343" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Betrayal Deck of Lost Souls Card Game</h3></p></div><p>A Tarot card-inspired <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror-themed board game</a>, Betrayal: Deck of Lost Souls is a cooperative strategy game in which players must work together to defeat the numerous monsters and horrors they’ll face. The catch: one player is secretly a traitor, trying to bring about the one true Curse. Highly stylized and macabre art makes this a great gift for horror fans. This standalone card game consists of over 90 Item, Curse, Character, and Omen cards, creating endless potential for a fresh and exciting experience each time you play. Also check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill buyer's guide</a>.</p><h3 id="old">You're Getting Old</h3><div id="197940" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>You're Getting Old</h3></p></div><p>Best enjoyed by skinny-jean-wearing, avocado-toast-eating, will-never-be-able-to-afford-a-house Millennials, You’re Getting Old is a classic “never have I ever” style card game that tells you that yes, you are in fact getting old. To start the round, each player draws a card with prompts that make them old and ones that redeem them. If you can answer what “deadass” means, you’re redeemed and move down a space using your avocado token. The player who gets to the highest space first by being old ends the game, and whoever has the lowest position wins. Quick and easy set up, and great for making fun of your friends.</p><h3 id="coup">Coup</h3><div id="197941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Coup Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Looking to test out your lying abilities? Coup is the game for you. In it, players fight over gaining or losing influence as they struggle to be the last one standing. Take actions to steal currency from another player, or counteractions to block foreign aid or stealing. Subterfuge is at the forefront here, as you’ll often have the opportunity to use character card abilities you may not actually control, but be warned: other players can challenge you, and if you’re caught, you lose influence. When you lose your two influence cards, you’re out of the game and the next round begins until one player is left. </p><h2>Board Games Under $10</h2><h3>Say Anything</h3><div id="202584" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Say Anything</h3></p></div><p>If you want to thrill a big group of players with a brilliant party game you can pick up on the cheap, you won’t do better than Say Anything. Players take turns drawing a question card and picking one to ask: everyone else then writes and reveals their answer. Once they’re all public, everyone secretly bets on which answer the question-asker will like the best before the big reveal, when you’ll find out who’s hit the jackpot and who’s going empty-handed into the next round. Like all the best party games, it’s a very simple formula that’s likely to inspire some big laughs and some spicy table chat, and at this price it’s entirely worth adding to your after dinner party repertoire.
</p><h3 id="taco-cat">Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</h3><div id="197942" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</h3></p></div><p>A quick, easy, and insanely addictive card game, Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza is perfect for families and will put your reflexes to the test. The goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and doing so requires focus and concentration. Players take turns in a clockwise order, and you say aloud either taco, cat, goat, cheese, or pizza in that order while playing your card. If the word you say and the face-up card match, players must slap the card and the last player to do so adds the face-up pile to their deck. This makes for great laughs and all-around competitive silliness that is well worth its price.</p><h3 id="poop">Poop</h3><div id="197943" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Poop The Game</h3></p></div><p>Similar to Uno, Poop the Game is a numbers-based strategy card game where the goal is to dump (no pun intended) your hand to win. Each round has players take turns pooping but be wary not to clog the toilet: if you play the card that makes the poop pile exceed the number on the toilet card, you take all of those cards, and the round starts over. There are also special cards that reverse turn order and color-based strategies to “flush” the toilet. Thankfully, Poop the Game has no scratch and sniff components.</p><h3 id="couch">Couch Skeletons</h3><div id="197944" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Couch Skeleton</h3></p></div><p>Super quick and easy set up and short play time makes Couch Skeletons a great pick for a small gift or travel game. You and another player take turns placing numbered skeletons on one of five couches, with the card you play being either one number higher or lower than the skeletons in play. If you have no cards to play, you then discard your hand, and the next round starts by drawing three cards. The goal is to get rid of all your cards from both your hands and empty the draw decks, and you win when you’ve played all your cards and aren’t able to draw.</p><p>Be sure to also check out our recommendations for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">best party games</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games"><u>best 2-player board games</u></a>.</p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.

			<p>Following the collaboration <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-marvel-collaborate-games-tv-shows-comic-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Marvel and NetEase five years ago, NetEase unveiled the Overwatch-like competitive 6 versus 6 third-person shooter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-is-an-overwatch-like-6v6-pvp-third-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Closed Beta test, which will run from July 23 to August with the following content (Characters: Adam Warlock, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Groot, Hela, Hulk, Iron Man, Loki, Luna Snow, Magik, Magneto, Mantis, Namor, Peni Parker, Punisher, Rocket Raccoon, Star-Lord, Storm, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, and Venom; Maps: Yggsgard: Yggdrasill Path, Yggsgard: Royal Palace, Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya, and Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands; Modes: Convoy, Domination, and Convergence), we interviewed Executive Producer Danny Koo and Game Director Thad Sasser at Summer Game Fest 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="TOKYO 2099: SPIDER-ISLANDS - JOURNEY INTO LIFE AND DESTINY | Map Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqnZzywDfTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>With the roster being as diverse as it is, I was curious - what was your design philosophy for choosing roles for each character?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> First of all, we know Marvel characters are iconic, so there are certain expectations fans expect out of the characters. So, we picked the three most important things about the characters if we were to represent them in the game. Once we identify them, then we'll pair the skills and assign the role after. The entire Marvel Rivals roster kind of consists of about 70 percent fan favorite, greatest pitch, and we'll throw in some curveball on the rest. For some players, this game might be their first time learning about these characters. Since this is a global game, and it's on PC and consoles, everyone gets exposure to this diverse cast of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Did you think about possibly doing an alternate version of the characters, like Iron Man in a different role?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> I don't think we've really kind of thought about that. I think the way we think about it is, as Danny said, the first and most important thing is really the character, right? Representing the iconic nature of that character, finding those three things that are true to it. And then the class or the role kind of comes later. You might see, and I'm not saying there is or there isn't, but you might see a character completely shift their power set based on events that happened in the narrative that we tell as the game evolves.</p>
<p>Maybe this character had a change in their circumstances. Things have changed for them and now they're a different type of play experience. That would be the kind of thing we would love to experiment with and get player feedback on. So, we'd love to hear more ideas like that.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> Yeah, a lot of players in the hero shooter genre got used to the notion of tank, DPS, and support. But in Marvel Rivals, we take it further because Marvel heroes don't hang in the back; they're just clashing. So there are hybrid roles that a lot of characters have. That's why we have Vanguard, Duelists, and Strategists, which can turn the tide of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> And those are less about a hard role and more about kind of like almost the gameplay style or choice. The Vanguard is gonna jump into the midst of the enemies, while the Duelists are going to maneuver up and stay in close combat, keep the pressure on, and the Strategists are trying to figure out how can I disrupt, how can I buff my party or debuff the enemy.</p>
<p>Some of the characters might even currently, in their current state, be able to do some of these jobs that they're not necessarily the best at, but they can still kind of move around a little bit. So there's a little bit more flexibility than a rigid class definition, which you might be used to.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> There's the synergy skills as well. When Rocket jumps on Groot, it becomes like a giant tank with a machine gun.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're not even thinking about eSports. Once we establish a strong foundation for the community, this will grow organically instead of forcibly.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>A lot of online games tend to feature a Prime or powered-up version of a particular character. Would Marvel Rivals experiment with stuff like Ultimate Spider-Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> I know there are a bunch of opinions among friends that this Spider-Man or that Spider-Man is the best. There are so many opportunities for us to do stuff like a different costume or maybe introduce a different voice line. But we haven't announced all this detail in terms of costumes and variance yet. We want each main playable character to have a different playstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider the costumes to be more like a seasonal reward or something that players can unlock as an additional skin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We haven't announced the monetization mechanism or anything yet. But I can tell you that during the Alpha, players do quests to get currency to unlock skins and costumes. We have those in the Alpha, and we look forward to that in beta as well.</p>
<p><strong>How can players customize the identity of the characters in Marvel Rivals? Some games have emotes, voice lines, or sprays that players can customize. What sort of options are there in this game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> Yes, we know that's important to players and we'll have some options. We're not going to talk about the details yet, but in the Alpha we did have the spray.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>It's pretty standard in Alpha, but we have a few surprises in store for later.</p>
<p><strong>As the roster grows over time, would you consider adding a pick-and-ban system to the hero list?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> Yeah, I think that kind of feature would be something we'd be looking for feedback from the community, right? Is this something that's required that the community thinks is best in a competitive playlist, for example? Or is this a casual mode thing? Or should it apply everywhere? And that kind of thing would be something we would talk about and, you know, we'll have an opportunity to try these things out and see what the feedback is, really, before we go wide with it.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Ultimately, we build this game for the community, not for us. I have a different opinion than all these guys. But, you know, we want to take care of the community. They're going to spend time on this game, so we might as well ask hey, what do you guys want?</p>
<p><strong>How are you going to support Marvel Rivals at the eSports level?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We want to make this game, first and foremost, the best-in-class PvP. We're not even thinking about eSports. Once we establish a strong foundation for the community, I think this will grow organically instead of forcibly.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a spectator mode for players who want to run tournaments, build an orbit around them, and watch the action without being players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Yes, that is already in the game. There is a spectator mode, and we have a custom game in there, where players can play a custom game however they want with anybody. We have cross-region play as well, where players can invite their friends internationally and play with each other. After each match, there's a reason why we put the entire team up instead of focusing on one MVP. You get to check the highlights of everyone who plays on your team to share the glory.</p>
<p><strong> Which platforms are you planning to launch Marvel Rivals on? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Right now, we announced PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><strong>Are you talking about cross-platform play between them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Yes, and we'll be cross-play in beta as well.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. How about cross-progression? Are you implementing a NetEase profile so that if someone unlocks something on a PC, they can carry it to PlayStation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>To be decided. As you can imagine, that's extremely complicated to pull off, so we're still looking into it. We've heard that the audience has already suggested this several times, so we're looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>Are you implementing rollback netcode or something of that sort to help stabilize online connection for players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Well, the stability and the quality of the online connection are very important for us, so we'll have a number of different systems. I don't necessarily have all the technical details at the moment, but that is definitely a big concern for us because low latency and high-quality gameplay are some of the things that make a game fun: feeling comfortable with the controls and feeling comfortable with the experience is very important, and we recognize that as a priority for us.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> That's why we are going to have North America, Europe, and other regions in the beta that we haven't announced yet. I can tell you from the Alpha within the North American region that the ping is very stable, so we're happy about that now. But the more testing, the better.</p>
<p><strong>As far as the breadth of content you guys can pull from, is there anything that's off-limits for Marvel Rivals?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Anything is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We have over 9,000 characters in Marvel. 85 years of Marvel history. But when we put a character in there, it has to be with a reason, not just because. Any character has to relate to the lore and the story as well as the other characters on the existing roster. This is a Marvel Universe game, and we want to have a roster of characters from the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the X-Men. We don't want it to just be an Avengers or an X-Men game; we want it to have everybody in it.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any sort of playable narrative mode? Or is it mostly competing in matches against each other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We're focusing on PvP. But, within the map, within the voice dialogues, within the bios they can unlock, it's very detailed on what the story is, and the player can piece it together. Like, for example, in the map that you played (Odin's Palace), there's one starting point where you can see a family portrait.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We might not do another beta if the first one is great.'</figcaption></figure>
<p>What's going on there? And then, and then you get a hint of, like, what the map looks like with a giant battle plan at the starting point. And that's like a little, little sprinkle to slowly tell the story. In the Odin Palace, some destructible get reconstructed, and there's a reason why: Loki is the king, and that's his illusion. In other maps, there are also different ways in which destructible environments tell a story.</p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>This will tie into things like the game modes as well, right? The Payload object might be different based on the context and what it is that you're doing.</p>
<p><strong>For objective modes like Payload, is each map going to kind of have the same objectives each time you play through or will it pull random objectives for each round?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>The maps are very specific because they are tuned for that particular game mode, but each map does support multiple game modes. So, if you play best of seven, then you will not see like your regular mode. There will be certain expectations of objectives within.</p>
<p><strong>Are you talking about accessibility options, such as high-contrast character profile models, like Black Panther in a darker environment, which might be hard to spot for some players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Yes, accessibility is a key issue for us. In fact, we want this game to be very accessible and we are looking at several levels of accessibility. Not just whether users can understand this and learn it and master it, but also what if you're colorblind? What if you're hard of hearing? What can we do to help all different types of players? How many different types of players can we get in here? We'd love it if every player could enjoy Marvel Rivals. That said, obviously, there are practical limits to what we can accomplish, but it's important to us.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Yeah, we would never have an overly dark environment. Even I couldn't. I don't have to be disabled to want that. We wanted it to be a very colorful, vibrant, and inviting environment. And then, of course, some people can't see red. And we support controller mode on PC, also for the people who can't use keyboard and mouse. We even have alternative controller styles.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, the character models are very contrasted. They have colors that pop compared to the environments, which are much more muted, so it's easy to recognize the action from afar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>That's intentional, as we spend a lot of time looking at that. How visible are these characters in this environment? And we're continually tweaking that. In fact, not that long ago, we made some changes to increase the visibility of characters in environments. We have some tricks we're doing now.</p>
<p><strong>I know you guys have another closed test coming up. How is your test schedule shaping up for the inevitable launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>It depends on the result of the closed beta. We might not do another beta if it's great, right? Otherwise, we might do another round of beta. So, we don't know yet. Right now, we're focusing on beta. But we got a lot of feedback from the Alpha where people said, why don't you launch it right now? It's already done. We were like, no, no, no. No, it's not done. The job's not finished.</p>
<p>That was an ongoing discussion on our Discord. By the way, if you're not on our Discord, we have a community of over 230K users. If the game is not ready, it's not ready. But when it is, we're definitely looking forward to announcing this news to everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>We have the closed beta coming up at the end of July, which we'll discuss more shortly.</p>
<p><strong> Is the closed beta going to be PC only or will it also include consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>It'll be available on all three platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Players can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> right now, and they'll receive a notification when they can join the beta.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to do any pre-purchase or founder pack bonuses that you can talk about for Marvel Rivals?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>The beta is going to be free for everybody. We're not doing anything extra on top of that.</p>
<p><strong>What's on the table for post-launch content for Marvel Rivals, whether it's characters, maps, or modes? What are you guys looking at?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Yes. The answer is yes. What does the audience want? What needs are not being met, or what do they want to see more of? What's working really well? We'll have to check all these things.</p>
<p><strong>Alright, well, thank you all so very much for your time.</strong></p>
