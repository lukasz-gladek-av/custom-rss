			<p>Following the State of Play, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ps5-pro-developers-share-how-theyre-using-new-tech-to-enhance-their-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a lengthy blog post filled with details on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro</a> launch games straight from game developers. It's a recap of what you can expect to find in some of the biggest triple-A games when you launch them on your shiny new console come November 7.</p>
<p>As a reminder, pre-orders start tomorrow through the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and participating retailers. The console is priced at $699.99 USD, £699.99 GBP, €799.99 EUR, and ¥119,980 JPY (includes tax), featuring a 2TB SSD, a DualSense controller, and a copy of Astro’s Playroom.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 5 Pro Console - Game Lineup Sizzle" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B8WUK59YYJ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Gran Turismo 7:</strong> PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution on PS5 Pro is also effective on 4K sources, allowing for even more detail and higher image quality than ever before. The game now supports ray tracing during races, not only for car surfaces to show full reflections of other cars but also for a car to reflect its own parts. Furthermore, Gran Turismo 7 will feature experimental support for 8K/60fps output.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Horizon Forbidden West/Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered:</strong> In Horizon Forbidden West, you can now enjoy a visual quality that matches or surpasses the Quality mode on the regular PlayStation 5, but at 60 FPS (twice the framerate). Also, there are many improvements to the Decima engine that are now made possible because of the rendering power of PS5 Pro. You’ll see improvement in shadows, depth-of-field, skin and hair shaders, clouds, god rays, and more. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered also comes with native support for PlayStation 5 Pro. This includes a range of graphical features that have been improved to use the power of the PS5 Pro while delivering ultra-high fidelity at blazing-fast framerates.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TLOUPart2RemasteredPS5Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>The Last of Us Part I and II Remastered:</strong> Each game will offer a new PS5 Pro-specific enhanced rendering mode that uses improved graphics processing, rendering at 1440p, then upscaling to 4K via PSSR super-resolution. This mode maintains the 60 FPS target, offering an ideal balance of framerate and resolution. Performance and Fidelity rendering modes are still available on PS5 Pro, providing an even smoother experience than players would see on an original PS5 and a higher framerate if your display supports it.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Marvel's Spider-Man and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart:</strong> Players of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 will find a new default Performance Pro mode, combining the 4K resolution and ray tracing features of Fidelity mode with the 60 FPS of Performance mode.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hogwarts Legacy:</strong> With the increased performance capabilities of the PS5 Pro, the quality of the Performance and Fidelity visual modes has improved without compromising player experience. Players will be able to experience crisper, higher-resolution graphics, leveraging PSSR on all visual modes. The additional GPU performance power allowed an overhaul of the Fidelity Ray tracing visual mode to present the game in a new light. Players will notice new reflections and ray-traced shadows in all environments.<a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hogwarts-Legacy-PS5-Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2, Resident Evil Village, and Resident Evil 4:</strong> Dragon’s Dogma 2 will benefit from the power of the PS5 Pro, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), and new ray tracing technology, allowing improved framerates. For Resident Evil Village, CAPCOM added a 120 FPS gameplay option when running the game on the new console. For Resident Evil 4, CAPCOM only confirmed higher framerates.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</strong> The game’s Fidelity and Performance modes will see improvements on the new console, including improved resolution in 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. Additionally, there will be various improved visual settings across 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. BioWare also noted that PSSR allows for 'upgraded image quality'. Lastly, the PS5 Pro version of the game includes ray traced ambient occlusion on the 60FPS performance modes, which is only available in the 30FPS mode on the base PlayStation 5.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: </strong>The Quality Mode offers the game's highest-ever console resolution at 2160p. At the same time, Performance Mode still delivers 60 FPS, but now with higher resolution, ray traced reflections, and ray traced ambient occlusion. Finally, the new PSSR upscaling ensures a sharper visual experience in both modes.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Alan Wake 2:</strong> Ray tracing has been added to the Quality mode. Remedy also used the additional power of PS5 Pro to improve the visuals and effects in the 60 FPS Performance mode, improving the rendering resolution from the PS5's 1440p to 4K.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth:</strong> The new Enhanced Mode developed especially for PS5 Pro runs at a frame rate of 60 FPS and supports PSSR to achieve a resolution on par with that of Graphics Mode.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows:</strong> The game will take advantage of the PS5 Pro to deliver enhanced ray-traced global illumination technology. Thanks to PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) and combined with the more powerful GPU, players will see improved rendering systems.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Stellar Blade:</strong> With the PlayStation 5 Pro, players will be able to enjoy the game in 4K resolution at 50fps or higher, and you’ll notice an improvement in grain and detail in the game in PSSR upscale mode. Plus, the HFR (high framerate) option is supported, allowing you to enjoy a smooth gaming experience at 80 fps (120hz display support required).</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gran-Turismo-7-PS5-Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>The First Descendant:</strong> NEXON is leveraging PS5 Pro’s superior GPU performance and enhanced ray tracing architecture to achieve more lifelike and natural lighting and shadow effects compared to the standard PS5. Additionally, by utilizing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the game will run at a higher resolution and with better image quality. The developers are also currently working on enabling FSR 3.1 Frame Generation to provide improved framerates.</em></p>

            <p>There is an absolute carkfest of a headline to be written here involving the words "head" "not" "enough" and "giving", but I am a journalist of grace and discretion, and will resist. Treyarch, Raven Software and Activision have popped up a note-to-players covering a range of improvements they're making to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in the aftermath of August's beta. Specifically, they're tweaking the damage from bullets to the cranium, while trying to ensure that bullets to the cranium don't "significantly affect the consistency of time to kill".</p><!--more-->
<p>"A common piece of feedback we saw was that low headshot damage reduced the impact of skillful play and made it difficult to challenge certain power positions," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1938090/view/4708039771691823303?l=english">comments the Steam post in question</a>. "We agree with these points and are working on adjustments to many weapons to reward players who land multiple headshots during an engagement. That said, we do not want hit location multipliers to significantly affect the consistency of time to kill in Black Ops 6, so we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of headshots during launch and beyond."</p>
<p>I know little and wish to know little about the real-life efficacy of headshots. I know slightly more about the concept of time-to-kill in shooters. It's a deceptively simple-sounding metric that can transform your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> entirely. Stretch out the seconds a player can last under fire and you've got a relatively sedate, borderline-RPG experience, in which duellists have leisure to dart and circle and get to know each other between bursts. Shrink them back down, and (if you're a terrible player, like me), you've got an extremely fast Game-Over montage, with the occasional hint of a pointed rifle in the scarlet haze of your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>COD has historically been a low TTK shooter, and it doesn't feel like you're all that spongier in Black Ops 6, but then again, I rarely land a headshot. I wish Treyarch and Raven Software the best of luck cooking the books, because it's the kind of thing the fans have extensive, unpunctuated opinions about.</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive round-up of other stuff they're pruning and polishing, siphoned from that Steam post:</p>
<p>- "Bullet Penetration is another system that we will be improving for launch. In general players should notice fewer extreme cases of bullets doing far too much damage through certain surfaces (AKA Wall Bang), while also not penetrating as expected through others (e.g., those pesky snipers behind the radar dish on Scud)." </p>
<p>- "We're also evaluating some changes to cover placement across multiple maps, including some of our Beta maps, which we'll be able to share more details on closer to launch."</p>
<p>- "Players may have noticed improvements to spawn logic throughout Weekend 2 of the Beta, and as new content comes into the game and we generate even more spawn data, we're always assessing our spawn system and will continue to make necessary updates to it through launch and beyond."</p>
<p>- "Over the course of the Beta, we identified several areas that were impacting in-game performance. Some areas where we've made progress on performance include resolving general script errors, addressing issues related to our in-game user interface as well as overall improvements and fixes to our asset streaming. A smooth game performance is paramount to the player experience, and we've been able to chase down sources of in-game "hitching" and deploy major fixes since the close of the Beta."</p>
<p>- "We identified several areas for improvement to our 3rd-Person animation fidelity across slide, dive, jump and supine prone. Our goal is that what you see in 1st Person is representative of what others see in 3rd Person in order to maintain immersion and predictability."</p>
<p>They're also trying to pin down a "nice middle ground" for "the time before you could enter supine during a slide", while reducing the minimum time before you can slide while sprinting. This latter twist is designed to reduce the odds of a "dead slide", wherein you accidentally crouch instead of sliding. Truly, performing a dead slide is an abysmal faux pas of Austenian dimensions, much like referencing sex acts in headlines or singing "just the two of us" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6">when you're a meatshield</a>.</p>
<p>Circle-strafing back to the angst over headshots - what's your preferred blend of TTK and hit location multiplier? I always think it's quite jolly when players scurry about with arrows and whatnot sticking out of their ears. Blops 6 is out 25th October. In other news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developer-union-have-accused-activision-blizzard-and-microsoft-of-bad-faith-bargaining">unionised workers at Raven Software are pursuing a complaint against Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, alleging "bad faith bargaining".</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Museum Is Light on History, Big on Fun]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-museum-is-light-on-history-big-on-fun.991452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-museum-in-person-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A good open-world game often has that emotional moment when the world opens up for the very first time. Take peering out at Hyrule from the grand plateau after leaving the first cave in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for example. And while  the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto is a comparatively  small sandbox to Breath of the Wild’s huge open world, reaching the exhibition floor after climbing the escalator for the first time feels just as special. Greeted with familiar music and sound effects, you’re instantly invited  to a Nintendo fan’s paradise that extends 360 degrees. </p><p>As you enter the exhibition floor, jumbo-sized versions of different Nintendo controllers and consoles can be seen hanging from the ceiling, with all the hardware and software that Nintendo has produced over the years displayed beneath them. Like Breath of the Wild’s open world,  no correct order to the exhibits, so you are free to roam in any direction  you please. And despite the sheer number of exhibits, I never felt overwhelmed or lost. It almost felt as if Nintendo was using its expertise in level design to curate the museum.</p><p>However, despite the abundance of Nintendo products on display there are very few items like development materials, original drawings, or prototypes that you can’t find anywhere else, which was disappointing. And for a museum, the amount of explanation and context that Nintendo gives to its displays is also surprisingly limited. As a longtime Nintendo fan, I found myself hoping for more than just final products, and I would have liked some deeper context added to the exhibits. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>Instead of focusing on its past, Nintendo seems to following the same ethos as it does for its games: make an experience thatanyone can pick up and play, with minimal tutorial explanations. The Nintendo Museum lets you experience the company’s 135 year history with that same philosophy in mind.</p><p>From the NES to the Nintendo Switch, and GameBoy to 3DS, all the game consoles that Nintendo has produced are on display together with their own games as well as some of the major third-party titles. There are even some of those nostalgic peripherals. Gameplay for the games  on display can be seen on screens as well.</p><p>A little bit of context is added to each display, showing how sales were divided per territory for each console, what series started on each hardware, and what kind of new challenges and technology were introduced.</p><p>Almost all of the software has both a Japanese, North American and European package at display. Just by walking around, it becomes apparent how much more global the industry has become. While games often had different titles and package art depending on the region during the NES days, releases on the Nintendo Switch pretty much all look the same for each territory.</p><p>If you’re visiting the museum from overseas, seeing the Japanese package art for your favorite games while still being able to take a nostalgic glimpse at the art you grew up with creates a nice balance. Old TV commercials and video game magazines from multiple regions also take visitors back to their childhood. It happened to me a few times when I suddenly saw an image that I didn’t even know I was nostalgic for.</p><p>It is true that almost all of what you can see on this floor can be found through Google, YouTube, or a good retro video game store. However, having everything cleverly displayed on the same floor does feel unique and may lead to some new discoveries.</p><p>For example, while the Wii U might not exactly be Nintendo’s most successful console, seeing it on display between Nintendo’s other consoles made me rediscover its importance. Major modern franchises such as Splatoon and Mario Maker debuted there, the idea of being able to play games on both your TV and a portable device that made the Nintendo Switch so popular was conceived, and the Amiibo product lineup launched during the Wii U era.  </p><p>Of course, Nintendo wasn’t making video games when the company was founded way back in 1889. It all started with Hanafuda cards and later expanded to playing cards in North America, where they collaborated with Disney. Some visitors will be surprised to see products that feature Mickey Mouse, Lady and the Tramp and Bambi, instead of  Mario, Pikachu and Kirby.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/interactive-exhibit-shigureden-sp-04-1727233835297.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Looking at Nintendo’s older products, it becomes obvious that Nintendo already had that playful and inventive spirit long before they started to expand their business into video games. From playing cards, they went on to produce a wide array of board games that came in all sorts of themes, to even a baby stroller and  “light telephone”, which is  an obscure device that uses light to transport sound.  It was thought of by Gunpei Yokoi, best known as the father of the GameBoy. Yokoi’s unique ideas like the Ultra Hand, the Ultra Machine and the Love Tester made Nintendo even more unique in the late 60’s, w eventually shapeshifting  into the inventive video game company it istoday. </p><p>The museum presents the history of Nintendo and its characters through different, creative, themes, showing how elements like the  Nintendo logo changed over time, how Mario’s question block evolved, the history of products that incorporate music, and products played by moving the body.</p><p>While there isn’t all that much to learn for Nintendo fans who have done their homework, seeing everything come together in a well designed space functions as a celebration of the company’s rich history.</p><p>While you will probably be left disappointed if you were hoping to see never-before-seen,  behind-the-scenes material, prototypes of the Nintendo Dolphin, the Wii Remote and the Wii Balance Board are present. But for some reason these items were displayed discreetly at the back of the exhibition floor.</p><p>The first floor has a wide array of interactive activities to enjoy.These activities, which are themed after Nintendo’s past products, have the playfulness that people have come to expect from Nintendo’s games. To be honest, I wasn’t exactly impressed when I saw Shigeru Miyamotoshoot at goombas at the museum’s shooting gallery or hit furniture with the Ultra Machine’s batting-cage experience during last month’s Nintendo Museum Direct. However, once I got to experience these myself, I couldn’t help but smile at the care that Nintendo put into these simple yet cute experiences.</p><p>At the shooting gallery, my Zapper was accurate enough to hit targets that were quite far away. At the end of the game, each player's score is counted simultaneously, making it exciting to see who got the highest score. </p><p>And the little reactions of the objects that you hit with the Ultra Machine are so cute that I wanted to try every one of the different rooms available. While humble when compared to the kind of spectacle you can experience at the bigger theme park, Super Nintendo Land  , the simple but thorough production feels very Nintendo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/interactive-exhibit-ultra-hand-sp-1727233835298.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another interactive exhibit let guests play cooperative games using giant NES, SNES and N64 controllers but it proved more difficult than expected. We often found ourselves laughing out loud at our embarrassing faliures.</p><p>I especially enjoyed holding a giant Wii Remote together with my colleague to fly around above Wuhu Island, the main location of Wii Sports Resort. A sea-plane can be steered by tilting the Wii Remote up, down, left, and right, to break balloons. It is a game that uses the entire body, which felt like a full-scale embodiment of the Wii’s motion controls. Considering that this is a game that can only be experienced at the Nintendo Museum, it is something that Nintendo fans should not miss, maybe even more so than the items at the exhibition floor.</p><p>The Love Tester, which measures the level of romance between two players is also an  ideal icebreaker if you’re on a date. Players are told to hold hands or stare at each other and from there, they are tasked to scare away rats and dodge obstacles to keep the balloons attached to their heads safe,moving their hands and head like they would in a Microsoft Kinect game. It's a simple experience, but one that has the uncanny effect of strengthening bonds with the people you are playing with.</p><p>These life-size Mario Party style mini games lets guests interact directly with parts of Nintendo’s history. And it’s through these various experiences that Nintendo showcases its history. As a company that always focused on fun and interactivity, this felt like a natural approach to a museum that celebrates their history. </p><p>However, not all of these experiences can be enjoyed in one visit. The Play Ticket that you receive upon entry comes with only 10 coins, which you can spend to play the experiences. The amount of coins required varies depending on the experience, but don’t expect to be able to enjoy more than 4 or 5  experiences in one visit. On top of that, visitors will likely have to stand in line for each activity once the museum opens to the public, though the wait is helped thanks to the iconic Nintendo music playing through the halls </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/exhibition-building-1-entrance-1727233835294.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although the museum doesn’t have the scale and spectacle of Universal Studios’ Nintendo area, the facility is packed with little secrets and easter eggs. Finding each little detail almost feels like exploring a sandbox in Super Mario Odyssey. From Excite Bike characters on the wall, to Mario hanging on a goal pole, and even a  Pikmin on the top of the museum roof, you are constantly rewarded for carefully observing the environment. </p><p>The lack of never-before-seen historical items and limited explanation can make Kyoto’s Nintendo Museum feel lacking in the traditional sense of the word ‘museum.’ However, its striking exhibition floor, fun, but simple, activities, and attention to detail made me feel like I was enjoying a cozy Nintendo game. </p><p>Observing, exploring and playing my way through the facility, I was subconsciously experiencing the company’s rich history in a unique way. While there may not be much new to see or learn about the company’s full history for the die-hard Nintendo fan, visiting the museum reminds you of why you fell in love with the games in the first place. For those less familiar with Nintendo or video games in general, the museum’s interactive nature makes it something that anybody should be able to enjoy anyway.</p><p>Nintendo Museum opens its doors to the public on October 2.</p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

            <p>Developer Riot has issued a statement to distance itself from a strike by SAG-AFTRA actors' union members against its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> game.</p>
<p>Last night, the actor's union called a strike against Riot's online game due to its connection to Formosa Interactive LLC. Formosa Interactive is a production company involved in making League of Legends, and one which SAG-AFTRA has accused of trying to "subvert the video game strike", which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">announced in July</a>. </p>
<p>The union's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-strikes-league-legends">press release</a> stated <a href="https://formosagroup.com/interactive-projects/">Formosa</a> - which has also worked on the Call of Duty series, Zelda and God of War, among others - attempted to "cancel" one of its games affected by the SAG-AFTRA video game strike in order to continue with non-union actors.</p>
<p>Since then, Riot has issued its own statement, writing "League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned" by SAG-AFTRA.</p>

<p>"We want to be clear: since becoming a union project five years ago, League of Legends has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing otherwise," Riot wrote on social media platform X.</p>
<p>"In addition, we've never asked Formosa to cancel a game that we've registered. All of the allegations in SAG-AFTRA's press release relating to cancelling a game or hiring non-union talent relate to a non-Riot game, and have nothing to do with League or any of our games."</p>
<p>In the press release announcing SAG-AFTRA's League of Legends strike, the union said it believes the actions by Formosa to be "a flagrant violation of labour law" . As such, SAG-AFTRA "has filed an unfair labour practice charge against the company with the National Labor Relations Board".</p> <div>

<p>SAG-AFTRA claims that when Formosa was told it was not possible to "cancel " one of its struck video games, the company "secretly transferred the game to a shell company and sent out casting notices for 'non-union' talent only". In protest, the union called its strike on League of Legends, as this is one of the most high-profile games Formosa has worked on.</p>
<p>"It's bad enough that Formosa and other companies are refusing to agree to the fair AI terms that have been agreed to by the film, television, streaming, and music industries, as well as more than 90 other game developers," said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA.</p>
<p>"To commit illegal unfair labour practices is beyond the pale and won't be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-could-have-more-planned-for-2025-besides-death-stranding-2-ghost-of-yotei/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, and Bungie's Marathon may not be the only big titles Sony will release in 2025, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Following yesterday's State of Play, well-known ResetERA user shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot43-juan-last-time.971316/post-129213615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that the three games mentioned above may not be the only big titles releasing during the course of next year without providing additional information on these unannounced potential 2025 games. Many PlayStation Studios, like Naughty Dog, Bend, and Bluepoint, have yet to reveal their current projects, so there's definitely the chance for 2025 to be a much better year than 2024 for Sony in regards to exclusive releases.</p>
<p>While it has been known for a while that Death Stranding 2 would hit Sony's current generation console <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/">next yea</a>r, we had no idea before yesterday's State of Play that Ghost of Yotei, Ghost of Tsushima's highly-anticipated sequel, would also be released in 2025. From the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/"> reveal trailer</a>, it's clear how the second entry in the series will feature a familiar experience vastly enhanced from a visual standpoint by the power of the PlayStation 5, which allowed for the creation of realistic wind movement on vegetation, better skyboxes, and more. Gameplay will also be improved with new weapons and gameplay mechanics that have yet to be detailed in full.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's State of Play broadcast, BioWare premiered two new Dragon Age: The Veilguard videos. One is a deep dive on the Mage class, and another is dedicated to a boss fight against a Blighted Ice Dragon. Producer Hilary Hidey walked Dragon Age: The Veilguard fans through her process of building the Mage character:</p>
<p><em>As a Mage, I can switch between two weapon sets: a staff for ranged attacks or an elemental orb and dagger for close-quarter combat. I'm facing off against an ice dragon, which is vulnerable to fire, so I've equipped Urthemiel's Ash as my elemental orb. It reduces enemy damage, makes burning last longer and do more damage, and increases the cap of burning stacks. My dagger, Thorn of Misfortune, gives me access to the physical damage type and synergizes with my affliction-based build, increasing the damage of Arcane Bombs, which I build up with repeated orb attacks. I've further powered up my afflictions by equipping this Death Mask, which will give me a nice damage boost. </em></p>
<p><em>Let's switch to my Dragon Age: The Veilguard character skill tree, where I further enhanced my ability to take on this ice dragon. Elemental Catalyst gives my abilities +15% bonus damage, in this case, fire damage, since both my staff and orb are fire-based. Inner Focus generates 25% extra mana from successful light attacks, and that number is doubled against enemies suffering from an affliction, like burning, so each time I attack my burning enemies, I'll generate 50% extra mana, allowing me to cast powerful spells like Meteor more often. The Spellblade specialization blends magic and melee. With the Electrical Burns passive, my fire attacks stack even more afflictions on my targets, applying the shocked affliction whenever I apply burning (and vice versa). Finally, my Spellblade Ultimate ability Thunderous End unleashes a massive amount of damage, shocking enemies in a wide radius.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Dragon Age: The Veilguard producer goes on to show some synergizes and combos with the companions. Once the dragon is staggered, she primes the Sundered status with Lucanis and triggers it with her own character. Normally, she would have to wait a few seconds until Lucanis's ability is once again available, but the Regroup rune instantly refreshes companions' cooldowns, allowing her to repeat the combo right away. The dragon is then finished off with the aforementioned Ultimate ability, Thunderous End.</p>

            <p>Hey, remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>? I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-in-random-review">reviewed it</a> way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe.</p>

<p>The hideous pot creature is called Potboy and you'll need to use his flame "to light your way through a conflicting world of wonder and horror". In the trailer, some old fella says "Who took the sun away?", which hints at this clay world being lost to darkness for a long time (cue flashbacks to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> lore). And thus, why all the dribbly, wrinkly nasties want a bite of your Potboy's flame.</p>
<p>What's pretty extraordinary is the art style, where everything's been sculpted from clay and scanned into the game. It's paired with stop motion animation, too, so the world has an appropriately clumpy feel to it.</p>
<p>It seems like the game's story will be split into "five tales of fire and darkness" and you'll meet a bunch of weirdos on your late night amble. Like a house on legs, a guy with a big hat, and a person with an umbrella. Otherwise, it seems like we'll get to wield a matchstick like it's a shotgun and have Potboy fire some sparks out of his head to light up pathways?</p>
<p>We don't know a great deal more, but what I do know is that I'm cautiously excited for it. It's due out sometime in 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">Steam</a> and will be on Steam VR, too. For the VR version, it seems like it'll use eye-tracking, so you can close your eyes "to focus on the sounds and manipulate the world around you". Huh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>However, while Palworld has debuted on PS5 across 68 countries and regions worldwide, it has not yet been released in Japan.</p>

<p>This detail was revealed by Palworld's Japanese social media team early this morning.</p>
<p>In a post shared on X, the account said "the release date in Japan has not yet been decided"  (Google translated).</p>
<p>"We apologise to everyone in Japan who was looking forward to it, but all of our staff will do our best to deliver it to PS5 users as soon as possible, so we hope you will wait for a little longer," it continued. "We look forward to your continued support of Palworld."</p>
<p>While a reason for Japan's PS5 omission was not given, it is fair to surmise it has something to do with the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing Pocketpair for patent infringement</a>. Pocketpair claims it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">unaware of which patents it has infringed</a>, though recent reports suggest it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">patent to do with how players throw Pokéballs</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Ahead of its release, many dubbed Palworld 'Pokémon with guns' due to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">similarities with Nintendo's own creature-catching game</a>. Palworld was the first big mega-hit of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">surpassing 2m concurrent players on Steam back in January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Pocketpair and Sony for further comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When you stare into the PlayStation Showcase, it stares also into you. Open world samurai action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost Of Tsushima</a> is getting a follow-up called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost Of Yotei</a>, developers Sucker Punch have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/">announced</a> (or Ghost Of Yōtei, to include the technically-correct-but-annoying-to-reproduce-on-UK-keyboards diacritic that I will hereby drop to secure our sanity). It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.</p>

<p>You'll be slitting throats as Atsu, a "wandering warrior" seemingly out for revenge. This time the game will be set in Hokkaido, Japan, we're told, in the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei, a snowcapped mountain in the southwest of the island. The year is 1603, which is Japan's Edo period and much later than the first game's historical setting of  the 13th century. Which is a more familiar setting in terms of Japanese history as depicted in modern media (well it is to me, at least).   </p>
<p>"In 1603, this area was outside the rule of Japan," say the developers, "and filled with sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers. It’s a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima..."</p>
<p>There's no strict PC confirmation yet, but considering the previous game eventually came to Steam in the form of the sparkly Director's Cut edition, we're guessing this will also make its way to our thundering beastrigs. Not sure if it too will be hobbled by the slightly irritating need to have a PSN account, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement">the first game did</a>. We never did get around to reviewing it, but James did report that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-runs-well-on-steam-deck-making-its-psn-nonsense-all-the-more-annoying">it runs quite well on the Steam Deck</a>. </p>
<p>We're promised more details in the months to come "including details about Atsu’s journey and the people (and animals) she’ll meet along the way." Putting this parenthetical mention of animals together with the wolf in the above trailer, and I'm guessing our killer has some affinity with wildlife that will come in handy somehow. Atsu herself will be played by voice actor Erika Ishii, aka Valkyrie from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, aka Dr Wenjie from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>, aka the female player character Rook from the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last year we reported horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> would be getting a couple of expansions. We've already had one of these in the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-is-getting-a-three-episode-night-springs-expansion-tomorrow">Night Springs</a>. And Edwin noted that the other would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-new-game-and-dlc-plans-include-what-can-only-be-a-control-crossover">probably be a crossover</a> with Remedy's other big game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a>, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. </p>
<p>The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful "altered items" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.</p>

<p>The DLC is "set in an eerie new location on the shores of Cauldron Lake," say the developers, and runs parallel to the main story. It'll see you guiding FBC agent Kiran Estevez through the Lake House research station, "where reckless experiments have caused reality to collide with the Dark Place." Agent Estevez appeared as a character in Alan Wake 2 - a busybody who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUo2p8fbSkQ">rudely takes over the investigation</a> of player character Saga. Her name also pops up in <a href="https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Shaded_Specimen_Captured">briefly in some documents</a> in Control. </p>
<p>The trailer shows a hallway full of bodies, and a twisted painting that screams in an anguished voice: "Murderer! Pain! Misery! Hatred!" All right, calm down Mr Painting. What is this, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/layers-of-fear">Layers Of Fear</a>? Get over yourself.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is a "stylistic tour de force and one of the most unique and confident horror games in recent years," said Katharine (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-review">our review</a>. But she also noted that "the climax to Saga and Alan's story does drop the ball somewhat in its very final moments. Enough is resolved to not feel like it's a complete disappointment, but it also leaves just enough hanging in the air to feel faintly unsatisfying at the same time."</p>
<p>Maybe this second spooky slap of DLC will tie up some loose intestines. But if I know my weird storytelling rules, it'll stubbornly refuse to make everything <em>too</em> neat. </p>
<p>Remedy recently paired up with Annapurna to finance Control 2 and to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">produce TV and film adaptations</a> set in their cross-pollinating world of funnyscares. It's possible this publishing deal may be negatively affected by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">recent trouble at Annapurna Interactive</a>, where the entire staff resigned in what increasingly looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactive-has-splintered-into-two-groups-both-of-which-are-now-working-to-pick-up-the-pieces-says-new-report">a management power struggle</a>. Annapurna themselves <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/451240/control-2-remedy-annapurna-interactive-resignations">say otherwise</a>, though it certainly can't be helping.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You read that right – Battlestate Games has produced a line-up of exclusive merchandise it’ll be selling during the Tokyo Game Show, and one item on that list is a Shturman ‘waifu’ body pillow. It’ll set you back 10,000 yen – around $70 – and depicts an ‘anime girl’ dressed as Shturman and lying on a bed.</p>



<p>You will be judged if you buy this.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stupid-sexy-shturman">Stupid Sexy Shturman</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games revealed a whopping line-up of merchandise dubbed the ‘Tokyo Limited Edition’ line. It set the community ablaze, as at first glimpse, it seems it’s only available if you’re attending the Tokyo Game Show, which effectively alienates the rest of the world.</p>



<p>If you’re attending TGS, you can purchase items like framed prints, exclusive t-shirts, dog tags, figurines, stickers, tote bags, replica in-game items like keycards, and yes, a Shturman body pillow.</p>



<p>Here’s the full selection:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘anime waifu’ theme continues with acrylic cut-outs featuring female representations of The Goons, the trio of bosses that roam several maps in Escape from Tarkov. More regional-specific items such as a foldable fan and Japanese tea bags are available.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games typically goes big at conventions and gaming expos. During Gamescom 2023, the company set up a huge booth for Escape from Tarkov Arena, which was being released just months later. Earlier in 2024, the firm appeared at the last Insomnia Gaming Festival event in the United Kingdom, once again presenting a themed and immersive Arena experience.</p>



<p>Are you mad that you’re missing out on this merchandise, and do you hope that Battlestate Games makes it available to purchase after the Tokyo Game Show? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Something magical occurred to me this morning: fit-flaying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Monster Hunter Wilds will be the first time I get to play a Monster Hunter game while also being a cat dad. It’s going to great! “What’s that, eh?!” I’ll say, pointing to a Doshaguma in a manner that might foolishly suggest I expect her to give a damn. “Mraow”, she’ll reply, knock over my coffee, then go back to sleep. “It’s you!” I’ll exclaim, pointing to the Palico I’ve spent six hours making look just like her. “That looks nothing like me, you odorous lummox,” she’ll insinuate with a cocked eyebrow, then go shout at an ant for a bit.</p>
<p>Ah well, at least I have videogames - this one is out on the 28th of Febwar, 2025. Here’s a trailer from last night’s Sony-me-doo:</p>

<p>As expected, it looks vast and beautiful, although I’m still deeply disturbed by the choice to have the Palico’s speak human language. I was such a fan of their silly cat puns that I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-cat-jokes-and-beast-names-of-monster-hunter-world-are-translated-into-english">interviewed the localisation team</a> a while back, and I’m just not convinced they’ll hit quite the same spoken out loud. Also present is the series’ traditional “this creature whose territory we’ve just invaded to carve it up for parts is somehow hostile towards us. Plucky heroes, assemble!” which I wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review">about here</a>, but that’s par for the course by now. I’m past the point of trying to take Monster Hunter stories at all seriously - I simply wish to bonk a large lizard.</p>
<p>Misgivings aside, I’m a mark for the monst, and perhaps an even bigger mark for the RE Engine, so I cannot wait to stick my face in this, much like my cat has started sticking her face into the saucepan of boiled egg water when there’s <strong>fresh water right there</strong>, you tiny criminal. Our Edwin was privy to a demo for Wilds earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">you can find here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-release-date-of-february-28-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release date announcement</a> and pre-order opening for Monster Hunter Wilds, CAPCOM has also shared the game's system requirements for the PC version on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. An SSD is required, Microsoft's DirectStorage API is supported, and Frame Generation is listed as part of the Recommended spec.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows®10 (64-bit Required)</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel® Core™ i5-10600 or Intel® Core™ i3-12100F or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1660 Super(VRAM 6GB) or AMD Radeon™ RX 5600 XT(VRAM 6GB)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</li>
<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>&nbsp;SSD required. This game is expected to run at 1080p (upscaled from 720 native resolution) / 30 fps under the "Lowest" graphics setting. DirectStorage supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows®10 (64-bit Required)</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel® Core™ i5-11600K or Intel® Core™ i5-12400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600X or AMD Ryzen™ 5 5500</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2070 Super(VRAM 8GB) or NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 4060(VRAM 8GB) or AMD Radeon™ RX 6700XT(VRAM 12GB)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</li>
<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>&nbsp;SSD required. This game is expected to run at 1080p / 60 fps (with Frame Generation enabled) under the "Medium" graphics setting. DirectStorage supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Frame Generation tidbit is interesting because the RTX 2070 Super does not support NVIDIA's DLSS 3 technology. However, CAPCOM might simply be taking into account that the RTX 2070 Super can enable AMD's FSR 3 instead. If that's the case, the requirements are rather hefty, as the Recommended spec only targets 1080p@60FPS with FG enabled and Medium graphics settings.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds runs on the RE Engine, which has generally proven to be rather lightweight. However, the first open-world game, Dragon's Dogma 2, definitely had more performance issues than the previously released linear games. The upcoming installment in the Monster Hunter franchise also uses open-world design.</p>

<p>Metro Awakening is an upcoming VR game that expands on the well-established post-apocalyptic franchise with an all-new, original story. It’s expected to be released before the year is out, giving players on PC, PlayStation, and Meta Quest the opportunity to explore a harrowing, mutant-ridden adventure from a terrifyingly close perspective.</p>



<p>I had the opportunity to play a solid trial of Metro Awakening at Gamescom in August. If I hold my hands up, it was one of the first VR games I’d ever played, but days after I experienced Metro Awakening, I’d invested in a Meta Quest 3.</p>



<p>Do with that information what you will.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-deep-deep-down">Deep, Deep Down</h2>



<p>Metro Awakening is set in 2028, around seven years before the events of Metro Exodus, the last main game in the series that was released back in 2019. Players assume control of Serdar, a survivor of the nuclear apocalypse and now a resident of Moscow’s dank, horrifying subway ecosystem.</p>



<p>As Serdar, players will venture through the underground catacombs and tunnels, searching desperately for his wife in a race against time to save her life. It’s a quintessential Metro adventure rife with mutant creatures, slim-to-nil resources, and darkness and danger lurking around every turn.</p>



<p>The first thing that struck me as a long-time Metro fan was the authenticity of the game. It has been compiled by Vertigo Games, and the team has done a fantastic job representing the inherent intensity of a Metro game in VR form. From the moment I passed through the game’s tutorial section and was plunged into the metro system of Moscow, I was <strong>immersed</strong>.</p>



<p>On the artistic front, it looks remarkably similar to Metro Exodus, right down to the clarity of the visuals. I’ve played a few VR games since then but nothing has managed to come close to the sheer atmosphere presented in Metro Awakening. It has been compiled so well that the version I played could have been packaged up and released to the market then and there.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-generation-horror">Next-Generation Horror</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you’ve ever been creeped out by some of the more eerie elements of the Metro series, prepare to have your timbers well and truly shivered in Metro Awakening. I was jumpscared by mutants, crawled on by giant spiders, and forced to confront a suffocating darkness with nothing but a flickering torch and a homemade lighter in my hands.</p>



<p>Everything from inventory mechanics to how you use weapons and equipment feels intuitive and natural in Metro Awakening. I got to grips with it after little more than a few minutes, and the attendant at the booth was surprised I’d essentially never played a VR game before.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how true to the franchise Metro Awakening remains. It helps that it has always been an immersive FPS series, but the VR perspective takes things one step further, planting you as close to the post-apocalyptic world as you’d ever want to be. I found myself probing every nook and cranny, opening every box and locker, and constantly checking my weapons and equipment to make sure I was in tip-top shape.</p>



<p>I haven’t been able to confirm how long the game is, but I’d assume it’s at least a few hours long. Beyond the launch of the game, I’m also not sure what’s coming next, but as soon as I have that information, I’ll happily share it. I’m hoping it doesn’t end the base game, because Metro Exodus had some fantastic expansions.</p>



<p>If you’ve been waiting for a solid new VR shooter, don’t sleep on Metro Awakening. It’s phenomenal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/console-us-spending-declines-ghost-of-tsushima-resurgence-validates-sonys-pc-strategy/">Ghost of Tsushima</a> was one of the most popular games released in 2020, with the game being nominated for an immense amount of awards, as well as winning a fair amount of them. Today, the sequel, Ghost of Yotei, was showcased in the State of Play, which takes players to a brand new era of Japan. While Ghost of Tsushima took place during the first Mongol invasion of Japan, which took place in 1274, Ghost of Yotei is moving things along in time and taking players to 1603, the Sengoku period of Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei will take place in the area surrounding Mount Yotei, which is located in modern-day Hokkaido, which was known as Ezo during the Sengoku period. Atsu is the protagonist of this game, and immediately, the gameplay looks very familiar in this new trailer. Players will get to enjoy features that were an essential part of Ghost of Tsushima, such as horseback riding and plenty of swordfights. While Atsu is exploring in the trailer, she has a Shamisen across her back, and there are plenty of features of a wolf, possibly her pet.</p>
<p>The game is shaping up to take players through grasslands, tundras and other dangers that players will have to try and navigate safely. Much like Tsushima, players will get to explore a new region of Japan and admire the beauty at their own pace.</p>
<p>For Sucker Punch, this is their first game that is built from the ground up for PlayStation 5, with huge improvements and features to the aesthetics and world-building, such as believable movement on wind on grass and vegetation, skyboxes filled with stars and auroras, as well as new mechanics, gameplay improvements and new weapons for players to utilize and experiment with.</p>
<p>All of these statements are explained in the<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a> that was posted on the PlayStation website by Andrew Goldfarb, who is the Communications Manager at Sucker Punch Productions.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ghost of Yotei doesn't have a specific release date, but it will be released sometime during 2025. Hopefully, players will get to see Ghost of Yotei arrive on PC later in the future, the same way Ghost of Tsushima did with the Director's Cut of the game.</p>

It will launch in Early Access via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3103780/DRAPLINE/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in spring 2025, with ENglish, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese language support. <span id="more-917293"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ The Author’s Comments Have Arrived for the First Non-Adventure Game in a While! We Are Working Hard to Get It Ready for Early Access Next Spring!</strong></p><p><em>DRAPLINE</em>, the game recently published on the Steam store, is the latest non-adventure-style game from indie game developer Kanawo. Kanawo is known for developing highly talked- about <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,772 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> such as <em>Noel the Mortal Fate</em>, which has been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, and the game version of Sanrio Company, Ltd.’s buzzworthy <em>MaiMai Maigoen</em>. This new title marks Kanawo’s return to non-adventure style games after a long period.</p><p>The game falls into the roguelite genre with strong nurturing game elements. Despite a short playtime of about one hour to reach the final boss, it offers a wide variety of strategies and developments based on each player’s nurturing approach. It aims to be a game that can be easily and repeatedly played multiple times. Note: “Adventure,” in the context of Japanese gaming, typically refers to <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [462 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a>-style games.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DRAPLINE_2024_09-25-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Moreover, this game is being developed with the goal of releasing it as a work in progress, allowing early access players to participate in its development. The aim is to start Early Access early next year (planned for spring). Furthermore, at the time of the full release scheduled for next year, the game is planned to support Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese languages.</p><p>The following is a comment from the game developer, Kanawo:</p><p>“It’s been over 10 years since I first released a game I made myself. In recent years, I’ve focused on creating adventure games like <em>Noel the Mortal Fate</em> that immerse players in a single story. However, this new game aims to be something I’d want to buy on Steam right now—a game that can be played repeatedly in short sessions, where you can enjoy building your own strategies and builds, and that has various endings. I’m developing this game with a fresh feeling, as if returning to my roots from 10 years ago, and I’m incredibly excited about it every day!</p><p>“Currently, I’m working on about the first third of the game while verifying core functions and parameters. I’m also releasing development versions exclusively to supporters on pixivFANBOX. The feedback from those who have played the current version in advance has been excellent, and I personally feel very positive about it. Above all, I’m having an incredible amount of fun developing it.</p><p>“Eventually, I’d like to release a demo version more widely and conduct an Early Access on Steam to receive feedback from more users, actively adjusting balance and adding features. After the Early Access begins next spring, I plan to frequently update Steam news with each update, so please add it to your Steam wishlist and stay tuned!”</p><p><strong>Game Description</strong></p><p>A calamity threatening the world is imminent… Raise the starving baby dragon you happened to find into your very own strongest dragon daughter!

            <link>https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-gets-teaser-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-gets-teaser-trailer.991317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-gets-teaser-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The expansion Alan Wake 2: The Lake House was unveiled today during the September 2024 State of Play. Fans got a first look at the upcoming expansion in a trailer released by Remedy. Fans already expected this expansion to be released sometime in October, and this was confirmed once again, albeit with no specific date. Furthermore, a more detailed synopsis for fans to dive into. While the trailer didn't expose too many details, it became obvious that the story centered around the Federal Bureau of Control, with the station being set inside the Lake House.</p>
<p>Instead of playing as Alan Wake, this time, you'll be playing as Kiran Estevez, an FBC agent, as the story takes place parallel to the main game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 – The Lake House Expansion Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHfs75K-y4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House is clearly linked to Remedy's other major franchise, Control, as part of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-qa-sam-lake-on-the-remedy-connected-universe-and-moving-toward-open-world-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a> (which will now be expanded into film and television following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with Annapurna Pictures</a>).</p>
<p>The previous Alan Wake 2 DLC, Night Springs, featured three episodes with three different protagonists, one of whom was Control's main character, Jesse Faden. Reviewer Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 8.5 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>While it does not offer much in terms of gameplay, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a worthy DLC to experience for all fans of the base game and Remedy Entertainment's titles. Free from the limitations imposed by the base game's narrative, which was fairly loose to begin with, Sam Lake and his team have gone all out to provide some extremely entertaining scenarios that, unfortunately, are over way too soon and leave the player wanting more. Hopefully, the next expansion, Lake House, will offer something a bit meatier to complement the masterful storytelling that is as well showcased in Night Springs as it is in the base game.</em></p>

With only seven days left before his soul fades away, can he save her in time? Transport yourself to feudal Japan in the last years of the Edo period, and experience a tale of rain and reincarnation, brought to life with striking new 2D visuals.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Aihama, Japan. The final years of the Edo period. One rain-drenched evening, a group of men burst into the town’s brother and sister-run umbrella shop. Yushin is cut down in front of his sister Yui, leaving her alone in the world. The next thing he knows, he is looking down at his own stricken corpse—a soul without a body. The grim incident shatters the peace in this quiet backwater. Lurking beneath the surface is an intricate, deep-rooted plot, shrouded in mystery. Until Yui is safe, not even death is enough to extinguish Yushin’s soul. He’ll stop at nothing on his quest, shifting from body to body, possessing anyone and anything to rescue his sister. But with just seven days before his soul departs this world—can he save Yui in time?</p><p>This is a tale of rain, reincarnation, and revenge.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Soul-Shifting Showdowns</strong> – Lacking a physical form, you’ll need to shift your soul to other bodies on the quest to find your sister. Possession puts you in complete control of whoever and whatever you inhabit, giving you access to a variety of weapons and fighting styles. Depending on your current body, you’ll face different foes and encounter new faces on your incorporeal journey.</li><li><strong>Inclement Intrigue</strong> – This human drama plays out against the rain-soaked backdrop of mid 19th century Japan, rendered in an evocative pixel style. In the sombre world of AMEDAMA, beauty and darkness are two sides of the same coin.</li><li><strong>Reincarnation, Repercussions</strong> – As you relive the same seven day period over and over again, your choices will impact the story unfolding around you. Who will you speak to? How will you intervene? The decisions, and the outcomes, are all up to you.</li><li><strong>Counteraction Using the Sword Technique of Usetsu Tensei Sword Style</strong> – Where Yushin, having mastered the key to battles, employs the technique known as ‘Misty Riposte.’ By countering the opponent’s attacks, significant damage is dealt in a counteraction.</li></ul><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Development / Marketing:</strong> IzanagiGames</li><li><strong>Planning:</strong> Acquire</li><li><strong>Character Design:</strong> lack (<em><a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/Grand Order</em>, <em>Touken Ranbu</em>)</li><li><strong>Soundtrack:</strong> Yuko Komiyama (<em><a title="Series > Monster Hunter [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> series)</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Certain Magic Circles can support a party of up to 16 characters. New effect spaces have also been added, expanding the variety of power-up combinations.</p><p>In battle, sub characters in the Magic Circle act as shields, absorbing damage in place of the main character. As long as the sub characters stay alive, the main character won’t take any damage.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_021.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_022.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_023.jpg"></a></figure><p>New Magic Circles are learned each time you level up, and the Magic Circles learned differ based on your class.

                <p dir="ltr">PlayStation unveiled multiple new controllers and PS5 console covers during the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a> presentation. Most notably, Fortnite is getting its own limited-edition DualSense on November 7. It has a blue color scheme and graffiti-style decals inspired by the game. PlayStation also unveiled its new Chroma Collection, which gives three DualSense colors and matching console covers a flashy chrome finish.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fortnite controller certainly stands out with a chaotic design that's the complete opposite of the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-preorder/1100-6525376/" data-ref-id="1100-6525376">Astro Bot controller</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DC7WHMZ2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold out</a>). Nevertheless, it's a limited-edition DualSense controller themed around Fortnite, so it will likely sell out fast when preorders go live October 3. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372401-fortniteds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372401" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372401-fortniteds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372401"></a><figcaption>Fortnite DualSense</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372401-fortniteds.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Aside from the Fortnite theming, the controller is otherwise the same as other standard DualSense controllers, complete with features like haptic feedback, dynamic triggers, touchpad, and gyro controls. PlayStation recently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJSY6961?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">raised the price of DualSense controllers by five bucks</a>, and the Fortnite controller reflects this change with an $85 list price. The Astro Bot controller only costs $80 (if you can find it), probably because preorders were already available when the increase went into effect. Going forward, limited-edition DualSense controllers will likely cost $85.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr">More Fortnite controllers</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372403-fortpads.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372403" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372403-fortpads.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372403"></a><figcaption>PowerA's official Fortnite edition controllers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372403-fortpads.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Cloud-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D8T84XZ7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA OPS V1 Wireless Controller - Fortnite Edition (PC, Mobile)</a> -- $55</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5K4WGC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller - Peely Edition (Switch)</a>-- $65</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Xbox-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D8T8QQ9S?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA Wireless Xbox Controller - Fortnite Special Edition (Xbox, PC, Mobile)</a>-- $100 | Releases October 1</li></ul><p>If you're interested in the Fortnite DualSense controller but aren't able to get one when preorders go live, there are new and upcoming third-party wireless gamepads with official Fortnite themes for Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We got the first look during today's livestream. </h2></div><section><p>Ghost of Tsushima is officially getting a sequel titled Ghost of Yotei, it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-announcements">confirmed during today's Sony State of Play presentation</a>. It'll arrive sometime in 2025.</p><p>It was the big announcement to close out the State of Play, and one of the biggest surprises. Developer Sucker Punch showed off a significant look at footage too, including some gorgeous cinematics. And if you couldn't glean from the title, it'll focus on a different setting and a brand-new protagonist, Atsu, moving away from Ghost of Tsushima's Jin Sakai. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Sucker Puncher didn't reveal too much during the presentation, but we got a little more insight thanks to a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> shortly after. It'll take place in 1603, 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, in the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei, known as Hokkaido today. Sucker Punch calls it "a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima, and it’s the setting for an original story we can’t wait to tell."</p><p>According to the post, the developer "wanted to maintain the core pillars established in Ghost of Tsushima: playing as a wandering warrior in Feudal Japan, offering freedom to explore at your own pace, and highlighting the beauty of the world."</p><p>"We also wanted to continue to innovate. To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," the post continues. "At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend. This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-3-blogroll-1727219402294.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei, will arrive in 2025. </figcaption></figure></output><p>As "Sucker Punch’s first game built from the ground up for PlayStation 5," it'll also include new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and new weapons. </p><p>Unabashedly inspired by the works of Akira Kurosawa (to the point where the game even included a "Kurosawa Mode") and other samurai films, Ghost of Tsushima followed a samurai on a quest to protect Tsushima Island during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. It released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2020 followed by a multiplayer mode, Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, that October. A Director's Cut was released for PS4 and PS5 in 2021, and a PC port finally arrived last year.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-from-john-wick-director-in-development">Ghost of Tsushima movie is also in the works</a> with Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with John Wick director Chad Stahelski set to direct.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">IGN gave Ghost of Tsushima a 9/10</a> back in 2020, calling it "an absolutely gorgeous adventure through one of history’s most strikingly beautiful landscapes, and that beauty is compounded by one of the best blade-to-blade combat systems the open-world action genre has seen."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ghost of Yotei Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.
