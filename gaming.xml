Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's Randy Pitchford's response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to Pitchford’s tweet has been mostly negative. “I am going to pirate Borderlands 4,” said one X / Twitter user. “Please stop. Just apologize and move on. This isn't fair on your developers. If you care about them, just do the right thing dude,” added another. “Randy we are begging you to stop. BL4 had so much hype and it’s being ruined in a day. Let people want to like and support the game and all the amazing people who made it,” said one commenter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Pitchford has yet to apologize directly for his comments, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-to-80-borderlands-4-if-youre-a-real-fan-comment-randy-pitchford-points-to-previous-statement-if-you-want-the-truth-here-it-is"><u>he did point to</u> a recent answer he gave on-stage at PAX East on Borderlands 4's price</a>, saying: “If you want the truth, here it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, Pitchford inched closer to an <em>actual</em> apology after <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1925249239149412373" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borderlands streamer Moxsy tweeted</a> dialogue from a Handsome Jack AI prompted by a user called Duke_Newcombe who fed it Pitchford's original tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Handsome Jack is the main antagonist of Borderlands 2 and self-appointed dictator of Pandora.)</p><blockquote>Ohhh boo-hoo, $80 for Borderlands 4? Let me break out the world’s tiniest violin—crafted from Eridium and oiled with the tears of whiny Vault Hunters.</blockquote><blockquote>Listen, cupcake, you’re not buying a game. You’re investing in a premium, galaxy-shattering experience personally engineered to blast your sad little dopamine receptors into orbit. You think quality loot and chaotic mayhem just code itself? You want guns that sprout legs, sing sea shanties, and explode into loot goblins without paying top dollar? Grow up.</blockquote><blockquote>Back in my day, I built an entire moonbase with my own two hands (and a metric ton of disposable Hyperion interns), and you’re crying about spending a few bucks more to virtually murder skags with style? Puh-lease.</blockquote><blockquote>But hey, if $80 is too steep, there’s always a solution: just don’t buy it. More legendary drops for the rest of us, and fewer mouth-breathing freeloaders clogging up my loot pools. Win-win.</blockquote><blockquote>Stay broke, hero.</blockquote><blockquote>•⁠Handsome Jack President of the Galaxy, CEO of Hyperion, and your personal nightmare</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/pitchford-1747909471374.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford: "Back to work for me!"

My bad, but cheers to Duke_Newcombe and @MoxsyOG for the funniest thing I’m going to read today!” <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925396048828404016" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In seriousness though, nobody likes being taken for granted and it was not my intent. I’m humbled by the love and support everyone has shown the team as we push hard to get this amazing game in your hands. They’re crushing it, and I can’t wait for everyone to play what’s going to be the best Borderlands ever! Regardless of where the price lands, it’s going to be worth it and then some. Back to work for me!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford, clearly, would like to draw a line under this week’s self-inflicted drama, but it seems likely the debate about Borderlands 4’s price will resurface as soon as pre-orders go live. At that point, publisher 2K Games will have to announce the price of the game, and whether it’s $80 or $70 or something else, it will be a bigger talking point now than it might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Monica Schipper/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Hot off the heels of his turn as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison in A Minecraft Movie, Jason Momoa is reportedly in talks to star in another video game adaptation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/street-fighter-movie-eyes-jason-momoa-noah-centineo-more-1236407261/">Deadline</a> sources, Momoa is currently in talks for a role in Legendary’s live-action Street Fighter movie, based on Capcom's fighting series. As for who Momoa may be playing should these talks prove successful, that for now remains unknown.</p>
<p>As well as Momoa, Andrew Koji (Bullet Train), Noah Centineo (Warfare) and WWE wrestler Roman Reigns (Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) are all said to be in talks for the Street Fighter adaptation.</p>

<p>Back in February of this year, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-gets-new-director-still-set-for-2026">Kitao Sakurai would direct the upcoming Street Fighter film</a>, with Capcom "deeply involved" in the adaptation as well.</p>
<p>The film is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">set for a release next year</a>, on 20th March, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">first been announced back in 2023</a>. Further details for now remain thin on the ground, but it sounds like production could soon be ramping up, so stay tuned for more. Personally, I would love to see cameos from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue (but I am not holding my breath).</p>
<p>As for Momoa, well, he is probably riding high on the success of A Minecraft Movie right now. The live-action adaptation, which also starred Jack Black, became a meme-filled hit on its release in April. The film generated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>, and has been such a success that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">there are already talks about a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-nintendo-switch-2-ports-are-reportedly-in-the-works-and-will-be-revealed-soon.1196079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ports of Xbox games for Nintendo Switch 2 are currently in the works, and their reveal should be imminent, according to a new online report.</p>
<p>The Verge's Tom Warren confirmed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory">recent report</a> focused on the announcement of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced, which is launching on PlayStation 5 this Summer, that Microsoft is also working on some Xbox ports for Nintendo Switch 2, which he expects will be revealed soon. Reliable leaker NateTheHate also said the same on X, so we should probably expect to see the announcement of the first few ports in the coming weeks during the "non-E3" season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Next up: Xbox games coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925234110588473837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Microsoft already having released ports of Xbox games on the original Nintendo Switch, such as Sea of Thieves and Grounded, it's not surprising to learn that more games will be coming to the next-generation system, which promises to be extremely successful at launch. As for which Xbox games could hit the Nintendo Switch 2, no one can say at the moment, but it's been previously rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> will launch on the system. Seeing the latter run on Nintendo Switch 2 would be quite interesting from a technical standpoint, as the game can be quite demanding, although if Asobo Studio managed to get the game running on Xbox Series S, it will definitely be possible to scale the game to the Switch 2 hardware capabilities, which may be better than anticipated, judging from how <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Cyberpunk 2077 runs on the system.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sedap! A Culinary Adventure Review - Sweet and Sour]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sedap-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sedap-a-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour.1196076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sedap-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing that video games need more of, it’s cooking-related games. I don’t mean the mini-games where you throw a bunch of ingredients and use them to buff your main character’s stamina or whatever, I mean games that focus entirely on the food. There’s something so comforting and satisfying about being able to virtually plate up a bowl of food. Perhaps it’s the fact that I don’t have to clean up afterwards or worry about storing the leftovers.</p>

<p>Of course, the bulk of cooking games revolve around serving burgers, pizzas, and salads. While I do love those foods, as a south asian, I do have to ask, “Where’s the rice?” <em>Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</em> answers that question with much cheer. A name that means ‘delicious’ in Malay, Sedap! is an action-adventure co-op cooking game much along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/overcooked-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Overcooked</em></a>, but with some extra toppings.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250514232339_1.jpg?itok=L7VMn5rr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250514232339_1.jpg?itok=b7i83I5M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What's Cooking?</h2>

<p><em>Sedap!</em> follows Som and Gon, aspiring restaurateurs who are looking to expand their culinary horizons. They come across the Makanomicon, a recipe book filled with new recipes. Filled with excitement and curiosity, the duo decides to start a food truck and set out for Khaya Island, an abandoned archipelago brimming with ingredients, monsters, and mysteries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, I had to put my relationship with my partner to the test, so while I played as Som, whose strength lies in cooking, my partner played as Gon, the skilled hunter. While both characters are capable of cooking and combat, we quickly learned that we would have to capitalize on each character’s strengths and optimize accordingly. After a few levels, we built a good rhythm where one would venture out and focus on getting ingredients while the other stayed back in the kitchen and served up dishes.</p>

<p>Each level adds a new recipe for you to learn from the Makanomicon, so naturally, the game gets progressively harder. The cooking process is mostly a series of button-mashing, with the final preparation of the dish being a QTE. If you fail it more than three times, you have to make the dish all over again. While on their own, they’re a breeze to get through, the pressure of delivering the dish on time is what will get to you. To my chagrin, I ended up fumbling a few times due to the sheer amount of orders piling up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250520141753_1.jpg?itok=_i5F-r63 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250520141753_1.jpg?itok=l1v27TOH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To fetch your ingredients, you’ll have to weed your way through enemies and obstacles. <em>Sedap!</em> features simple hack-and-slash combat. You can buy new weapons and charms to alter your stats, and some weapons even unleash a special ability when you charge the attack. You have a health bar, of course, so when you’re knocked out, you need to be revived by your teammate or you have to wait for a few seconds.</p>

<p>At the end of the level, you’ll be rated based on how many dishes you successfully delivered in time, and you’re even granted a bonus based on the freshness of the food as well as how fast you were. You also get to see customer reviews, which, I gotta say, they’re pretty realistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game slowly reveals more and more mechanics for you to keep in mind, some being hindrances, like a gate that can be only opened when someone stands on the switch, while others assist, like teletotems that allow you to transport items from one part of the area to another.</p>

<h2>Charm with a Side of Bugs</h2>

<p>In solo mode, you end up playing as both Som and Gon, and the game helps you out in switching between the two when it’s convenient. However, some of <em>Sedap’s</em> mechanics don’t really translate that well into the solo-player version. Your choice of weapon or charm that you choose to equip doesn’t really make all that much of a difference, since you get automatically swapped between the protagonists. Teletotems get rendered useless as you can still transport the item, but you still have to make the trek back to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250515001701_1.jpg?itok=OUzqwF-n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250515001701_1.jpg?itok=3ePCboh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game does adjust your health and the time you get to prepare a dish, but there isn’t anything unique to the solo mode, which makes it feel like an afterthought. Oddly enough, you can’t have separate save files, so if you do want to play solo, you have no choice but to start from the very beginning. In fact, even if you want to play local co-op, you start afresh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tested out both local co-op as well as online co-op while playing <em>Sedap!</em>&nbsp;My partner and I tried playing online, and although we were in the house using the same internet, we both experienced frequent disconnects. We decided to switch to local co-op, and though the connection was much more stable, we still encountered our fair share of bugs and controller disconnects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes the controls would get swapped around, and the X button would become the A button. Other times, the environment would just lock a character into a certain area, leaving us with no choice but to restart the level. Even the UI would sometimes be unresponsive to my controller, and I’d have to switch to keyboard and mouse just to change something in the settings.&nbsp;</p>

From the protagonists to the monsters, the designs are stinking adorable. As you’d expect from a cooking-based game, each dish looks like something I’d want to eat. The colours are warm and inviting, much like an actual kitchen. The clatter and clinking of woks and pots are a treat for the ears, especially paired with the game’s culturally infused soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts - Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</h2>

<p>In the shallow pool of cooking games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2650730/SEDAP_A_Culinary_Adventure/" rel="nofollow"><em>Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</em></a> stands proud with its Southeast Asian roots. It’s a genuinely fun game when you’re not faced with frequent disconnects and glitches. It still feels like a dish-in-progress, but if you’re willing to overlook a few hiccups, <em>Sedap!</em> is absolutely worth a try.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
I can’t be the only person here who’s ever had a fistfight with their washing-up. I have this big metal spatula that has a malicious habit of bouncing out of the drying rack. Again and again, it sneaks under my elbow to spring and sproing over the lino, gathering as much stray onion peel as it can on the way to the door. The fourth time this happened I bent it in two. Then I thought my sieve was giving me stinkeye, so I threw it down and stamped on it, gangland-style. Look, it was kind of a bad day. But one thing I will swear to you, probably-concerned reader: I would <em>never</em> behave this way towards my leftovers.

Any food I don’t finish is placed in fresh Tupperware, carefully dated in black marker, and slotted into the fridge like a holy relic. Sometimes, I open the fridge just to behold my works. In this regard, I am unlike the burned-out white collar protagonist of Leftovers KO!, who opens his fridge one evening to find a hamburger that has gotten so mad at being mouldy it wants to beat his face in.
</p>
<p>
The hamburger is just the start of your troubles. There’s a positively Satanic slice of stale pizza in the living room, a manky, musclebound… artichoke? I think? in the pantry, and a rabid stick of celery in the bedroom. In the absence of a compost bin, all these putrid hand-drawn foodstuffs must be pummelled into submission, using a combat system inspired by Nintendo Entertainment System classic Punch-Out.</p>
<p>You will dodge, block, punch and haymaker while trying not to run out of stamina. I found the demo quite tricky: you’ll need to KO each oozing comestible several times, and they’ll come back harder every time they clamber to their feet. Along the way, you’ll learn new moves to master in the training room. There's support for keyboard or controller inputs and I'm equally terrible with both.
</p>
<p>
It’s all the work of Mountain Man Animation, with Feardemic publishing. Find the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169060/Leftovers_KO/">Steam</a>. The full game launches on 25th May which, coincidentally, is when I’m doing my next grocery run. Again, though, I must protest that I would never assault my own cooking, though many would consider my cooking an assault.

                <p>Elgato is introducing Stream Deck modules, the MK.2 Stream Deck, and new Virtual Stream Deck software. The Elgato Stream Deck, as the name suggests, was initially aimed at streamers as a way to quickly do things like manipulate on-screen stream elements without having to interrupt your stream by going to a separate app. Instead, a number of programmable buttons on the interface can be bound to certain apps, keybinds, and commands to achieve quick results, such as changing stream scenes or sending your audience to another creator's stream in a raid. It turns out, though, that there are lots of uses for such an idea.</p><p>Elgato's developer-friendly platform has long supported letting anyone do just about anything with a Stream Deck, but now it is looking to blow out that experience in a big way with its newest showings at Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3563" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module" data-collection="" title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato Stream Deck Module</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Stream Deck Module is a case of a company listening to its users and responding. Hobbyists have been ripping apart Stream Decks to use the buttons and front panel as parts of bigger projects, and the Module is for exactly those users. Available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and housed in an aluminum casing, these unbranded panels are intended to be integrated into those projects. The Module will be available for $49.99 for the six-key variant, $129.99 for the 15-key model, and $199.99 for 32-keys. </p>                      </div><p>Alongside the Modules, a $79.99 Stream Deck network dock will allow you to plug a Stream Deck in anywhere you have a network port, further opening the possibilities for use in things like smart home setups and other projects.</p><p>The MK.2 Stream Deck, available for $149.99, pushes things forward in a different way. If you've ever owned a Stream Deck--I use my six-key Stream Deck to control Spotify and switch audio devices--you know the keys can be kind of mushy. Since they're not meant to be used for typing, that's not so bad, but it can be hard to tell if you've actuated one of those keys.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvUcQNxSOGQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvUcQNxSOGQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The MK.2 swaps out the membrane beneath the current Stream Deck keys with scissor switches, which can be commonly found on laptop and other similarly low-profile keyboards. Elgato says this will provide "enhanced speed and precision," and "lends itself to typing-style interactions" that could pave the way for new Stream Deck use cases. Remember the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/popularis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Optimus Keyboard</a>, that striking keyboard that featured a screen on every key? It's not hard to imagine scissor switches allowing Elgato to move in the direction of making a full keyboard.</p><p>Finally, Elgato is bringing a software-only Stream Deck app to market for desktop systems. It's similar to the existing Stream Deck mobile app, which allows you to turn your phone or tablet into a soft Stream Deck. The software will be available at first to anyone with a physical Stream Deck, and will be bundled with the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse and Corsair Xenon Edge touchscreen--the Stream Deck 7.0 beta requires that you connect one of those devices for the VSD feature to be available. Notably, though, unlike its mobile equivalent, things like custom layouts and virtual faceplates won't be locked behind a paid subscription. Elgato says that the VSD software will be available with a greater range of hardware over time. We're also quite sure that no one is going to figure out a way to simulate owning a Stream Deck to make the software usable by anyone. No way at all.</p>

            <p>Bungie once considered a subscription model for its online shooter Destiny, but the idea was "vehemently shut down" by management.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> went free-to-play in 2019, but players need to pay for the most recent DLC expansions. There's also a store for paid cosmetics.</p>
<p>Other MMOs, such as World of Warcraft or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, run on a subscription model, where players pay a monthly fee for access. According to a new report, Bungie considered this but management decided against it.</p>

<p>The news comes as part of a report into the current state of Bungie, following word last week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">Bungie morale is in "free fall"</a> following the fallout of stolen assets used in its next game, Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">YouTuber and journalist Destin Legarie</a> has spoken to former employees this week. Bungie management were described as "toxic and shut down creatives on a core level", with one former employee stating: "If [management] didn't think of it, it wasn't worth doing."</p>
<p>In this context, when one employee brought up the possibility of a subscription model, it was reportedly "vehemently shut down".</p>
<p>In another example, management was concerned the glowing Trials of Osiris PvP armour was too attractive, which would impact sales of armours in the Eververse store. Decisions by management "prioritised monetisation over player experience", a former Bungie employee said. Another added: "Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed."</p>
<p>One former employee surmised: "Bungie's problems stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.</p>
<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">Bungie CEO Peter Parsons was criticised for spending millions of dollars on classic cars</a>. This news followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">a round of layoffs where 220 staff</a>, roughly 17 percent of the company's workforce, lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to including designs in Marathon without the artist's consent</a>. And this wasn't the first time Bungie had made this mistake.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">showed off Marathon back in April</a>. It's a PvP extraction shooter set to release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Embracer - the Swedish conglomerate which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">bought up and then proceeded to lay off countless studios and employees</a> - still plans to release "76 different games during FY 2025/26".</p>
<p>These games will be a mix of "new IPs, sequels, and remasters", according to the <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1077-million/">company's latest financial report</a>.</p>
<p>Upcoming releases from Embracer studios include Metal Eden, Gothic 1 Remake, Reanimal, Fellowship, Wreckreation, the next SpongeBob SquarePants game, Norse: Oath of Blood and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. Embracer also has a number of games it is yet to announce.</p>

<p>The company stated its AAA game releases "continue to be key financial drivers across specific years and quarters". It highlighted upcoming releases <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killing-floor">Killing Floor</a> 3 and Amy Hennig's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the latter of which is being developed by Skydance Games and published by Plaion. </p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was once tapped for launch some time around Christmas this year, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into 2026 in order to "add more polish"</a> and ensure players get "the best possible experience" on release.</p>
<p>"We are expecting Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra to drive notable revenues but to have lower margins due to shared economics with several other partners," Embracer wrote.</p>
<p>Embracer also alluded to a third AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this game will likely release the following fiscal year (I wonder if this is Tomb Raider).</p>
<p>"We expect this specific game to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nears-2m-sold-as-troubled-publisher-embracer-celebrates-success">financial dynamics more similar to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>," Embracer said.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In addition to releasing those 76 games in the coming year, Embracer will also spin off Coffee Stain Group into a standalone company by the end of 2025. </p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">Embracer announced its split into three companies</a>: Coffee Stain and Friends, Middle-earth Enterprises, and Asmodee Group. Now Coffee Stain, known for the likes of first-person open-world factory building game Satisfactory, will separate.</p>
<p>"This strategic move will allow Coffee Stain Group to focus on its core strengths as passionate game developers and publishers, focused on delivering high quality experiences," Embracer said.</p>
<p>Middle-earth Enterprises will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment as a result, and will unite "top creators and intellectual properties" to "build unforgettable experiences for the fans".</p>
<p>Said Embracer: "The strategy is to transform into one powerhouse group with game development and publishing at its core, complemented with transmedia capabilities within IP licensing, comics, merchandise, film and distribution."</p>
<p>After a huge acquisition spree several years ago, Embracer subsequently shed thousands of staff and shuttered studios such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition Games</a>, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">major $2bn investment fell through</a>.</p>
<p>More recently in March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Embracer-owned Eidos-Montréal announced it was laying off "up to" 75 members of staff</a>, saying it didn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The quality is good enough that, while scrolling on social media, you'd think it was a legimate clip from YouTube or Twitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically, Veo 3 should not be infringing on anyone's copyrighted material — and it's safe to assume Fortnite developer Epic Games did not sign this one off. But clearly the AI tool has had access to the millions of hours of Fortnite gameplay posted online, and is now able to reproduce a convincing representation on command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a>, showing a streamer celebrating as they win a match using only their pickaxe, was apparently created within Veo 3 using a text-based prompt of nine words: "Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Uhhh... I don't think Veo 3 is supposed to be generating Fortnite gameplay <a href="https://t.co/bWKruQ5Nox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bWKruQ5Nox</a></p>— Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In writing this prompt, Veo 3 has not been told specifically to create Fortnite gameplay. Still, it understands from the context what game the user is referring to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veo 3's abilities throw up all sorts of questions, and far more pressing ones than simple copyright concerns. The ability to create footage like this undoubtedly aids users looking to fool others with disinformation, and in so doing undermine trust in legitimate footage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can not tell if this is real or not," reads one reply. "We're cooked," reads another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only way this is possible is if Veo 3 was trained on an enormous amount of Fortnite content," a third reply reads. "Wouldn’t be surprised if everything that gets uploaded to YouTube is now being trained on despite copyright laws."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a better look at what Veo 3 is capable of outside of video games, here's a clip of the algorithm creating a fake news report on an automobile trade show that doesn't exist, with fake interviewees answering fake questions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Before you ask: yes, everything is AI here.

Jones' voice is officially licensed (and was previously used to create dialogue for Disney's own Obi Wan Kenobi TV series) and sanctioned by both the late actor and his family, but the addition still prompted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-union-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-fortnites-ai-darth-vader">swift condemnation and an unfair labor practice charge from acting union SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

If a code is in the active and working list, however, be sure to copy and paste it exactly as you see it here. We test each of the codes before uploading them, and Roblox codes are often case-sensitive, so it's important that it's exact. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lies of P Overture Director explains how the DLC will create a complete experience</p>
      </div>
<p>Once the update goes live alongside the Overture expansion, you will get to choose from two new gameplay difficulty options, Butterfly's Guidance and Awakened Puppet. The default difficulty level will be renamed to "Legendary Stalker" in the upcoming patch. For those of you looking for a greater challenge, will be able to take part in a boss rush mode that has several tiers of escalating difficulty. Additionally, the new Death March mode is a gauntlet of boss fights where your health and inventory will be more limited.</p><p>Difficulty options in souls-like games have been a polarizing topic for years now. Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer From Software typically refrains from adding such options to its games, while other studios allow a wider selection of options to make the experience more forgiving. Stellar Blade is a good example here, as the Sekiro-influenced game offers several difficulty modes and gameplay assists. On the extreme side, Steel Rising by developer Spiders has options that turns the game into a cakewalk.</p><p>Lies of P: Overture is expected to launch in summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Neowiz says you can expect it to take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-expansion-will-take-up-to-20-hours-isnt-related-to-that-cutscene/1100-6530393/">between 15-20 hours to complete</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-has-been-in-development-since-the-launch-of-the-first-switch-console/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> another episode of its Ask the Developer Series dedicated to upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games, and this time it's all about Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This could very well be the 'killer application' of the new console. Its predecessor, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-8-deluxe-best-kart-racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, launched shortly after the launch of the original Switch and was immediately a smashing success. The game has sold over 65 million units to date, becoming one of the best-selling premium titles of all time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kosuke Yabuki (Producer of the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department) revealed in this interview that prototyping on Mario Kart World started even before the predecessor launched on the Switch, while full development began later in 2017.</p>
<p><em>We were thinking about what to do for the next Mario Kart game even during the development of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and we began prototyping in March 2017. It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project. I felt that in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, we were able to perfect the formula that we'd been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses. That’s why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this.</em></p>
<p>It's an exceedingly long time to make a game by Nintendo's standards. However, the team has significant challenges to overcome, such as doubling the amount of players in a race from 12 to 24 while adding an open world. Everything became much more feasible once the decision was made to move the project to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kenta Sato (Programming Director):</strong> When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return. We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kosuke Yabuki:</strong> We worked on it while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy. But as we'd decided to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-booster-course-pass-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — Booster Course Pass</a>, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. That's when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.</em></p>
<p>Our Nathan Birch was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out Mario Kart World</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 press hands-on event and came away favorably impressed:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times. That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em></p>

        <p>The unbridled pungency of Butterfly's Guidance</p>

    </div>

            <p>
Which sounds like the more intense experience to you, dear reader - "Butterfly's Guidance" or "Awakened Puppet"? No, this isn't me workshopping titles for my latest range of exotic fragrances. I'm referring to the new easier difficulty modes Neowiz will add to Pinnochio-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> alongside the game's Overture DLC this summer.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty modes will arrive in a free Lies Of P update. The standard difficulty will be "Legendary Stalker", which honestly I think is a bit of a letdown, after "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet". It barely sounds like an exotic fragrance at all. Possibly you could peddle it as some kind of feline musk.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>, game director Jiwon Choi explained that "we wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," adding that the new modes are based partly on player feedback. "[By] making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players," he said. "This broadens the base."
</p>
<p>
This would be an obvious time to rekindle the debate about difficulty, accessibility, and the toxicity of "git gud" culture. Let me extend an avuncular arm and say: come now, friends, that debate is surely over. I think everybody agrees that giving players options that reflect their needs or preferences is fundamentally a good thing, and that there is no reason such options can't be consistent with, say, an atmosphere of abiding menace or a sense of gruelling challenge - after all, most video games and certainly, all mainstream commercial video games assist and guide players in myriad, subtle ways, even when you're playing on Mega-Bastard difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Instead, let's argue about appropriate difficulty mode naming. I have a feeling I've ranted somewhere about this before? Call me Johnny Obfuscation but I like it when developers clown around a bit with their nomenclature. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>'s European Extreme, for example, or Ready To Rhombus in <a href="http://adventuresofsquare.com/">The Adventures Of Square</a>. European Extreme is definitely some kind of abrasive cologne: it conjures up visions of dyed chest hair and revolting suede. Ready To Rhombus, meanwhile, sounds like a whimsical hemp-based aftershave with a handwritten label, sold exclusively in Camden Town.
</p>
<p>
Difficulty settings aside, Lies Of P is also getting a couple of new bossfight modes. In Battle Memories, you can replay bosses through five difficulty tiers. In Death March, you must fell as many bosses as possible with limited health and items. Again, it's all coming this summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this week, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines, when a comment he had made on social media started making the rounds online. The comment was in response to one potential Borderlands 4 buyer, who in a post on X said "this game better not be 80 dollars". Pitchford then gave a slightly tone deaf reply, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game no matter how much it cost</a>.</p>
<p>Pitchford's comment was met with a certain amount of backlash, and now the Gearbox head has shared another post in a bid to unmuddy the waters.</p>
<p>"If you want the truth, here it is," he wrote, with an accompanying video from an earlier interview where he was asked how much Borderlands 4 would retail for. Here, the Gearbox exec admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>

<p>"It's an interesting time, right," Pitchford said. "On one level, we've got a competitive market place. The people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price sensitive. So, there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are."</p>
<p>He went on to state that there are also "other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging" to consider.</p>
<p>"It's getting gnarly out there, guys," Pitchford said, adding Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of its series predecessor. He reiterated that he really doesn't know the price, but when pre-orders go live, that's when we will all know how much Borderlands 4 will cost.</p>
<p>"Here's the philosophy we have, whatever the price is: we're entertainers. Yes, we want to get more resources so we can make bigger and better games - there is a reason why Borderlands 4 is so awesome," the studio head went on. "It's because you guys showed up and supported <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>. And, we had the budget, we could more than double the budget and feel confident in that."</p>
<p>He said as a group of "artists", the studio wants everyone to be able to get their hands on Borderlands 4. "We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we are creating" and that everyone who plays a Gearbox game feels like they "got the better end of the bargain".</p>
<p>In the video, Pitchford said "we're going to have a price set soon, and it might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with</a>" or "it might be that we stay back". Either way, "it's going to be the people at the publishing house that decide that".</p>

In a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925396048828404016">subsequent post on X</a>, Pitchford addressed his earlier social media comment. </p>
<p>"In seriousness though, nobody likes being taken for granted and it was not my intent. I'm humbled by the love and support everyone has shown the team as we push hard to get this amazing game in your hands," he wrote. </p>
<p>"They're crushing it, and I can't wait for everyone to play what's going to be the best Borderlands ever! Regardless of where the price lands, it's going to be worth it and then some. Back to work for me!"</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to launch across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 12th September, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Take-Two announced it was bringing its release forward</a>. Borderlands 4 will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">introduce four new Vault Hunters</a> on its release, alongside a new horde known as the Rippers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/war-mechanic-weaves-an-intriguing-alternate-history-where-ww2-never-ended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Alternate histories often give us the most intriguing settings. Taking what we know and twisting it into a parallel timeline might result in the light-hearted antics of Back to the Future, or skew the world into a terrifying alternative vision of the past or future, bringing us prescient stories like A Handmaid’s Tale or exploring punishing alternatives like The Man in the High Castle.</p>
<p>War Mechanic pictures a world where World War 2 never ended. Here, the Soviets stole the plans to the atomic bomb, but, lacking the scientific might to bring it to fruition, it was never completed. Without that emphatic punctuation to the conflict, it rumbled on, and while the Nazis were dispatched, it ultimately became a war between the US and the Russians, with the US war machine led by now-President Patton.</p>
<p><iframe title="War Mechanic - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FydGoDMoiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Within that, War Mechanic takes you to Nordhook. This island-based military outpost has fallen into disrepair, and you’re tasked with pushing the US military front from this remote locale, with economic and technological might the order of the day. Starting off in the opening area for our hands-on session, War Mechanic sees you rebuild, repair and enhance your base of operations, so that you can then push further into the body of the island, unearthing secret tech, or collecting scrap to turn into useful items for the war effort.</p>
<p>Your main character, Jack, is focused, inquisitive and intelligent, making an interesting counterpoint to your weasel-like companion Bill, who oozes underhandedness like a cheap cologne. He’s the one transporting you to the island you’re going to call home for the foreseeable future, and there’s a nice bit of narrative drive to wash over you as the boat careens towards its goal.</p>


<p>War Mechanic has some real Bioshock and Fallout 4 vibes, and its alternate history setting is intriguing, throwing up a variety of questions about this unusual island and its mysteries. Given that both sides during the Second World War utilised island bases, and they’re interesting enough without populating them with killer spider robots and steampunk hardware, it feels as though the team have settled on a perfect setting for their narrative.</p>
<p>We talked to lead developer, Rafał Lewkowicz, who told us, “We like history! We like history a lot! That’s probably the basis for everything here.” It’s clear that the team at Chronospace have a very specific vision of this period of time, and they’re having lots of fun exploring the possibilities that it gives them, in terms of storytelling, and the technology that they’ve created in-game.</p>
<p>You’re equipped with a pistol from the outset, which is absolutely necessary to deal with the spider-like robot drones that have been left to defend the island. They’re a constant source of anxiety, and my favourite moments with them was seeing them scurry off behind a building in the distance, and carefully following in the hope that I could take them out before they ran straight up to me and exploded.</p>
<p>They will home in on your location, and you have to react quickly and decisively unless you want to lose a large chunk of your health. Fortunately, there are plenty of healing packs littered around in this opening area, but it’ll be interesting to see if these become rarer as you advance, ramping up the difficulty. One thing we do know from screenshots is that these spider-bots don’t stay small…</p>

<p>Alongside your pistol, you’ve got a burner, which is good for collecting coal down the mines as much as it is for melting down scrap that you can then turn into other things via the game’s crafting and upgrade mechanics. It doesn’t feel too much like busy work here, and finding a crashed plane blocking the middle of the road that you can then dismantle is plenty of fun.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the demo, you unlock an enhanced German car, and once you’ve found a blueprint and crafted the design, you can stick a handy machine gun on its roof, ideal for the sudden horde of spider-bots that come your way once they hear you. It’s nice to see the team giving players plenty of ways to explore the environment, though the opening area is perhaps slightly too constricted for racing around in your car.</p>

<p>The team tell me that there’s a later desert area, and it feels as though you’re going to get plenty of opportunity to careen across the sand dunes once you reach it, but it would be nice to let loose with the vehicle a little earlier here.</p>
<p>War Mechanic has settled on an intriguing moment in global history to craft its alternative history tale, and after our short time with the game, we’re already keen to see more.</p>
<p><em>War Mechanic is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2861090/War_Mechanic/">available to wishlist on Steam</a>, as the team build up to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chronospace/war-mechanic-explore-repair-automate">a Kickstarter crowdfunding project</a> in the near future.</em></p>

			<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-full-launch-scheduled-for-may-21-devs-want-to-bring-the-entirety-of-westeros-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, Netmarble has released Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-e19c7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and Windows Launcher) and mobile devices (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>) across the world with the exception of Asia, where the game will debut later in 2025. The action/adventure roleplaying game (powered by Unreal Engine 5) had previously debuted in early access exclusively on PC. Cross-play is enabled between PC and mobile, by the way, once you've linked the accounts.</p>
<p>The launch update added the new Stormlands region, the one ruled by Stannis Baratheon. Players will find new story missions and side content, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ferocious Beast</li>
<li>Bandit Camps</li>
<li>Echoes of the Past</li>
<li>Historic Sites</li>
<li>Occupied Sites</li>
<li>Gods Haven</li>
</ul>
<p>The level cap was raised from 40 to 45. Four new Artifacts (one Legendary, one Epic, and two Uncommon) have been added. New Achievements have been added for performing feats in the Stormlands as well as defeating the Unicorn and Drogon. Moreover, an emote system was added to Game of Thrones: Kingsroad and can now be accessed by selecting the emotes icon in the lower right corner of the chat window.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uNd9WH5QmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the official launch, Netmarble will gift players a random reward once per day through June 5. Potential rewards include x80 Golden Dragon, x1 Ruin Runner, x2,000 Copper, x10 Iron Ore, x1 Artifact Expedition Requisition, x3 Silver Ore, and x1 Enraging Draught Bundle. To claim the rewards, players must simply visit the Web Shop daily.</p>
<p>Over time, the developer has expressed the desire to add all the remaining regions to eventually bring all of Westeros to life. Of course, being a live service game at its core, it will largely depend on the game's success. If Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is popular enough, it may happen over time; otherwise, it could be shut down way before that happens.</p>

            <p>Borderlands boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">submitted an-all timer entry into the pantheon of neoliberal thirst tweets</a> earlier this week, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">telling a player concerned</a> about a potential $80 asking price for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> that "if you're a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen", before telling an anecdote about how, when he were a lad, he used to lick the fleas from unwashed goats for quarters to play Bubble Bobble, or something.</p>
<p>This went down about as well as you'd expect, prompting Pitchford to yesterday follow-up with a clip of him on a panel talking about a potential price increase in, wait for it, much more sober and considered terms. So, in the interest of not only reporting on Pitchford when he says something incredibly stupid (although, lets be real, only because it's related, I'm still muckraking here) <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">here's the clip</a>.</p>

<p>When asked about the game's price, Pitchford says he doesn't know. "It's an interesting time, right? We've got a competitive marketplace. We want people to buy it so we've got the resources to make more. The people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. We want everyone who buys and plays a Gearbox game to feel certain they got the better end of the bargain."</p>
<p>"Game budgets are increasing," he continues. "There's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget (of 3)". Then he veers off to talk about his philosophy of entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>There's surely debates to be had about some of the points Pitchford raises although, crucially, none of it puts the onus on "fans" to be "real" enough to go lick fleas from goats for pennies. Why didn't you just say all this in the first place, Pitchford? I understand Twitter is where nuance goes to die, but don't tell me that you're above long threads now. Also, no, having a character in Borderlands 4 reference your original tweet to reframe your idiot posting as a charming foible will not absolve you of this. Although it would at least be refreshingly recent as far as Borderlands references go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> will receive difficulty options in a free update due alongside its forthcoming DLC, Overture.</p>
<p>As a Soulslike game, Lies of P is certainly challenging. But the new difficulty options will ensure both the base game and the DLC are more approachable for newcomers.</p>
<p>"We wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," said game director Jiwon Choi (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>), adding the team had had "a lot of feedback" from players and the game's developers.</p>

<p>"So by making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players. This broadens the base."</p>
<p>The default difficulty for Lies of P will be named "Legendary Stalker", while two easier modes will be added named "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet".</p>
<p>If you're after even more challenge, though, the game is also receiving a Battle Memories mode where players can replay bosses through five tiers of difficulty, including ultra hard modes.</p>
<p>What's more, a Death March boss rush mode will challenge players to take down as many bosses as possible with a limited pool of health and items.</p>
<p>Both of these modes will have bespoke rewards yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture is a prequel to the base game that was initially teased in 2023 following the game's release, along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">confirmation a sequel is in development</a>. It was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-prequel-dlc-revealed-named-overture">officially revealed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>As a prequel, the DLC will follow the protagonist puppet during the final days of the city of Krat. It will feature new weapons such as slashing claws, a gunblade, and a ranged bow.</p>
<p>Lies of P: Overture will be released at some point this summer.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer spoke with Choi about FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director">Lies of P team is focused solely on creating a single-player game</a>.</p>
<p>"I've tried [Nightreign] and it was very refreshing and new," he said. "So that obviously gave me the impression that they're good developers, they always push their boundaries, their imagination and vision, and it shows. In turn, that for some reason motivated me to deliver the Overture experience as good as it could be."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dark Souls creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> has frequently discussed the high difficulty level of his games. Ahead of Elden Ring's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-discusses-elden-ring-difficulty">he stated it would be more approachable than previous games</a>, and then last year said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">turning down the challenge would "break the game itself"</a>.</p>
<p>Souls fans have long debated whether difficulty options should be included, but it's great to see other studios implementing what FromSoftware hasn't so far.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3231480/Dreamspring/">The Steam trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreamspring">Dreamspring</a> contains: shooting spiders with a revolver. Hanging out near a green ocean. Fighting green skeletons. Most curiously, it features an armoured knight convulsing on a bed as if being shocked, from the inside, by some sort of magical electricity disease. Did this knight eat an entire pack of bad batteries? Do batteries even exist in this world, described as "a realm in ruins…beneath a twilight sky". It's a damn hell ass bum mystery, and mystery is exactly what I want from a game that lists both Morrowind and King's Field as influences.</p>

<p>"As a spellsword gunslinger," - truly, the millionaire astronaut cowboy DJ of RPG classes  - "you'll explore ethereal landscapes shrouded in twilight, battle fearsome creatures, and uncover ancient secrets. Explore the dying Kingdom of Mortis and its different realms in first person action combat, in a world mixed with retro and vaporwave aesthetics".</p>
<p>Despite the FromSoft influence, Dreamspring is aiming to be "a less punishing type of Souls/Scrolls-like game," which I reckon is something that gets more important the bigger your world is. Otherwise, it looks to have most of the stuff you'd expect - branching dialogue, branching storyline, branching trees with branches branching toward an uncaring skyline, all the classics. It's in early access at the moment, with the "core loop" apparently done, and the main quest and world still being worked on.</p>
<p>There's no demo, although developer Billyfighter's previous game Necroslayer is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2563960/Necroslayer">roughly the price of Greggs' bake at the moment</a>. Will you feel good after playing it? I can't say. But you will likely feel better than after eating a Greggs' bake.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
