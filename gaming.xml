<p>Plus Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake gets new trailer</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a70ab0909dfec/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Intrepid adventurers, if you've been holding off on playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> and have a Switch 2, today's news might come as a nice little incentive.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoWsrW02ja4">during the Japanese Nintendo Direct</a>, Square Enix has dropped a free performance update for the excellent turn-based RPG. The update adds a new option in the game's Display settings, as well as gives the game an overall resolution bump. Oh, and it's out right now.</p>
<p>Now, you can choose between Performance Mode, where the game will run at 60fps but with slightly blurrier visuals (but much better than they are on Switch 1), or Graphics Mode, which gives you some gorgeously crisp visuals at the cost of the game running at 30fps. You can find details on the update <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq3/faq/en.html">on the official website</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/541d08c305ded/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No more choppy waters. Or pixels. — <em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not the only Dragon Quest news for today, however. We also got a brand new trailer for Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, which is coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 on 30th October.</p>
<p>One thing previous trailers have teased is the addition of a new character to Dragon Quest II, and we now know who that is — the Princess of Cannock. That means they're more than likely the sister to one of the other party members, the Prince of Cannock.</p>
<p>An English version of the trailer dropped earlier, so have a watch.</p>

<p>Unlike the free performance update for DQIII, I &amp; II is getting a native Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release. So far, Square Enix has said <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">there will be no upgrade path to the Switch 2 version</a>, which is also a Game Key-Card release.</p>
<p>It does look good though, and at least from the Japanese Partner Showcase, it looks smooth as butter on Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced a huge wave of material is coming for <em>Daggerheart</em>. During an official panel at GenCon 2025, the publisher announced new products, supplements, and collaborations with various tabletop influencers scheduled for release in the future.</p>



<p>The first wave of announcements at the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel was that official Class Packs would be coming. In response to Darrington being unable to keep physical copies of the Core Set in stock, which includes both the rulebook and a case of cards, they will be launching a Kickstarter campaign to produce individual character class packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-character-class-pack-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=WqgoxAdE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-character-class-pack-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=Nh_1zLJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name suggests, a single pack will contain 76 cards, providing everything a character needs to play a certain class from level 1 all the way to level 10. This includes ancestry cards, community cards, subclass cards, and all cards from the class's two domains.</p>

<p>In addition, Darrington has launched an official Homebrew Kit. This completely free resource provides readers with insights into how the systems and mechanics of <em>Daggerheart</em> were designed. In addition, it will provide resources for independent creators or third-party studios to make original creations. This includes player options like ancestries and communities, to entire campaign frames.</p>

<p>As the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel continued, Darrington confirmed that new supplements and prewritten adventures were on the way. An official Romantasy campaign frame, bringing players into a world of passion and power. For <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-world-tour-with-city-echoes-of-exandria-tour" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Critical Role</a> fans, the panel confirmed that their actual play, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-roles-daggerheart-age-of-umbra-mini-series-debuts-at-end-of-may" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Age of Umbra</em></a>, will be getting a Season 2.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-gencon-2025-panel-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford.jpg?itok=jPpFSPe8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-gencon-2025-panel-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford.jpg?itok=xFp4cK4r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Former <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> lead designers Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford are also working on two <em>Daggerheart</em> projects. Crawford will be working on a brand new setting for the game. Perkins will be writing a special adventure supplement, one that weaves multiple campaign frames into an interconnected epic.</p>

<p>But that's not all of the talent that Darrington has at their disposal. Keith Baker and Jenn Ellis, the creators of Eberron and <em>Phoenix Dawn Command</em> are creating a new original setting using the Daggerheart system.</p>

<p>Lastly, the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel confirmed partnerships with various TTRPG influencers and creators. This includes a wave of new&nbsp; <em>Daggerheart</em> actual plays, a mini-series form Legends of Avantris, and a one-shot by Dungeons and Daddies,</p>

<p>For those who enjoy minis and dice, Daggerheart's ancestries are now options in Hero Forge and official Daggerheart dice sets are being produced by Dispel Dice, Botch Dice, and Misty Mountain Gaming respectively.</p>

The difference between <em>Resurrection</em>, the video game <em>And Roger,</em> and other stories that centralize those kinds of perspectives, both come from a place of empathy. Mental illness has been a source of scares and tension for ages, and the reason it's trotted out over and over again is because it's cheap and effective. It's also insulting. It turns people who are suffering into props in a haunted house. It might feel good in the moment, but cheap and effective also means it doesn't <em>last</em>. But stories like <em>Resurrection</em> wrestle with the longstanding impacts of trauma and how really fucking <em>scary</em> that ends up being for the person who suffered the trauma and those in their lives. It's a different kind of scary, one that has you gripping the couch while at the same time wondering if you should be crying, it's a story I won't soon forget.</p><p>Rebecca Hall!</p><p>I love when some of our greatest actors are also genre freaks.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-indycar-racing">Rob Recommends: IndyCar Racing</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@srz?ref=remapradio.com"><span>sydney Rae</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Before I was into Formula 1, I loved Indycars. Named for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, this is America’s top open-wheel racing category and unlike Formula 1, it has always featured a mix of oval and road course racing. The series suffered a devastating civil war in the late 90s / early 2000s that basically destroyed its popularity for a decade as two competing series cannibalized one another and I moved my allegiances to F1 entirely.</p><p>The IndyCar racing series has been in an odd place for a few years. The level of racing has frequently been exceptional, and the rules of IndyCar lead to a more evenly-matched competitive playing field than F1. For two or three out of the last five years, I’d probably say that I enjoyed watching IndyCars more than Formula 1. But the series hasn’t enjoyed the prestige or popularity of F1 and a lot of its excellence has flown beneath the radar.</p><p>It’s especially worth watching now though for a couple reasons. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The line between a bad video game showcase and a great one can be exceedingly slim. Often it only takes one or two surprise reveals targeting the right genres and nostalgia centers for most players to come away with generally positive vibes. The July Nintendo Direct failed on that count. It didn’t help that a fresh flood of Switch 2 game key cards is sapping even some of the most diehard fans of any surplus enthusiasm.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The<em> Mario</em> maker’s revelation that Thursday’s presentation would be a “Partner Showcase” instead of an all-out Nintendo Direct was the first blow to ambient online hype levels. Okay, no new 3D<em> Mario</em> announcements or<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> release date. But hey, at least fans could count on some major third-party reveals, including another raft of big ports. Surely Microsoft, rumored to be bringing the big guns to Switch 2 any day now, would show up. </p><p>Alas, no. Instead, the July Direct offered only a few smaller new game announcements—<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>—and mostly spent its time rehashing stuff we already knew about like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Madden 26</em>, and <em>FC Sports 26</em>. Even a quick look at the next <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> felt thrown together and supremely underwhelming. And there was no big “oh shit!” moment like, say, <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> also coming to Switch 2. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">litany of Switch 2 fan wish-casting</a></span> prior to the showcase had gotten out of control, but not even one of the numerous highly anticipated third-party updates made it into the showcase. No more footage of<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, no release date for <em>Hades 2</em>, and no mention of the rumored <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> port. Switch 2 versions of other recent blockbusters were also MIA. No surprise port of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, or <em>Lies of P</em>. There weren’t even updates on when players will be able to get their hands on the Switch 2 versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p><p><em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, one of the more unusual games announced during the Direct, now serves as the unlikely encapsulation of this disappointment. It’s a multiplayer game where you sit around a campfire with friends. “Your goal: Campfire Level 10,” reads the description. “The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.” The gimmick is that it works with webcams to put players’ faces around the campfire. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were not impressed</a></span>. <br></p><p>A Switch 2 port of last year’s <em>Persona 3: Reloaded</em>, one of the better pieces of news from the event, highlights the other prong of player disappointment. Diehard Nintendo fans like their physical games, RPG players more than most, but the physical version of<em> Persona 3</em> is the latest to rely on a game key card instead of an actual cartridge with the game on it. It was far from the only game key card game announced during the Direct. </p><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is key card only too, as well as <em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</em>. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game key card on Switch 2, but fortunately it’s also coming to the original Switch where it will have a standard cartridge. Unfortunately, that version of the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will not have an upgrade path</a></span> to the Switch 2 version, so anyone who opts for the only physical version of the game on a Nintendo platform won’t be able to take advantage of any upgraded performance from the Switch 2 version. </p><p>There are still notable exceptions when it comes to the third-party publishers opting to cut corners with game key cards. At launch, the big one was<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which fit the entire base game and its massive expansion on a 64GB card. <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is another, as is <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion </em>which arrives in September. It can be done, and it’s unfortunate to see many of the publishers of games whose audiences care the most about that sort of the thing being precisely the ones to opt out. No one cares if<em> Madden 26</em> comes on the cartridge, but why is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on Switch 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just a download code in a box</a></span>?</p><p>Does any of this matter to the average Switch 2 owner? Probably not. The console is good and there will be no shortage of games to play this fall. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo’s slow-drip strategy</a></span> is, all things considered, probably the smart thing to do. God knows there are more than enough games to keep everyone busy until long after they become worm food. But the last few years of the Switch 1 weren’t exactly blowing fans’ lids off, and the Switch 2's first summer, with the notable exception of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has been a bit of a snoozefest. The first Nintendo Direct since the Switch 2 launched could have jolted fans back awake. Instead, the post-launch lull continues. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2004, Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima turned back the clock with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-18284">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, a previously untold Cold War story starring Big Boss, the clone father of franchise star Solid Snake.

Last year, Metal Gear Solid Delta producer Noriaki Okamura <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-producer-would-love-to-work-with-hideo-kojima-on-metal-gear-solid/1100-6524582/" data-ref-id="1100-6524582">shared his admiration for Kojima</a> as well as his desire to work with him on the MGS franchise in the future. But for now, Kojima's upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a> may be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">closest thing to getting another MGS-like game</a> from the creator.</p><p>Konami recently disclosed that Metal Gear Solid Delta will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-is-bringing-back-the-gloriously-goofy-secret-theater-from-snake-eater/1100-6532387/" data-ref-id="1100-6532387">bring back Snake Eater's goofy secret theater</a> and introduce <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/" data-ref-id="1100-6532384">a new online mode called Fox Hunt</a>. The publisher also released an early look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-opening-cinematic-features-new-version-of-iconic-song/1100-6531764/" data-ref-id="1100-6531764">Metal Gear Solid Delta's revamped opening sequence</a>, which includes a new version of the game's signature song. Okamura also expressed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-a-remake-of-the-first-metal-gear-solid-anytime-soon/1100-6526883/" data-ref-id="1100-6526883">doubts about remaking the first Metal Gear Solid game</a> in the future.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on August 28.</p>

                <p>Once again, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know-about-team-cherrys-metroidvania/1100-6520282/" data-ref-id="1100-6520282">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was noticeably absent from the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/" data-ref-id="2900-6828">Nintendo Direct on Thursday</a>. While nothing was confirmed ahead of the event, many fans were hopeful that this would finally be the moment for a long-awaited update. Any sort of new developments since its announcement in 2019 have been lean at best.</p><p>After the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed/1100-6513963/" data-ref-id="1100-6513963">last delay</a>, it seems at this point that Team Cherry is choosing to remain silent until the game is fully ready for release or, at the very least, until it has something substantial to share. While that level of secrecy is understandable, it does leave a vacuum that naturally fuels speculation and rumors--despite Microsoft insisting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-launching-this-year-according-to-microsoft/1100-6522715/" data-ref-id="1100-6522715">the game is coming out this year</a>. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: - Silksong Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>What we do know is that, unlike in the first Hollow Knight, Silksong follows Hornet as she begins deep underground in Pharloom and climbs toward the Citadel at its peak. Pharloom appears more industrialized than Hallownest, but Hornet's reason for being there--and whether Pharloom connects to Hallownest--remains unclear. What is clear is her desire to escape.</p><p>Silksong was originally penned for the first half of 2023. However, in May 2023, Team Cherry marketing and publishing representative Matthew Griffin announced that development was "still continuing" and that the game would be delayed. We finally got some footage last month that was part of a sizzle reel for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Xbox Ally</a>.</p><p>Speaking of, European players will get the opportunity to play it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-next-month-at-gamescom/1100-6533479/" data-ref-id="1100-6533479">during next month's Gamescom</a>. Xbox released its lineup for games it will be showing off this year, including the demo for Hollow Knight: Silksong. The question now is, "Was this worth the wait"?</p>

Pretty standard, right? It then, however, went on to state that it also wouldn't be supporting upgrades between versions and that players will just have to buy whichever version of the game they want separately.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The full post from Square Enix reads, "It is not possible to upgrade from the Switch version to the Switch 2 version once purchased. There are also no plans for an option to upgrade to the Switch 2 version in the future. Please make sure you purchase the correct version."</p><p>The news is disappointing, but hardly surprising from Square Enix, which has been making waves for this practice of late. Just earlier this year, it also got into hot water over a similar move with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-dragon-quest-remakes-wont-upgrade-from-switch-to-switch-2/1100-6533168/" data-ref-id="1100-6533168">physical versions</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-632913">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>. What makes both of these situations even weirder is that it is obviously not Square Enix's standard position on the matter: the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/" data-ref-id="5000-680914">upcoming remake of Final Fantasy Tactics</a> <em>does </em>support upgrades between the Switch and Switch 2 and it's even free. Numerous other developers have provided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">free</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">paid upgrades</a> for Switch 2 versions, which makes Square Enix's stance even more curious.</p><p>To the further disappointment of many, the Switch 2 version of Octopath Traveler 0 will be made available on a Game-Key card according to the <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/octopath-traveler-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's box art</a>. Instead of traditional Switch cartridges, which contain all the game's files already, these substitutes instead allow players to download the game, and the shift to these Game-Key cards has been a sore spot for preservationists and enthusiasts seeking out fully intact physical versions of the games they're buying.</p><p>Now, prospective players and fans are once again being made to pick between a technically inferior version of Octopath Traveler 0 on the Switch, where it will at least come on a cartridge, or a souped-up Switch 2 version that they can only really own digitally. It sounds like they aren't really happy with either option according to the replies on Square's Bluesky post.</p><p>Octopath Traveler 0 launches on the Switch and Switch 2, as well as PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, on December 4, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45577cb8ff836/pac-man-world-2-re-pac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not one to be disappointed often, especially with Directs. Yes, even Partner Showcases — some of the <em>best</em> Directs have been these third-party lead ones, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKB3WXRWTCM&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">June 2022's Mini Partner Showcase</a> ranking pretty highly for me.</p>
<p>Today's Partner Showcase was not one of those, which maybe hit a little harder because this was our first Direct post-Switch 2's launch.</p>
<p>It feels like we're in a new era for Nintendo, where release dates and brand new games can just randomly pop up on a news app, and the Switch 2 is now getting day-and-date ports like Bloober's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>; a cool little surprise for you horror fans out there. This Partner Showcase felt like it was ushering in that era.</p>
<p>But, for anyone watching who was maybe on the fence on buying Nintendo's shiny new console, this probably wasn't the Direct for you. I'm not sure if Partner Showcases have <em>ever</em> been targeted at people without the console, given that they focus on multiplatform releases, but when your console is brand new and you need a hook for people? This perhaps wasn't the greatest lineup.</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7195e7845c5d8/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I did make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-partner-direct-predictions-what-do-you-expect-to-see">one wild prediction</a> that was <em>never</em> going to happen (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a>, my beloved), I'm more than a little shocked that we still have a ton of games shown off during the April Direct that don't have release dates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, despite getting rated in June, is still MIA on Switch 2; a date would've lit the bonfires, or Sites of Grace, I guess. Instead, we get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, which looks cute and, importantly (for Nintendo, at least), uses GameChat and other Switch 2 exclusive features. But it's not a headliner, is it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, all of these games are sitting with a vague "2025" or "Winter" date, and they remain untouched (I think Silksong news is a Gamescom lock-in, though, given that it's playable there).</p>
<p>One of the games that did show up was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I thought for sure we'd get a date for that, but nope, still just "Winter". The trailer felt like a little poke, a reminder that the game exists. But hey, at least we saw a Champion's face <em>and</em> got a glimpse at a new construct.</p>

<p>I promise it wasn't all mediocre for me. My favourite game of the show should be pretty obvious to those who know me; it's a Square Enix HD-2D game, but not the one that <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-nos-predictions-pour-le-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-du-31-juillet-60313">was rumoured to be showing up</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the name, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> looks <em>lovely</em> and is exactly where I wanted Team Asano to go with HD-2D; not just a remake, something a little different, and an action RPG. It gives me a little bit of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a> vibe — multiple weapon types that you can upgrade, a small open world... Oh, and there's couch co-op! You know I've already downloaded the demo.</p>
<p>Sticking with Square Enix, I was worried <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> was going to be a port of <strong>Champions of the Continent</strong>, the mobile game. It's not, as Square Enix confirmed in <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/nintendo-direct-31-july-2025">a blog post</a>, and instead uses the mobile game as a base. And good lord, there's <em>town</em> building? Help me. And, as a little bonus, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Romancing SaGa 2</a>'s remake also gives me a good reason to finally play this one.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> is at last coming to a Nintendo console — it's a fantastic remake and, whether you've played FES or Portable or never touched the game at all, is well worth grabbing. I'm always happy to see a new Katamari game on Switch, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> looks delightful. And, while I've never played a game in this series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> looks pretty darn good, too.</p>
<p>If we were a year or two into the new console's life, I think this'd be a pretty solid Direct. Not earth-shattering, but a nice little cherry on top of the foundation already built. But we're not. We're not even two months in. So it's hard not to feel a little deflated.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because we're in a time when having multiple consoles is more common; my Switch 2 is, of course, my main platform right now, but I've already played Persona 3 Reload and I already own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> on PS4. Again, both great additions to the new system, and I know there's a bunch of people who want to play these games afresh or have yet to play them. Though the steady trickle of Game-Key Card confirmations for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2</a>, Octopath Traveler 0, and a few others seems to be dampening the mood.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's more-powerful specs, even when games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> looked a little rough, open the floodgates for a more mainstream suite of ports, like a feature-rich <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a>, and like Cronos. This is probably the new normal, so we're going to have to get used to it.</p>
<p>But even if you had modest expectations like me, I think many will feel a bit let down with today's showcase, particularly us early Switch 2 adopters. Fortunately, we've got plenty to look forward to — even if the very best stuff still doesn't have a release date. Honestly, Nintendo, how can you stick Hyrule Warriors in a Direct and not even give us a date...? Or a month?</p>
<p>I'm sure a full-fat Nintendo Direct, or even an Indie World later in the year, will be enough to satiate. But for now, I'm left wanting a little more from my new console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the end of June, amid a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">myriad of rumors</a> already circling about an incoming remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, the actor who played Edward Kenway, Matt Ryan, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/">practically confirmed</a> that the remake was real and that it was coming soon. Ubisoft took notice and, according to Ryan, wasn't too pleased with his apparent slip-up and threatened the actor with a lawsuit.</p>



<p>Ryan admitted to the legal threat while signing the box of a fan's Edward Kenway figure at a recent convention. First posted to TikTok by kylo_hd659, and then shared on <a href="https://x.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618">Twitter by TheHiddenOneAC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/">Insider-Gaming</a>), Ryan is asked by the fan about his comments and about the upcoming remaster, to which he first responds by shrugging and saying, "<em>Don't know</em>."</p>



<p>The fan presses him further, and Ryan explains, "<em>Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this *gestures to person filming,* and I was being very free and open. But I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone, and then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>It's unfortunate that, as Ryan explained, he wasn't aware he was being filmed at the time. Sure, you can argue that he shouldn't have said anything if he didn't want the trouble from Ubisoft, but there's also an argument to be made that Ubisoft is being a bit overly litigious here. </p>



<p>Ubisoft's own co-founder and chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">confirmed in June 2024</a> that there were remakes of Assassin's Creed games coming. Anyone who knows anything about the Assassin's Creed franchise knows that Ubisoft and its decision-making executives would be dumber than they already seem to be at times, if they weren't working on a remake of Black Flag. Ubisoft has also been in dire need of some good press around its projects and what it has coming down the pipeline. </p>



<p>It honestly seems like a waste of a day for Ubisoft's lawyers to write up the legal threat in the first place. Surely they had better things to do with their time, and a simple message from someone on Ubisoft's team who works directly with actors like Ryan, telling him to stop talking about the remake and referencing it, would have sufficed. </p>



<p>But then again, we can't exactly be too surprised about a video game company being overly litigious, nor can we be surprised about a mismanagement of time and resources at Ubisoft.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic has won again. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will not overturn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">the unanimous jury verdict from 2023</a> that Google’s app store and payments system have become illegal monopolies — and it appears to be pressing play on a previously paused permanent injunction <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">that would crack open Android</a> to undo the damage of those monopolies.</p><p>Today, a three-judge panel affirmed the lower court’s decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates">in Epic v. Google</a>, according to an full opinion you can read below — and Google will now appeal again, the company confirms to <em>The Verge</em>. It could be appealed to the Supreme Court next.</p><p>Judge M. Margaret McKeown begins her opinion for the panel:</p><div><blockquote><p>In the world of adrenaline-fueled survival that epitomizes the video game Fortnite, winners are decided in blazes of destruction and glory. By contrast, the outcome of this case—centered on Fortnite’s developer, Epic Games, and the Google Android platform—turns on longstanding principles of trial procedure, antitrust, and injunctive remedies.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>“Total victory in the Epic v Google appeal!” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1950962683387261359">tweets Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>.</p></div><p>Google will appeal: “This decision will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem. Our top priority remains protecting our users, developers and partners, and maintaining a secure platform as we continue our appeal,” writes Google global head of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland in a statement shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>But the Google Play Store may <em>not</em> be protected from the consequences of its monopoly while Google appeals — it may need to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">start cracking open Android for third-party stores</a> the way Judge James Donato ruled in his permanent injunction back in 2024. Last October, Donato <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24271996/google-epic-lawsuit-play-third-party-app-store-changes-delayed-administrative-stay-granted">pressed pause on all but one specific piece of his ruling</a> while Google appealed, but today, Judge McKeown writes “The stay motion on appeal is denied as moot in light of our decision.”</p><p>“The stay is lifted,” Epic spokesperson Cat McCormack confirms to <em>The Verge</em>. And as a result, Epic says it will put its own app store within Google’s app store. “Thanks to the verdict, the Epic Games Store for Android will be coming to the Google Play Store!” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1950968220833423451">Sweeney tweeted</a>.</p><p>The consequences of the full permanent injunction would stretch far beyond Epic’s game <em>Fortnite</em>: they would force Google to effectively open up its app store to competition for three whole years. Google would have to distribute other rival app stores within the Google Play store, too, give rivals access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, and it would be banned from a variety of anticompetitive practices including a requirement that apps use Google Play Billing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">You can read a summary of the details here</a>.</p><p>Epic originally sued both Google and Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal">in 2020</a> over the removal of its hit game <em>Fortnite </em>from both stores, though the case was more complicated than that. Epic intentionally used <em>Fortnite</em> as a wedge to challenge the app store monopolies, and in the case of Apple, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling">it mostly lost.</a></p><p>The appeals court did recognize Epic’s gambit today, writing that “Google removed Fortnite from the Play Store after Epic embedded secret code into the app’s software” that bypassed Google’s payment systems. (Epic has never denied it.)</p><p>But Epic v. Google turned out to be a very different case, we saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">when attending the trial in person and reading all the receipts</a>. A jury saw secret revenue sharing deals between Google, smartphone makers, and game developers. The jury saw internal emails between Google execs that suggested Google was scared of how Epic might convince its fellow game developers to join or create rival app stores, creating unwanted competition for Google. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24003500/epic-v-google-loss-apple-win-fortnite-trial-monopoly">Here are a few thoughts</a> about why Epic won against Google, but not Apple.</p><p>Today, the Ninth Circuit rejected the idea that the decision in the Apple case should impact the Google case, at least in terms of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23949223/google-is-opening-the-trial-with-market-definition">all-important</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2023/11/27/23978562/market-definition-epics-expert-suggests-its-the-difference-between-movie-theaters-and-televisions">question</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23978280/the-epic-v-google-economists-are-here-to-argue-market-definition">market definition</a>, aka “can Google really have a monopoly on Android apps if it’s competing against Apple?”</p><p>“The market definition question was neither identical to the issue in this case nor litigated and decided in Apple,” McKeown writes, adding that the “commercial realities are different”:</p><div><blockquote><p>Apple’s “walled garden” is, as the district court in Apple noted, markedly different from Google’s “open distribution” approach […] Google admits as much, noting that “Android’s open philosophy offers users and developers wider choices” than iOS does, even as that openness “limit[s] Google’s ability to directly protect users from encountering malware and security threats when they download apps.” As a consequence of its business model, Apple does not license iOS to other OEMs in the way that Google licenses Android to Samsung, Motorola, and other smartphone manufacturers.</p></blockquote></div><p>She also uses McDonalds and Chick-fil-A to make a point that markets can overlap:</p><div><blockquote><p>McDonald’s might compete against Chick-fil-A in the fast- food market yet not compete against Chick-fil-A in the <em>hamburger </em>fast-food market (and instead compete with Wendy’s, Burger King, Sonic, and In-N-Out Burger. Although Google and Apple compete for mobile-gaming downloads and mobile-gaming in-app transactions, they do not compete in the Android-only app distribution and in-app billing markets.</p></blockquote></div><p>Those two markets, Android app distribution and in-app billing, are where a jury unanimously decided that Google has a monopoly.</p><p><em>Developing… we’re adding more to this story now, refresh in a few minutes for more.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court]]></content:encoded>

This means Switch 2 owners wanting a physical copy of the game will be stuck between Switch 1 cart they can't upgrade and a Game-Key Card which — according to the official box art — will require a 5GB download.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kvjqum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Note about the Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch versions 1/2]<br>
The Switch 2 versions (both the physical and digital versions) can only be played on Nintendo Switch 2.<br>
[2/2]<br>
It is not possible to upgrade from the Switch version to the Switch 2 version once purchased. There are also no plans for an option to upgrade to the Switch 2 version in future. Please make sure you purchase the correct version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other publishers have offered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">Upgrade Packs</a> that let anyone with the Switch 1 game get the upgraded version of the game on the more powerful console but, for whatever reason, Square apparently has no interest in offering this as an option.</p>
<p>As a reminder for anybody out of the loop, Nintendo introduced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a> as an option for publishers on Switch 2. They don't contain any game data, with the cart acting — as the name suggests — as a key that must be inserted in the console, first to download the entire game from the eShop, and subsequently to access the game on your hard drive.</p>
<p>While this means that publishers can get a 'physical' product on store shelves and you have something to put on your own shelf (or resell, if you like), you'll still need to have the game downloaded and taking up storage space on your system - and you'll need the card inserted to play it.</p>
<p>Players' reaction to Game-Key Cards from players has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">largely negative</a>, although the option to get a physical copy of the Switch 1 game and then get the digital-only Upgrade Pack for Switch 2 was a compromise some were prepared to make. Zero chance of that here, it seems.</p>
<p>The game's not out until December, so it's possible plans could change. "Please make sure you purchase the correct version" doesn't sound promising, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Robo-Link, activate?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Nintendo Partner Direct, we got a new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. While most of the trailer was straightforward, it ended on a cryptic tease that has Zelda fans running with speculation as to what the scene could mean for the game's roster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the trailer shows a chamber deep inside a cavern where what appears to be one of the Constructs from Tears of the Kingdom is being assembled and activated. The Constructs themselves are nothing new - they're all over the place in Tears of the Kingdom, and we know they were created by Mineru during the events of Age of Imprisonment, so it makes sense we'd see them in the game. What's interesting about this one is that it appears to be roughly human-shaped and -sized, whereas none of the Constructs we've met before (including Mineru's own Construct) were quite that proportioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why are fans excited about this? Well, a lot of folks think this means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeLink/comments/1me38a5/how_are_we_feeling_about_construct_link_x_zelda/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we're getting some sort of Robo-Link playable in Age of Imprisonment</a>. The game takes place in the far, far distant past, thousands of years before the main events of Tears of the Kingdom, and in the time period that Zelda is transported to at the start of that game. It covers the events of the Imprisoning War as Zelda experienced it during her time in that era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, chronologically, it doesn't make any sense that Link would be playable in Age of Imprisonment. There was no Link in that era, after all. That said, it also seems baffling that a Legend of Zelda game, even a spin-off, could exist without Link involved. This is why a lot of fans have been speculating that Link will find some way to turn up, whether that's through alternate timeline shenanigans (see: Age of Calamity) or some other method. And this teaser offers one possibility for this hoped-for Linkening: maybe Link somehow gets to embody one of Mineru's constructs made in his likeness, so he can fight alongside the others of that era.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">nintendo you know i dont play about fi please dont play with me <a href="https://t.co/Uj0QOJQ9aj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Uj0QOJQ9aj</a></p>— ava (@zeldevil) <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldevil/status/1950913028670787672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there's one other detail that has fans thinking this is going in a different direction. If you listen back to the ending teaser, there's a bit of music that plays as the scene transitions to the Construct. If you're a Skyward Sword fan, you'll recognize it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV1Efuh-aus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fi's Theme</a>. The presence of this little chime has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me1h85/aoi_new_age_of_imprisonment_trailer_in_nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some suspecting that this won't be a Robo Link</a>, but actually a way for Fi to finally reappear in a Zelda game after being (understandably) absent for so long. Some are suggesting this could be possible given that Zelda obtains the broken Master Sword at the start of her time in the ancient era. Given that Fi dwells within the sword, what if they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me2vii/totk_rise_up_because_we_are_so_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used its fragments to give her a body to fight with</a>? Anything's possible!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that means it's also possible this thing is none of the above and we're in for some sort of weird twist surprise when the game comes out. Age of Calamity, after all, wasn't quiiiite what we thought it was by the endgame, so it's likely Age of Imprisonment also has some tricks up its sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We unfortunately still don't have a firm release date for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment but know it's coming to Nintendo Switch 2 sometime this winter. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at today's Nintendo Partner Direct right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> fans tuning in were left disappointed by yet another video game showcase passing with no further word of Team Cherry's highly-anticipated, long-awaited sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And to be fair to the fans, there was cause to think today might finally bring Silksong's much-desired release date. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Nintendo Direct earlier this year confirmed the game would arrive in 2025</a>, raising hopes of a fresh appearance today. And, just days ago, Microsoft announced that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">Silksong will be playable via a fresh Xbox demo</a> in a couple of weeks at Gamescom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid this backdrop, hopes were high — but, as we now know, they were in vain. Reaction to the Nintendo Direct on the Hollow Knight and Silksong subreddits has, perhaps to be expected, not been positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top thread currently on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1me1j9k/aaahahahahahahah/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> is a meme of a cat laughing open-mouthed, pointing at the screen. "It's never been so over", "The cycle of pain", "Silksong isn't real" read a selection of the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've genuinely lost so much hype for this game," wrote reddit user YeetHead10. "I was so excited last year but now I've just moved on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"No you havent," replied DirtySlutMuffin. "You're here complaining."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At least this is consistent in my life," CringeNaeNaeBaby2 said, referring to the constant disappointment around Silksong they faced. "You know when they go to jail, spend years trying to get out, then beg to be readmitted after being freed? I'm gonna beg for Silksong to be unreleased. I need the longing, the spite keeps me alive. I'm gonna drop dead when Silksong comes out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans simply seem upset at their own frustration, though a few have suggested Silksong developer Team Cherry should be doing more to set expecations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like people would be taking it better if Team Cherry themselves gave more frequent updates," wrote reddit user ChocoGoodness, "instead of letting us wait for Nintendo or Xbox or whatever to announce it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, all we know of Silksong's arrival is that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">will launch before Christmas 2025, and not be tied to the release of the ROG Ally X handheld</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything that <em>was </em>shown today, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.

<p dir="ltr">Nintendo of America staff then shared some of their own, alternate Pokemon character designs. The designs were apparently so traumatic that Ishihara said he "won't show those illustrations to anyone as long as I live."</p><p dir="ltr">"They kind of looked like the characters from the Cats musical," Ishihara said. "So, for example, Pikachu was changed into a character shaped like a kind of tabby cat with huge breasts."</p><p dir="ltr">Later in the interview, Ishihara is asked to clarify what the design looked like, and if it looked similar to when women dress up like Pikachu at anime conventions.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, exactly," Ishihara said, seemingly clearing up any potential confusion. "They presented that kind of design to us for real. I thought it was interesting, in a sense of appreciating such cultural differences. However, I didn't want to compete in the [overseas] market with that kind of thing."</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon, of course, would go on to be released overseas with relatively few changes from the original Japanese version, creating a multi-media juggernaut that still continues today. It feels fairly safe to assume that might not have been the case had Pokemon all been anthropomorphized animals with big boobs.

<p>And it's got a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a survival horror fan, you've probably been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a brand new sci-fi third-person shooter where you jump between 1980's Poland and a dystopian future. Previews for the game dropped earlier this week for other platforms, and they seem solid across the board.</p>
<p>Luckily, Switch 2 owners don't need to miss out on the scares, as the game was confirmed to be coming to the new Nintendo console on the same day as other platforms; <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Developed by Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Cronos puts you in the suit of The Traveller who live in a world post "Change", a cataclysm that turned many humans into 'Orphans', monsters who now prowl across the world.</p>
<p>Traveller's job is to jump back in time to the '80s and extract the souls of those who were transformed during the apocalyptic event. Gunplay and combat is thoughtful and you can't just shoot your way through every encounter — even if you want to when a terrifying monster is approaching you.</p>

<p>This was probably the biggest surprise of the Direct for us — a game that's already pretty established getting a Switch 2 version <em>and</em> release date, the same day as other consoles? That's a shock we're willing to accept.</p>
<p>And hey, if previews are anything to go by, this looks pretty solid; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">IGN</a>, <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145273/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview">Shacknews</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/after-2-hours-with-the-silent-hill-2-devs-slimy-sci-fi-beast-cronos-im-thrilled-it-has-dead-space-dna-and-the-soul-of-resident-evil-this-is-more-like-a-love-letter-to-survival-horror-than-to-poland/">Gamesradar</a> all have good things to say.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team's 2021 psychological horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> is being adapted into a film by Gary Dauberman, the man who horror fans will recognize as the writer and producer of the recent <em>It</em> and <em>Annabelle</em> films.</p>



<p>Dauberman won't be writing on the project himself, as he is currently in the process of looking for a writer and director to helm the film. Dauberman's production company, Coin Operated, which he runs along with the company's president, Mia Maniscalco, will be producing the film.</p>



<p>Dauberman told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, who first reported the news of the adaptation, that "<em>With its compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals, </em><em>The Medium</em> is a natural for a feature film adaptation. When I talked to Piotr [Babieno] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed. I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and I’m excited to be working alongside them."</p>



<p>For Bloober Team's part, chief executive officer Piotr Babieno added, "<em>Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with </em><em>The Medium</em>, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us. From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what becomes of this film. Dauberman most recently worked on the adaptation of Until Dawn, which, by most accounts <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/">did not impress audiences</a>. Whoever he gets to work on this adaptation as a writer and director will, of course, likely be the make-or-break element of this film.</p>



<p>The other interesting aspect about this adaptation news is that it brings into question what's happening with the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-the-medium-tv-series-the-witcher-producer/">TV series adaptation</a> of The Medium. The assumption, now that this film adaptation has been announced, is that nothing is happening with that series, and that it's another of dozens of projects that are born and die before they ever get close to audiences in the regular Hollywood churn. </p>



<p>Or perhaps we'll see the TV series be born again after this film with a different angle. Or maybe we'll see neither, as this film adaptation could see the same end the TV series did.</p>

Being afflicted with Thunderblight and subsequently getting stunned is highly likely if your resistance isn’t high enough. </p><p>Besides a couple of projectile attacks, Lagiacrus’ physical attacks are similar to Mizutsune’s, in that they’ll cover a substantial amount of ground lunging and sweeping their entire body at you. Don’t expect a certain area to feel safer, the way you can lie low underneath <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">Zoh Shia</a></span>. Well-timed guards and evades are incredibly important for a fight like this.</p><p><strong>Prioritizing hits to the back is a smart way to restrict some of Lagiacrus’ Thunder attacks and collect the not-so-common Lagiacrus Shockspike material.</strong> Heavy Bowguns and other weapons with long reach will be fine, but Dual Blade users like me mostly have to rely on traps and mounting. A great method for any hunter to dish out damage to the back is by dodging through the monster’s massive discharge attack, since that can reveal a Focus Strike spot for a few seconds after.</p><p>The environment is a helpful friend in a fight like this. Never hesitate to lead it towards Poisoncups, Sporepuffs, or into a turf war with another monster. On the likely chance it moves to Area 15, trigger the Dam Rubble interactable with your slinger. You’ll deal a lot of damage and knock it down for a bit.</p><p>Lagiacrus will retreat to the newly added Area 19 at the tail end of the fight. It will briefly surface along the edge of Area 13, where you can trigger Unstable Rubble to fall and knock it out of the water. No matter if you interrupt its journey or not, you’ll track it to Area 19. Keep the hits coming to make the monster dive into the nearby water. This is when you can follow after it and fight the “Lord of the Seas” on its own turf.</p><figure id="" data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bear in mind that underwater combat isn’t as fleshed out as regular combat. While there is free movement and access to the Evade button, you’ll mainly be fighting with your slinger. You can use it to drop Submerged Rubble, collect Piercing Pods, or directly latch onto Lagiacrus in a similar interaction to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">Mounting</a></span>. The latter is the best way to deal big damage during this part of the hunt.</p><p>Hurt Lagiacrus enough during this phase to trigger a cool cinematic of your hunter smacking the hell out of it and taking the fight back on land. If there isn’t enough damage dealt, the watery serpent will quickly create a whirlpool that unleashes a massive discharge of electricity. Swim as far away as possible to avoid losing a majority of your health or even fainting. Either way, the fight will transition back up top for the final bout. Play it smart and you’ll be done soon enough.</p><p>Tempered Lagiacrus kicks the difficulty up many notches. Attacks are frequently chained together and they all hurt a lot. Evading seems to be a more manageable strategy than guarding against these attacks. I’ve seen great results using the Rey Dau <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351">Gamma armor</a></span> that’s forged from fighting Arch-Tempered Rey Dau. On top of the included high Thunder Resistance, it offers many other useful skills for both offense and defense. Throw in some Evade Window and Partbreaker decorations to give yourself a real fighting chance.</p><h2 id="h822233"><a id=""></a>Lagiacrus’s drops</h2><figure id="" data-id="81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-recommend-id="image://81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-recommend-id="image://81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The only thing better than defeating the “Lord of the Seas” is all the parts you get after.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Oink Games [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/oink-games">Oink Games</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Chillin' by the Fire" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin’ by the Fire</a></em>, a campfire <a title="Genres > Simulation [797 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> for <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [267 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. It is available now via <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chillin-by-the-fire-switch-2/" target="_blank">Nintendo eShop</a> for $14.99. <span id="more-981194"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Oink Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Only the faint crackling of firewood fills the night. A quiet, low-poly world, where each player’s voice blends with the flickering of the campfire—that’s <em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, the campfire simulation game.</p><p>In <em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, your goal is to grow your campfire while doing things such as splitting firewood, stacking firewood, and fanning the flames. In order to grow your fire, you can’t have too much or too little firewood. The thickness of the wood, how you stack the wood in the fire, and the timing are also very important, and sometimes you just need to sit back and wait for a while. This quiet back-and-forth with nature will draw you in…and when the fire finally roars to life, the sense of accomplishment you’ll feel is more satisfying than any high score could ever be.</p><p>You can enjoy the game solo at your own pace, or gather around the fire online with friends and family using GameChat or GameShare. Camera feeds appear around the fire, making it feel like you’re truly together in the same place. You can work together to build a fire, or compete with your own firepits. There’s a variety of different playstyles waiting for you. In addition, there’s a built-in “Campfire Convo” feature which helps keep the chat exciting.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.</li><li><strong>Communication Around the Campfire</strong> – You can play online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> with the members of your GameChat session.

But that’s not all, with an external camera connected, you can video chat with CameraPlay. You and your friends’ real faces will show up around the campfire. As the light of the flames reflect off your expressions, you’ll feel the same warmth even with players who are far away—such a mysterious sense of closeness. Campfire Convo prompts will be displayed randomly, helping to spark some small talk. From every day chit-chat to late-night philosophy, the conversations are sure to get exciting.</li><li><strong>Beauty in Simplicity—Blazing <a title="Companies > Orange [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/orange">Orange</a> Gradients in HDR</strong> – The visuals are intentionally low-poly.

No Problem.</strong> – The game comes equipped with features to help you, such as the “Voice of the Fire,” which tells you about the condition of the fire and gives general advice, a detailed “Campfire Guide,” and a visual display that shows the status of the firewood. Even if you have no experience building a campfire, you can still have fun playing with confidence. Players that are new to campfires are encouraged to explore the game’s hidden depth. For experience campers, these features can be turned off, for a more demanding and refined challenge. In a world that’s always rushing, reclaim the simple joy of just watching a fire.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Nintendo Direct: July 31, 2025 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Chillin' by the Fire – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="チルっと焚き火ソン [Nintendo Direct ソフトメーカーラインナップ&nbsp;2025.7.31]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8SasBNe79I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/campfire-simulation-game-chillin-by-the-fire-announced-for-switch-2-now-available]]></content:encoded>
