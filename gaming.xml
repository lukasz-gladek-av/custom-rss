			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-god-slayer-is-an-open-world-steampunk-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-my-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The God Slayer</a> is the next big project in development at Chinese developer Pathea Games, known for My Time at Portia, My Time at Sandrock, and the upcoming third installment in that series, My Time at Evershine. </p>



<p>With The God Slayer, the studio is challenging itself with a more mature open world steampunk action RPG, not to mention switching engines from Unity to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. I recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-god-slayer-qa-from-our-point-of-view-weve-always-been-making-open-world-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> Zifei Wu, founder and creative director at Pathea Games, to learn more about the game. During that conversation, I also inquired about the studio's stance on using generative AI tools during game development. You can find his answer below.</p>



<p><em>I think the only AI we use is when we're iterating. Like, for example, we say okay, we want this character to be a female salesperson, and then we'll try to use AI to go online to search for different models and stuff like that, and then after that, we just do it ourselves. I think overall, our developers don't want to use AI too much. First of all, you don't see a lot of Asian steampunk examples out there, so the examples that AI gives us are weird if I can put it that way. So, a lot of the stuff we actually have to think about ourselves and start from scratch. Overall, that's helped us keep the world setting as well as the characters of The God Slayer grounded. So I think, as far as like for us, I think we're not using too much AI. It's at least for now, the correct way to go.</em></p>



<p>The usage of generative AI tools is currently one of the most controversial topics within most industries, and that certainly includes the gaming industry. We recently reported that Masahiro Sakurai, the creator of Super Smash Bros., <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes</a> that generative AI could make large-scale development more manageable. Hideo Kojima, the creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding franchises, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims</a> to utilize the technology to automate basic tasks, allowing him to focus on the creative aspects of game development.</p>



<p>In an interview with Wccftech, Richard Pillosu, co-founder of Spanish indie developer Epictellers Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> a similar, albeit more unequivocal, opinion, stating that there is no point in using AI in any creative endeavour. In another Wccftech exclusive, Dean Hall, known for DayZ and ICARUS, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dayz-creator-says-ai-fears-remind-him-people-worrying-about-google-wikipedia-ai-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that AI is here and what really matters is how to deal with its impact. Lastly, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-ai-trained-human-scripts-more-natural-conversations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> that game characters could feel more realistic if AI-trained on scripts created by humans.</p>



<p>The God Slayer will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and potentially for next-gen platforms if available at the game's launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. I’ve got some great news for you. Today, yes today, is Friday. Tell everyone you know. Spread the word. Friday is back, baby. And on this wonderful Friday, I welcome you to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we wonder what happened to a good <i>Black Ops 7 </i>map, learn more about why <em>Hytale</em> is skipping Steam, and ponder high console prices.</p> <h2>Used Xbox consoles are going for some wild prices</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1pefqsl/dang_these_prices_are_getting_absurd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Over on Reddit,</a> people are shaking their heads in disbelief at the state of used game console prices. In 2025, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/certifiedrefurbishedxbox">Microsoft is selling refurbished Xbox Series X consoles for $550</a>. In 2020, I bought an Xbox Series X at launch for $500. Microsoft is also selling used Xbox Series S consoles for $330. At launch, the smaller machine was just $300, and you could often get it for less if you found a deal. These are absurd prices, but also not surprising when you consider how expensive consoles are in 2025, thanks to various factors like tariffs, inflation, AI squeezing demand, and every company trying to grow profits.</p>

 <p>Regardless of why prices are so high, it sucks that this is the first console generation where PlayStation and Xbox machines are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1kdmdw4/a_history_of_xbox_console_prices_at_launch_vs_4/">more expensive five years after launch</a>. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525#:~:text=SSD%20and%20RAM%20maker%20Micron%20announced%20it%E2%80%99s%20getting%20out%20of%20the%20consumer%20business%20to%20focus%20on%20manufacturing%20for%20companies%E2%80%99%20AI%20computing%20needs.%20%E2%80%9CThe">prices are likely to keep going up for new and used consoles</a>. I can’t wait to take out a small bank loan to buy a PlayStation 6.</p>

 <h2><strong>A popular <em>CoD: Black Ops 7</em> map has been mysteriously removed</strong></h2> <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7′</em>s first season is now live, and while it has added a lot of new content to the online FPS, it has also removed something: the fan-favorite map Blackheart. This was one of the original maps to launch with<em> Black Ops 7</em> and quickly became one of its most popular. But it’s gone now. Activision says it was removed “temporarily” from both private and public map pools as it investigates an undisclosed “issue.” The map will return in a future, but-not-yet-specified update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> </p> <p>Blackheart has been temporarily removed from both Public and Private map pools while we investigate an issue. It will return in an upcoming update.</p> <p>Details: <a href="https://t.co/rmpoklhguD">https://t.co/rmpoklhguD</a></p> <p>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1996651809017045428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <h2><strong>Newly discovered fish species gets <em>Dragon Ball-</em>inspired name</strong></h2> <p>As spotted by <em>Dexerto</em>, a new small fish was discovered deep in the ocean near an island off the coast of Japan. And, likely due to its bright yellow markings across its body, the fish has been given the scientific name of Vanderhorstia Supersaiyan. Yup, this is a <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> fish. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10228-025-01047-6">You can read more about the fish here</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong>Newly resurrected <em>Hytale</em> won’t be on Steam at launch</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this year, <em>Minecraft</em>-inspired survival game <em>Hytale</em> was canceled by Riot Games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">Then, in November</a>, the original creator behind the project was able to negotiate the rights back for the game, and now Hytale is back in development with some of the team that was working on it before it was canned. But when it launches in early access, you won’t find it on Steam.</p> <p><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">As explained in a new FAQ</a> on the game’s website, the devs are going to avoid Steam for a bit to focus on its existing community and improving the game instead of chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.”&nbsp; The post clarifies that the team isn’t looking to avoid “bad reviews,” but I have to imagine that’s part of the reason the team is staying away from Steam until the game is in a good state. A game on Steam with negative or mixed reviews can be hard to overcome. I’ll be curious to see if more teams follow this move.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-carter-wu-homer-simpson-nipples-skins-shirtless-2000650650">Nipples are now allowed in <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641">Oh no, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> gave me what I wanted, and I hate it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/it-took-19-years-but-were-finally-getting-total-war-medieval-3-2000650612">Wow, 20 years later, <em>Medieval Total War 3</em> is happening&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-banjo-kazooie-sequel-remake-game-built-in-dreams-impressive-2000650541">Wow, this fan-made <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> game is rad</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>Cyber Monday and Black Friday are a thing of the past at this point, but if you didn’t get a chance to grab all that you wanted during the biggest sale of the year, all is not lost. We’re still spotting quite a few lingering deals across retailers, so whether you’re after a new laptop, the latest smartphone, a kitchen appliance, or a subscription, there’s still time to save.</p>
<p>Stacksocial, in particular, is being the most generous with its post-Cyber Week drops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">We just spotted it offering a lifetime license of the 2021 Microsoft Office Professional for Windows at a whopping 84% discount.</a> This brings the price down to just $35, from $220. It’s selling out fast, though. We recommend grabbing your sooner rather than later, as the offer could wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>Note that this licensing type will be connected with your actual device, and not your Microsoft account. You will receive the redemption code with all the instructions immediately via email after your purchase, and you’ll have a week to set everything up. There are some system requirements you should know about before proceeding, as well. First, you should have Windows 10 or 11 installed, as the license is not supported on older versions. You’ll also need at least 1GB RAM, 4GB space available for hard disk formatting such as HFS+ (aka Windows OS Extended or HFS Plus), and a monitor with 1280×800 resolution or higher. Most latest systems already have all of this, but we still recommend double-checking before you proceed.</p>
<p>Office Professional 2021 includes Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams (Free version only), OneNote, Publisher, and Access; everything you need for work, creative, and personal use. Word makes it easy to create and edit documents with a whole bunch of useful tools built right in, while Excel offers an easy way to handle data on a regular basis. You’ll be able to create stunning, jaw-dropping presentations with PowerPoint, take quick meetings using Teams, and manage calendars or emails using Outlook like a pro. OneNote is a personal favorite because of how fun it makes creating notes and organizing them in a single place. You can create different notebooks for different projects, incorporate media content within those, and a lot more.</p>



<p>Students can use these helpful programs to create assignments and collaborate on projects. Work professionals will be able to track their deadlines, create presentations, and manage emails; the possibilities are endless. On a regular day, you’d pay around $220 to enjoy all these features, but thanks to this Cyber Week deal, you can do it for just $35 today. It takes $185 off the price of an all-in-one solution. Don’t confuse it with Microsoft 365, though, which is a subscription service that offers the latest Office apps and lets you use them on multiple devices. This one is more of a one-and-done purchase with the core applications. You also won’t be able to use the programs on multiple devices with this license.</p>
<p>Make sure you redeem the activation code within 7 days of your purchase, as it won’t be valid after that. This is also a great time to grab some other subscriptions for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">For instance, Stacksocial is also offering Windows 11 Home and Pro at a massive discount, as well. But get your orders in quickly, because the deals are selling out fast</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/</link>
            <guid>1374505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been officially announced that Netflix is set to buy Warner Bros. in 2026 as part of a whopping $82.7 billion deal. Not only will Netflix acquire the rights to numerous Warner Bros. IPs, such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and DC Comics, but it’ll also acquire all of Warner Bros. Games studios.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. has been no slacker in the gaming industry, either. Some major studios will be shifting to Netflix’s ownership, though whether the acquisition will affect their development remains to be seen.</p>







<p>This acquisition is certain to send shockwaves across every corner of the entertainment world, and the gaming sector is no exception. Warner Bros. Games oversees eight major studios, all of which are now set to feel the effects of Netflix’s takeover in one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-studio-owned-by-warner-bros-games">Every Studio Owned By Warner Bros. Games</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>In total, Warner Bros. Games oversees eight major studios—all of which will now come under Netflix’s ownership.</strong></p>



<p>These teams span a wide range of scale and specialties. From blockbuster franchises like Mortal Kombat to the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series, each studio has played a role in shaping some of gaming’s biggest hits. With such a diverse line-up moving to a new parent company, the industry will be watching closely to see how Netflix steers their future.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of every studio currently operating under the Warner Bros. Games banner:</p>



<h3 id="h-avalanche-software">Avalanche Software</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The magical world of Harry Potter. Credit to Avalanche Software.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Avalanche Software have been around since 1995, and they’ve produced a variety of games over the years. Their most recent release was the incredibly popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, though they’d had some success developing some Disney titles throughout the 2010s, such as Disney Infinity and Toy Story 3. </p>



<p>In regard to their upcoming projects, all eyes are on a sequel. There’s long been speculation that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-a-priority-for-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy 2 is in development</a>, with the studio admitting that it’s a priority going forward.</p>







<h3 id="h-netherrealm-studios">NetherRealm Studios</h3>



<p>There’s one major franchise that people think of when NetherRealm Studios is mentioned: Mortal Kombat. The team is widely regarded as royalty in the fighting-game genre, and their other flagship series, Injustice, delivers the same high-impact combat through a DC Comics lens.</p>



<p>While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/">Morta</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l K</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/">ombat 3 movie</a> is officially in development, the future of the games themselves remains uncertain due to Warner Bros. Games’ acquisition. Speculation has been swirling for years about NetherRealm’s next project, with fans divided between two possibilities—a follow-up to Mortal Kombat 1 or a long-awaited Injustice 3. Whatever their future holds, fans will be hoping the Netflix merger doesn’t impact development.</p>



<h3 id="h-rocksteady-studios">Rocksteady Studios</h3>



<p>The Batman: Arkham series reshaped the landscape of modern superhero games, and Rocksteady Studios is the team that made it happen. Prior to Arkham Asylum, the studio’s only release was Urban Chaos: Riot Response on the PS2 and Xbox—but their work with Batman propelled them into industry stardom.</p>



<p>Their most recent project, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, landed with a mixed reception, yet Rocksteady remains a major force with the potential for a significant comeback. As for what comes next, nothing has been confirmed. Rumours continue to circulate about a return to Gotham with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Batman title supposedly in development</a>, but until an official announcement arrives, the studio’s next move remains firmly under wraps.</p>



<h3 id="h-tt-games">TT Games</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Fire up the Bat Signal. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>TT Games, or Traveller’s Tales, encompasses four major subsidiaries, though they all work together under the same umbrella. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Traveller’s Tales</strong>. Primary Division of TT Games.</li>



<li><strong>TT Fusion</strong>. Division focused on porting games to handheld platforms.</li>



<li><strong>TT Games Publishing</strong>. Division focused on handling publishing duties.</li>



<li><strong>TT Odyssey</strong>. Mobile games developer.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re somehow not aware, these guys are responsible for the hugely successful and childhood-defining LEGO games. Its upcoming title, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, is slated for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 release</a> and will probably be the first Warner Bros. game published following the Netflix acquisition announcement.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-montreal">WB Games Montreal</h3>



<p>It’s no secret that Warner Bros. Games Montréal has had a mixed run in recent years. The studio supported Rocksteady on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and before that developed Gotham Knights, another Arkham-adjacent project that met with a fairly lukewarm reception.</p>



<p>Despite this, it appears the team isn’t finished with the DC universe just yet. Reports suggest they’re now working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wb-games-montreal-is-working-on-a-aaa-live-service-title-based-on-dc-comics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new AAA live-service title set within the DC Comics world</a>. Exactly what form that will take is still unclear, but fans will be hoping it avoids the pitfalls of previous superhero live-service attempts—particularly the comparisons to Marvel’s Avengers.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-boston">WB Games Boston</h3>



<p>Warner Bros. Games Boston is best known for its work on MMO-RPGs, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-new-york">WB Games New York</h3>



<p>WB Games New York works with developers to build online features and communities for video games. It’s not directly involved with developing a standalone video game. </p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-san-francisco">WB Games San Francisco</h3>



<p>A Division of Warner Bros. Games that specifically works on mobile releases and titles, utilising IPs such as Harry Potter and the DC Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-warner-bros-games-amp-netflix-merger">What Is The Warner Bros. Games &amp; Netflix Merger?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix has officially acquired Warner Bros.</a> and all of its subsidiaries in a blockbuster deal reportedly valued at $82.7 billion—one of the largest entertainment acquisitions in history. The move marks a seismic shift in the media landscape, placing an enormous collection of globally renowned properties under the Netflix banner and signalling the company’s most aggressive expansion into traditional film, TV, and gaming yet.</p>



<p>The deal grants Netflix ownership of an expansive catalogue of IPs, ranging from Harry Potter to the full DC Comics universe. This also encompasses Warner Bros.’ prestigious film and television library, animation houses, HBO programming, and various production entities across the globe.</p>



<p>Crucially, the purchase includes Warner Bros. Games, bringing all eight of its studios—and their respective franchises—into Netflix’s growing gaming portfolio. That means Netflix now owns teams behind major titles such as Mortal Kombat, Batman: Arkham, LEGO games, Middle-earth, and more.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Animal Crossing: Wild World is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, December 5, 2025. Below, we look at how its modest pathing system laid the groundwork, so to speak, for what the series has become.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing has always balanced two fantasies: the joy of customizing a cozy little town and the simple pleasures of living among a cast of charming, slightly strange animal neighbors. Those two elements worked in tandem. Your creative expression shaped your village, but the daily routines of chatting with neighbors, fishing by the riverbank, and uncovering little surprises gave the world its soul.</p><p dir="ltr">Somewhere along the way, however, customization did not just complement village life--it began to overshadow it. And if you trace that shift back through the franchises' history, the turning point can be found within 2005's Animal Crossing: Wild World.</p><p dir="ltr">When Wild World released on the Nintendo DS, players expected a portable follow-up to the GameCube classic. What they did not expect was that the community would stumble onto a feature that would change how players approached the series forever. It was not a new tool, a new building, or a new villager type. It was something almost laughably simple. It was a path.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZB73-XpxR0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ZB73-XpxR0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Custom designs already existed, but Wild World allowed players to place those designs freely outdoors. The intended purpose was small decorations and personal flair. What players actually did with the feature was far more ambitious. Once someone placed a tile in front of their house, they realized they could place another, then another, then a line of them stretching down the hillside toward the river. Suddenly, a mere decorative option transformed into a way to redesign the entire town.</p><p dir="ltr">Players began laying designs across their villages to create dirt trails, stone walkways, mossy forest routes, and pixel-art mosaics that zigzagged across the map. Wild World towns became sprawling canvases filled with hand-made road systems, seasonal pathways, and intricate layout experiments. A village was no longer just a place you inhabited. It was something you curated down to the color of a leaf laying on the ground under your feet.</p><p dir="ltr">This discovery fundamentally shifted how players thought about Animal Crossing. For the first time, one town could look drastically different from another. In the GameCube original, towns varied based on layout and villager mix, but they all followed the same structure. Wild World gave players the means to break from that structure entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo only formally embraced paths years later, but Wild World’s influence appeared in every entry that followed. City Folk still let players carve out basic routes using designs, even if the system was more limited. New Leaf opened the floodgates. The introduction of custom design QR codes sparked a golden age of path sharing on Tumblr, GameFAQs, and early Twitter. Players traded wooden planks for rustic forests, geometric tiles for urban hubs, stone borders for garden pathways, and soft floral stepping stones for cottages long before cottage-core became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p dir="ltr">Then came the real shift in how Animal Crossing functioned.</p><p dir="ltr">When Animal Crossing: New Horizons launched in 2020, Nintendo finally acknowledged that paths had become central to the series. The Island Designer app made path placement a built-in system rather than an improvised one. Terraforming lets players reshape cliffs, rivers, and coastlines to match the layouts they envisioned. For many players, building an island felt less like moving into a place and more like designing it from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">New Horizons was a global phenomenon, but it also solidified the series' new identity. Players became architects first, residents second. The core loop encouraged planning and layout experimentation. Some created zen gardens and tranquil forest towns. Others built dense shopping districts, amusement piers, horror-themed mazes, or entire cities with street grids and elevated walkways. The island's shape and flow became the primary creative outlet.</p><p dir="ltr">This evolution traces directly back to Wild World. Once players discovered they could cover entire towns with handmade designs, the series gradually shifted from a life sim about daily rituals to a platform for personal expression. The small social rhythms of talking to villagers and discovering tiny events still mattered, but they increasingly played a supporting role. The atmosphere began to matter more than routine. Layout mattered more than tradition.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaxHm2zu0AE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MaxHm2zu0AE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The shift did not diminish the original charm of Animal Crossing. Instead, it showed how flexible the series could be. What began as a relaxed slice-of-life sim with quirky animals became, little by little, a playground for digital landscaping, environmental storytelling, and light urban planning. Animal Crossing grew up alongside its players, reflecting changing tastes and expanding creative ambition.</p><p dir="ltr">Nearly twenty years after Wild World, paths still sit at the heart of how players shape their towns. Entire YouTube channels and TikTok creators dedicate themselves to showcasing island layouts. Fan-made path sets circulate like seasonal fashion lines, complete with new color palettes and patterns each month.</p><p dir="ltr">Paths determine whether a town feels like a rustic forest hideout, a bright beachside boardwalk, a modern city block, a mystical grove, or a retro village pulled from a Super Nintendo RPG. They guide how you move through your town and how you experience it day to day. They influence everything from your morning routine to your choice of furniture themes.</p><p dir="ltr">As Wild World celebrates another anniversary this December, it is fitting to recognize the small, player-driven innovation that changed everything. Wild World may not be the flashiest entry in the series, but it laid down something more important than a set of tiles. It laid down the path for what the franchise would become.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced more details on the next big update for GTA 5's multiplayer mode, including the long-awaited return of Michael De Santa.</p><p>Michael is one of GTA 5's three main playable characters, and fans have been waiting for a long time to interact with him again after the events of the main story. A GTA Online expansion from 2021 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-new-dlc-confirms-michael-is-still-alive-after-gta-5-story/1100-6499135/" data-ref-id="1100-6499135">confirmed that Michael was still alive</a>. In the soon-to-release A Safehouse in the Hills expansion, he's back--and he looks older.

A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-adding-story-dlc-featuring-gta-5s-franklin-and-dr-dre/1100-6498737/" data-ref-id="1100-6498737">previous DLC for GTA Online focused on Franklin</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-why-gta-5-trevor-dlc-was-reportedly-scrapped/1100-6524713/" data-ref-id="1100-6524713">plans for a Trevor-focused expansion were apparently canceled.</a></p><p>Actor Ned Luke, who plays Michael, responded to Rockstar's announcement by saying, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1996971077998637459" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Daddy's back bitches."</a></p><p>Michael returns to Los Santos in the update on December 10, and the major focus of the expansion are new mansions in expensive neighborhoods that players can buy and live in. Players can spend their ill-gotten gains on mansions from Prix Luxury Real Estate. The homes are massive and contain things that rich people like, including trophy cabinets, salons, and huge garages. There are also animal kennels, and this means the new GTA Online update is adding personal pets as well.</p><p>There is also a new AI Assistant in the game, and given Rockstar's propensity for parody, it's possible the AI will have some lines that skewer the modern trend of AI assistants in the real world. You can hear some of the AI's voice lines in the trailer.</p><p>What's more, players should remember that they have until December 7 to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-free-right-now-lets-you-get-a-big-discount-on-new-mansions/1100-6536179/" data-ref-id="1100-6536179">complete special missions</a> to earn major discounts on buying the new mansions that are coming to the game on December 10.</p><p>In addition to ongoing support for GTA Online, Rockstar is developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> and will launch the game in November 2026, following multiple delays.</p>

            <guid>1374493</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Warner Bros. Discovery has been shopping around for a new owner the past few months, and this morning, they entered negotiations with a new winner; <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">Netflix won over Paramount and Comcast</a>. The deal, which combines cash and stock, will see the <em>Stranger Things</em> streaming service acquire Warner Bros. for $82.7 million, while Discovery Global will spin off into a separate, independent company before the acquisition. Warner Bros. owns many major media brands, such as HBO and DC, &nbsp;as well as Warner Bros. Games, a publisher that owns several major game developers. While this part of the deal was previously unclear, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games"><em>Game Developer</em> has confirmed</a> that this division will be acquired by Netflix as well.</p><p>The inclusion of Warner Bros. Games is ignored in the initial press release (the only games mentioned are <em>Squid Game </em>and <em>Game of Thrones</em>), and <em>Game Developer</em> reports that a conference call held this morning only briefly suggested the game publisher would be a part of the deal. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games"><em>Game Developer's</em> Chris Kerr writes</a>, "Warner Bros. Games was briefly referenced during a conference call held this morning, when the Mortal Kombat logo was shown on a 'Business Overview' slide to highlight Warner Bros.' wider game and consumer product exploits—but that blink-and-you'll-miss-it-moment was largely it." In a later call with a representative of Warner Bros. Discovery, however, <em>Game Developer </em>confirmed that the Warner Bros. Games division would be a part of Netflix's deal.</p><p><em>Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, and the Batman: Arkham series are just a few of the game series Netflix will own.</em></p><hr><p>Warner Bros. Games owns several major gaming studios. There's Netherrealm Studios (known for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection/chronicled-kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>), Avalanche (developers of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hogwarts-legacy/a-potion-well-brewed">Hogwarts Legacy</a>), Rocksteady (known for the Arkham series and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/a-new-report-details-how-a-troubled-development-led-to-suicide-squad-kill-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="05c73582-6d92-444a-ab3e-0821b01ab35e" data-entity-substitution="canonical">the recent Suicide Squad game</a>), and TT Games (known for the licensed Lego games, like Lego Star Wars and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/27/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-the-next-arkham-game-youve-been" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6ddac429-cbe0-4568-ba2d-fe81182bcbb7" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Lego Batman</a>). There are also several WB Games studios, most notably WB Montréal, which developed Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights.</p><p>Netflix has attempted to break into the gaming scene in recent years, offering a wide range of mobile games as a part of a Netflix subscription, including apps like Cut the Rope, indie hits like Dead Cells, and even Rockstar ports like Red Dead Redemption and GTA: San Andreas. Netflix has also acquired several game studios, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc5bdf17-9d59-46dd-adfb-21cbbf2eafb8" data-entity-substitution="canonical">like Oxenfree developer Night School Studios</a>. Netflix is currently <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-partners-with-netflix-for-game-adaptation-of-a-major">collaborating with Life is Strange creators Don't Nod</a> on a mysterious game adaptation of a "major IP". Still, it's unclear how far these efforts have gotten them, and adding major console developers to its portfolio could make a huge difference.</p><p>It will likely be a while before we see the results of this merger; the transaction process is lengthy and is estimated to last 12-18 months. This also assumes antitrust regulatory bodies don't get involved to slow the process, and with a deal of this size, it would not be surprising. The last deal we covered on this scale was Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which fought a major legal battle but ultimately succeeded. The jury is still out, however, on whether that merger was good for consumers or employees, as Microsoft has since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-of-employees-cancels-perfect-dark-everwild-and-more-xbox" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d624b4b-915a-4605-840e-eca886d645df" data-entity-substitution="canonical">laid off thousands of employees</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/xbox-is-shutting-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee67f007-444c-47ee-ba02-5c106da54e43" data-entity-substitution="canonical">closed several major studios</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/19/xbox-console-prices-will-increase-again-next-month">raised the prices of its consoles</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-getting-an-overhaul-and-a-50-percent-price-increase" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="38410bb2-8067-4828-aaaa-1faa408a2a69" data-entity-substitution="canonical">subscription service</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/05/netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-and-its-games-division-including-netherrealm-rocksteady]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, boss of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, has named his game of the year - it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>"Expedition 33 is really unique and amazing," Howard told Eurogamer's social producer Mat Jones when asked for his game of the year choice, before name-checking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 as well.</p>
<p>"I think Expedition 33 is a really unique piece of art in so many ways," he added, doubling down on his choice.</p>

<p>It's certainly a great choice, but also rounds off a rivalry from earlier this year. Bethesda shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> two days before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, with both also available on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>But that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">didn't scupper the release of Expedition 33</a>, as publisher Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all". After all, both games represent opposing Western and Japanese ends of the RPG spectrum.</p>
<p>Expedition 33 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">sold over 5m copies worldwide</a> across all formats and is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">frontrunner at next week's The Game Awards with a record-breaking 12 nominations</a>. So it's not just Howard's favour the game has won.</p>
<p>The game has also been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-xbox-game-passs-biggest-third-party-success-2025">success for Xbox Game Pass as the subscription service's biggest third-party release of the year</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3449ea41b04fe"><a title="Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World DK Spaceport" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3449ea41b04fe/donkey-kong-in-mario-kart-world-dk-spaceport.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> may have just received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mario-kart-world-has-been-updated-to-version-1-4-0-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">a rather hefty update</a>, fans of the Switch 2 launch game have been eagerly anticipating any potential DLC that will come to the racer. And a recent datamine of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> has brought all of those hopes and dreams to the surface (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-set-to-finally-acknowledge-donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-character-and-fans-are-now-convinced-the-timing-points-to-mario-kart-world-dlc">IGN</a>!).</p>
<p>So, some context: earlier this week, Nintendo updated its news app with a suite of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-today-mobile-app-update-adds-a-new-donkey-kong-theme">Donkey Kong themes</a>, with many of them seemingly inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Fans decided to datamine the themes and see which Kong characters would be appearing in the future and over on Famiboards, user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/donkey-kong-community-st2-ohhh-bananza.14427/page-64#post-2086247">MondoMega shared the results</a>, and there were a few surprises.</p>
<p>Now, beyond this point, we'll be going into <strong>big Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> <strong>spoilers</strong>, so if you haven't beaten the game yet and want to be surprised, then stop reading right now; the spoilers will be after the image.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c3b2a8231e02"><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c3b2a8231e02/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Watch out, spoilers below! — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It turns out, none other than King K. Rool will be featuring on the app on 15th December. Nintendo has rarely acknowledged the villainous croc in recent years, besides his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, and Donkey Kong Bananza's endgame — and his role as the final boss — was a huge surprise to many. Kritters will also be appearing a few days prior, on 9th.</p>
<p>Now, why would Nintendo have K. Rool pop up on the calendar on 15th December? Honestly, it may well be a harmless bit of promotion. Nintendo features multiple characters unrelated to game releases on the app.</p>
<p>But the timing of this update, and all of the assets coming from Bananza (you can see all of the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong">datamined animations on Mario Wiki</a> - beware of spoilers, obviously) has people fervently speculating; will King K. Rool be added to Mario Kart World?</p>
<p>It's not just baseless speculation, either; shortly after Bananza launched, eagle-eyed players noticed that both King K. Rool <em>and</em> Void Kong's voices <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/">were listed in Mario Kart World's credits</a>, but neither character was in the game.</p>
<p>So will we be getting some DLC news soon? The Game Awards are next week, but Nintendo rarely makes an appearance at the ceremony, with its biggest announcements there being Bayonetta Origins and a variety of Smash Bros. DLC. Could the Big N buck the trend in 2025? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>For now, take this with a pinch of salt. We'd <em>love</em> to see K. Rool in a kart, but we won't get our hopes up just yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s taken a lot to get here, but deep at the bottom of the Great Mines in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/Metroid-Prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, Samus faces the greatest challenge yet on the planet Viewros. You know it’s going to be a rough time when you’re fighting something Omega in a Metroid game…</p>
<p>Now, obviously, <strong>this guide contains spoilers </strong>for Metroid Prime 4, so <strong>stop reading at this point if you are not currently at the final battle of the Great Mines</strong> in the game.</p>
<p>OK… so everyone that’s still here would like some helpful hints? Let’s go.</p>


<h2>Great Mines Omega Boss – First Phase</h2>
<h3>Wall Crawler</h3>
<p>The Omega boss in the Great Mines is a pretty challenging one to tackle, and it fights you in two modes, moves quickly and has long periods of invulnerability.</p>
<p>To start, the Omega Griever scurries around from side to side, high up on the walls of the battle arena. From there, t regularly stops and fires a series of green globs of gloop that slow you and deal damage over time if they hit. Look out for it winding up to start spitting and try to dodge and jump to the sides to evade.</p>


<p>While in this mode, the Omega Griever is hiding its weak spot on the chest and won’t take any damage, but it can be staggered. You need to aim to hit the fleshy coloured parts of its body, as opposed to the black armoured or green glowing sections –&nbsp;you’ll know you’re hitting when it glows gold. Just rapid fire the beam cannon during this and try to lead the target as it moves. The difficulty is that the Omega Griever can dash and break your lock-on, so be ready to quickly release and retarget.</p>
<p>Once enough hits have landed, the Omega Griever will be fatigued and drop to reveal the red weak spot on its chest. Hit this with as much damage as possible –&nbsp;a Super Missile does the trick! –&nbsp;and it will drop to the floor.</p>

<h3>Floor Battle</h3>
<p>Now that the Griever is on the floor, it gets more inventive with its attacks. Here’s what you need to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Sticky Green Gloop</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever projectile vomits green gloop in a cone to its front. This will slow and damage Samus, and you need to mash A to free yourself.<br>
<strong>Claw Attack</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever gets close and swipes with its big arms in turn. Try to keep your distance and jump or dodge away.<br>
<strong>Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever slams on the floor, creating a shockwave that you can avoid by jumping over the top.<br>
<strong>Tongue Grab</strong> –&nbsp;Whipping out its long tentacle-like tongue, the Griever tries to grab Samus and draw her in. Deal as much damage to the tongue as possible while grabbed to get free.</p>

<p>During this phase you need to keep blasting, aiming for exposed fleshy limbs to stun the Omega Griever. Once stunned it slumps to the ground, but its weak spot is still covered. Change to the morph ball, roll under and lay some bombs quickly. This now puts the Omega Griever into a proper damage phase, leaning back to expose its chest.</p>

<p>Unload everything you have with super missiles and charged beam shots, but beware that it can unleash a gloop attack and escape once the stunlock is up.</p>

<h2>Omega Griever – Second Phase</h2>
<p>After taking around one third damage, the Omega Griever will try to escape and crash through a part of the wall, creating some ammo and health that you can absorb with while charging up a beam shot. It also causes some basic and explosive Grievers to spawn. Take them out quickly and it will start to crawl around the walls once more.</p>

<p>It moves a bit quicker now, and has more crusted black armour that is truly invulnerable, but it’s the same process of hitting the fleshy bits to stun, and then the weak spot to drop the Omega Griever to the floor.</p>
<p>Once on the floor, prepare yourself for variants of the same attacks and one new one:</p>
<p><strong>Big Green Ball</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever rolls up and throws a big green ball at Samus. Keep moving to avoid.<br>
Leaping Claw Attack –&nbsp;Now there are up to three swipes and the Griever will leap forward to try and hit Samus.<br>
<strong>Double Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;It now hits the ground in quick succession. Just time a late double jump<br>
Sticky Green Gloop &amp; Tongue Grab are the same.</p>

<p>Again, keep hitting exposed flesh, morph ball and bomb its chest when stunned, and Super Missile the chest when you can.</p>
<h2>Omega Griever Third Phase</h2>
<p>Once down to its final third of health, the Omega Griever again escapes and smashes into the wall, summons lesser Grievers and grows more armour. It might be faster now, but follow the same methods as before to get it down to the ground.</p>
<p>Once on the ground be aware of new and modified attacks:</p>
<p><strong>Laser Beam</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever does a full 360º&nbsp;laser beam attack that you need to jump over to avoid. This does also leave a temporary gas cloud at the edge of the arena, so don’t get too far away.<br>
<strong>Quad Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;Two double ground pounds from its lower and upper arms. Time your double jumps to avoid.<br>
Quad Claw Attack –&nbsp;It’s just four back-to-back claw attacks. Keep your distance.</p>

<p>Keep hitting exposed flesh, and get to that weak point!</p>
<h2><strong>Omega Griever Trick Phase!</strong></h2>
<p>Eventually the Omega Griever falls, flopping to the ground and dropping a power up… but wait! It’s a trap!</p>

<p>The Omega Griever grabs you when you get close and starts sapping your life. Shoot it a ton in the face to be released and go for one last ground fight phase. You know what to do and everything it can do by now. Finish the fight!</p>
<hr>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve just earned the final major upgrade in the game, and are into the final stretch. You now need to head back out, but there’s one last thing you should do in the Great Mines before leaving: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-where-to-find-scout-bot-guide/">look for the Scout Bot</a>.</p>

<p>Warner Bros president David Zaslav says the deal combines "two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world", while Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the acquisition will help to "define the next century of storytelling".

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-pushes-playstation-5-pro-at-its-black-friday-low-while-xbox-series-consoles-stay-full-price-2000650666</link>
            <guid>1374445</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now a full week out from Black Friday, but it looks like someone forgot to tell Sony. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Pro on sale for $101 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This latest model of the console has recently been priced as high as $750, but for the holiday season, you can grab the system of just $649.</a></p>
<h2>The PS5 Has No Games</h2>
<p data-start="136" data-end="775">Alrighty, we all love to go online and make jokes. The recurring meme around the PS5 is that the system “has no games.” It’s become a tired bit at this point. When you step back from the jokes and actually look at what the console has to offer several years into its lifespan, the idea that the PS5 is starving for content just doesn’t hold up. While it would have been nice to have a more exclusives, the current library is anything but empty.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The PS5 Has Tons of Games</h2>
<p data-start="777" data-end="1567">A standout title of this generation is Ghost of Yōtei. This visually striking and mechanically tight action game that showcases the PS5’s graphical and performance capabilities better than anything in its wake. Then there’s Returnal, a fast-paced third-person shooter with roguelike elements that blends frenetic combat with an eerie atmosphere reminiscent of classic Metroid titles. It’s challenging, stylish, and moody. Gotta love it. And of course, Astro Bot marks a triumphant return to the 3D mascot platformer, a genre we’ve been missing for far too long. This game is a charming, heartfelt celebration of PlayStation’s history, packed with creativity from start to finish. The game’s quality and infectious fun earned it the title of 2024’s <em data-start="1508" data-end="1526">Game of the Year</em> at The Game Awards—well-deserved.</p>


<p data-start="1569" data-end="2375">If you happened to skip the PlayStation 4 generation entirely, the PS5 becomes an even more enticing system. You’ll find a treasure trove of beloved titles waiting to be experienced for the first time, with some receiving enhancements specifically for Sony’s latest console. Games like The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II continue to dominate discussions about storytelling in video games. The first entry is widely regarded as one of the strongest narratives the medium has ever produced, while the second remains divisive—but passionately defended by many fans who appreciate its bold thematic choices. Regardless of where you ultimately land, both games offer emotionally charged journeys through a post-apocalyptic world that became iconic enough to inspire a major HBO adaptation. Worth checking out at the very least.</p>
<p data-start="2377" data-end="2801">For players who want access to a large back catalog without purchasing every title individually, PlayStation Plus Premium is an excellent gateway. The subscription grants access to hundreds of games spanning multiple PlayStation generations. You can dive into acclaimed modern titles like Control, Kingdom Hearts III, and Final Fantasy VII Remake, as well as older classics that shaped the platform’s legacy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Witcher’s Ciri actor has stated that she spent some time considering whether they should leave the series, along with Henry Cavill. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Witcher series first had Henry Cavill playing Geralt of Rivia; however, he had to leave the show before it ended, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-season-four-first-clip-hemsworth-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Hemsworth</a> stepping in to wrap up the rest of the seasons as Geralt. Henry Cavill’s leaving was shocking news to all the fans, and it seems it was a shock to cast members as well, because one of them considered quitting along with him. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-s-ciri-didn-t-know-henry-cavill-was-leaving-until-a-day-before-the-news-broke">The Witcher’s Ciri Didn’t Know Henry Cavill Was Leaving Until a Day Before the News Broke</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/tv-interviews/freya-allan-interview-the-witcher-netflix-ciri-henry-cavill-3915069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NME</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-witcher-ciri-actor-says-she-considered-quitting-the-show-with-former-star-henry-cavill-hes-the-geralt-i-grew-up-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), The Witcher’s Ciri actor, Freya Allan, opened up about considering quitting with Henry Cavill. Allan spoke about how season 3 of the show was difficult for everyone and how she was only informed about Henry Cavill quitting one day before it was announced to the public. Allan added that she cried as she wanted to complete the series with the guy who had played her “adoptive father”. </p>



<p>Allan added that, for the first time, she began to see what life would be like away from The Witcher and spent a “solid amount of time” considering whether she should quit her role as Ciri alongside Henry Cavill. However, as we all know, she ultimately chose to stay back and make the most of every moment. Allan also talked about how she was inspired to take on Henry’s role after he left, who was always so “knowledgeable and loyal to the books, push for certain lines to be included.” </p>

                <p>AdHoc CEO Michael Choung thinks most studios should avoid episodic releases, a stance he makes clear even as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dispatch-review-fantastic-superhero-tv/1900-6418442/" data-ref-id="1900-6418442">Dispatch</a>--the studio’s debut superhero workplace comedy--has become a runaway success. Choung says the weekly-release format that helped Dispatch explode past 1 million sales in 10 days and put it on track to hit its three-year sales target in just three months was difficult at every turn and an actual "insane thing to do."</p><p>Speaking to technology newsletter <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Knowledge</a>, Choung recalled being warned repeatedly that releasing the game week by week instead of all at once was a terrible idea. But the team believed the format was essential for the story. "What's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a video game, all meshing and rubbing up against each other," he said. The narrative had always been structured episodically, even though it went against industry "conventional wisdom."</p>

      </div>
<p>Despite internal debate, AdHoc settled on releasing two episodes weekly rather than dropping the game all at once, splitting it into halves, or spacing out individual episodes. The bet paid off dramatically. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered," Choung explained. This kind of schedule created a sense that "the train is leaving the station, but not just yet--I can still make it," which encouraged players to jump in. Contrary to expectations that week-two numbers would fall, concurrent users kept doubling with each release.</p><p>"Those things, we anticipated. I don't think we anticipated the scale of it," he said.</p><p>Still, Choung insists this approach shouldn't become a trend. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!” he said. While AdHoc would be "thrilled" to see others succeed with the model, he stresses that it is grueling and risky.</p><p>Beyond release strategy, AdHoc has also drawn attention for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-studio-weighs-in-on-the-ai-debate-in-gaming/1100-6536310/" data-ref-id="1100-6536310">rejecting AI as a replacement for creative roles.</a> "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," said creative director Nick Herman. "Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative."</p>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has shared his thoughts on the use of AI in video games, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>Howard sat down with Eurogamer's social producer Mat Jones at an event for the second season of Fallout earlier this week. While much of the discussion focused on the Amazon series, Mat took the chance to ask Howard about AI, which remains a hotly debated topic within the industry.</p>

<p>"I view it as a tool," Howard told Mat. "Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.</p>
<p>"But, I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. </p>
<p>"I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop."</p>
<p>"That's our view on it," the Bethesda head closed. "But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special."</p>
<p>Howard's words come as more and more developers are dipping their toes - or at times their whole foot - into the technology. AI has been used across all levels of game development, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPCs like those in the recently-released Where Winds Meet</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, reported that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. In 2025, that number is likely to be higher, and a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines as we march confidently towards the end of the year. Just this afternoon, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>
<p>For more from Howard, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-boss-and-rpg-lover-todd-howard-names-his-2025-game-of-the-year-and-it-shouldnt-come-as-a-big-surprise">Bethesda exec also recently revealed his game of the year</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">potential for an Elder Scrolls adaptation</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Netflix announced this morning that it’s <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros?ref=aftermath.site"><u>acquiring Warner Bros</u></a>, in an $82.7 billion deal that will see the streamer take control of HBO, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hbo-max-warner/"><u>HBO Max</u></a>, and WB’s TV and film studios. Reportedly, the sale will also include WB Games, announced in <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-mortal-kombat-dc-universe-1236436062/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>June </u></a>as becoming part of the WB “streaming and studios” division that Netflix has purchased. This means that Netflix, a company that seems to have no idea what to do with the games studios it already owns, could own more games studios.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Game Developer</u></a>’s Chris Kerr received confirmation from a WB spokesperson that WB Games is going to Netflix, following what was reportedly a brief appearance of the Mortal Kombat logo in a Netflix conference call this morning. WB Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-could-own-all-these-warner-bros-game-studios-soon/2900-7310/?ref=aftermath.site#14"><u>includes studios</u></a> like Rocksteady, who make the Arkham games; Avalanche, who made <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>; and Lego games maker TT Games. Previously, WB Games restructured around–<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad/"><u>shudder</u></a>–IP like Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and DC. Netflix noted <em>Game of Thrones </em>and DC specifically in its press release about the sale, writing “Beloved franchises, shows and movies such as <em>The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones,</em> <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and the DC Universe will join Netflix’s extensive portfolio including <em>Wednesday, Money Heist, Bridgerton, Adolescence </em>and <em>Extraction</em>, creating an extraordinary entertainment offering for audiences worldwide.”</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:t53ijuodvbcjbislhyu6te4r/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7aod3dpxs2n" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreie4jtm6iqvtdjefv54ggjo3pfp7qj7ebbxdodkvnp4kakwhtzuwd4"><p lang="en">I also attended the full Netflix conference call discussing the proposed deal and the VAST majority of chatter was focused on film and television (and IP ownership). 

This 'Business Overview' slide contained the only mention of WB's video game business.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:t53ijuodvbcjbislhyu6te4r?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Kerr (@kerrblimey.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:t53ijuodvbcjbislhyu6te4r/post/3m7aod3dpxs2n?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-05T14:14:59.104Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>That Netflix doesn’t seem to be touting the games part of this deal is perhaps no surprise. After dipping its toe into games as early as 2018’s <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em> (which it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-to-remove-black-mirror-bandersnatch-from-platform-in-an-effort-to-ditch-interactive-programming?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pulled from the platform</u></a> earlier this year), Netflix has been clumsily ramping its games efforts up and down. After <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/expanding-our-games-team-with-the-acquisition-of-night-school-studio?ref=aftermath.site"><u>buying</u></a> <em>Oxenfree </em>developer Night School in 2021 and opening <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23373053/netflix-video-game-studio-development/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>some games studios</u></a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2022</u></a>, Netflix has been closing and selling studios and changing its strategy since. A AAA game reportedly in development from Netflix’s California studio was cancelled when <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the studio was shut down</u></a> in 2024; Netflix went on to <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-closed/"><u>close Boss Fight</u></a>, the studio behind its <em>Squid Game</em> mobile game, earlier this year, and just this week it sold <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Cozy Grove</u></em></a> developer Spry Fox back to its founders. At the same time, Netflix has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>rehashing</u></a> an effort to focus on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-11-14/netflix-games-on-tv-how-to-play-boggle-pictionary-tv-games?ref=aftermath.site"><u>TV-based social games</u></a>, as well as games for kids, offering games on its service like <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>GTA</em>, and tie-ins to its own programming (despite, again, closing the studio that made its <em>Squid Game</em> tie-in).</p><p>None of this has thus far equated to a comprehensive, successful games strategy. As <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-closed/"><u>Nicole wrote</u></a> when Boss Fight was shuttered:</p><blockquote>[P]eople don't come to Netflix for games. It’s likely many people don't even know the company offers them—the disconnect between Netflix on your TV and its games on your phone doesn't necessarily work in favor of the company. Research company Omdia reported in June that Netflix’s games lineup increased user time spent by less than .5%, according to Reuters, which certainly doesn’t seem like a win for the extending audience engagement Peters spoke of in the earnings call. Netflix's strategy, as described on Tuesday in the financial earnings call, remains impossibly broad, even as Peters said the company was focusing its efforts on “a few identified verticals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>That a company with no idea what it’s doing in games would now own <em>even more games</em> feels like a recipe for disaster. If Netflix is actively interested in WB's game offerings at all, it could want them for the same reason WB wanted them–for the <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav/"><u>tie-ins</u></a>– but it’s already shown itself to be unable to handle the opportunities it currently has in that space. Not that WB is a model of success here either; it closed three studios back in February, including one working on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODkzMTgwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTM2NjA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJDMzlEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.I9EjU4x5-ZG-gThi468SKf5IF8l5lg2jKLB9q7K5vyM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Wonder Woman</u></a> game. At both Netflix and WB, the men in suits seem to get as far as “people like video games, and also movies and TV” and then have no idea what to do next, costing games workers their jobs in the process.</p><p>And all <em>this</em> is to say nothing of all the potential ramifications of one company owning even <em>more</em> media properties and streaming platforms, with Netflix already <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-warner-bros-movies-theaters-buying-studio-1236601073/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>musing</u></a> about its plans for theatrical releases. The deal still needs to go through regulatory review, and the restructure that sees WB Games fall under the company’s streaming offerings is <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-post-separation-company-names-executive-leadership-teams-1236472168/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>still in progress</u></a>, so there are a lot of unknowns in terms of how things could look once, and if, everything is finalized. But there’s no reason to assume Netflix will suddenly get its shit together if it ends up with more games studios to flail around with. Maybe a handful of companies <em>shouldn’t</em> own everything? </p>

			<p>Today, Netflix announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Warner Bros., including HBO Max, HBO, its film, television, and gaming studios, for $82.7 billion.</p>



<p>As you may recall, Warner Bros. Discovery was formed following the merger of AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia division with Discovery, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-split-up-warnermedia-discovery-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced on May 17, 2021</a>, and officially completed on April 8, 2022. Around a year ago, however, WBD executives decided to split the division into two separate units: the more profitable Streaming &amp; Studios and the less profitable Global Linear Networks, with the split expected to be complete by mid-2026.</p>



<p>Ever since that announcement, speculation ran rampant that the goal was to sell off the more appealing Streaming &amp; Studios to the highest bidder, and that's exactly what happened today. Previous rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-considering-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-and-studios-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Sony might have been interested. As of last month, WBD execs were officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-discovery-is-officially-up-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evaluating different offers from multiple parties</a>. It's not surprising that Netflix won, given its financial resources.</p>



<p>There was the lingering doubt of whether such an acquisition would include WB's gaming studios. Surprisingly, it seems that the answer is positive. This means Avalanche Software (Hogwarts Legacy), NetherRealm Games (Mortal Kombat, Injustice), Rocksteady Games (Batman: Arkham, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League), and TT Games (LEGO) will go under Netflix's control. The WB Games division was <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank">restructured</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, following the closure of Monolith Productions (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War), PlayerFirst Games (MultiVersus), and San Diego Studio, as well as</span> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of its CEO</a>, David Haddad. </p>



<p>The goal was to focus entirely on the four big owned franchises: DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat. Whether Netflix agrees with the strategy remains to be seen, though. Their gaming efforts so far have been mixed. They <a href="https://wccftech.com/night-school-studio-is-the-first-game-developer-purchased-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> Oxenfree developer Night School Studios and a few mobile developers, including Spry Fox, which was recently sold back to its original owners. In 2022, they <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-aims-to-have-50-mobile-games-available-by-the-end-of-2022/" target="_blank">expanded their mobile game offerings</a>&nbsp;available through the subscription model and also&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-reportedly-working-on-aaa-pc-third-person-action-rpg/" target="_blank">founded a studio</a>&nbsp;to develop</span> a triple-A action RPG designed by several industry veterans. However, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed down that studio</a> about a year ago.</p>



<p>Right now, it's anyone's guess what their gaming strategy will be. Below, you can find prepared statements from Netflix and WB executives regarding the acquisition, which is expected to close within twelve to eighteen months.</p>



<p>Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, stated:</p>



<p><em>Our mission has always been to entertain the world. By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends—with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters, and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.</em></p>



<p>Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix, added:</p>



<p><em>This acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come. Warner Bros. has helped define entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities. With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create—giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders.</em></p>



<p>David Zaslav, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said:</p>



<p><em>Today’s announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most. For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world’s attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world’s most resonant stories for generations to come.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[13 years later, the bold and terrifying sci-fi game Routine is finally here]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/838639/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-development</link>
            <guid>1374409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It has been 13 long years since Aaron Foster last <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3507340/routine-sci-fi-horror-game">spoke</a> to <em>The Verge</em>. Back then, Foster’s tiny, three-person studio Lunar Software was touting sci-fi horror game <em>Routine</em> with a striking vision: Foster hoped to suck players into the desolate eeriness of its moon base setting, which was equal parts immersive and grounded. Foster ended that interview by swerving a release date question. With 13 years of hindsight, it reads like an all-timer understatement. “Making a good game is more important than a hard-set deadline,” he said. “So we will keep it loose for now.”</p><p>Now, nearly a decade and a half on, <a href="https://www.routinegame.com/"><em>Routine </em>has been released on Steam and Xbox</a>. Better yet — miraculously, even — the game appears to bear little trace of its turbulent and protracted development. This is visually ravishing hard sci-fi with some of the most committed diegetic design I’ve ever seen in a video game. There is no heads-up display and no health gauge, nor is there any omniscient text directing you where to go. Instead, you must pay close attention to everything. Such is the concentration the game demands, likely causing you to literally lean into the screen; it can feel as if you are actually there, inhabiting the physical space of this magnificently believable lunar base.</p><p>Foster has made the game for a very specific type of video game aficionado, himself included. “I just appreciate it when I’m playing a game that I forget that I’m actually playing a game,” he says in a new interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “Often UI brings you out of the experience.”</p><p>Foster, who serves as art and design lead on the game, says that he and his partner, assistant lead artist and designer Jemma Hughes, go to great lengths to foster this kind of experience in games not expressly designed for them. The pair played online multiplayer survival game <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F440900%2FConan_Exiles%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Conan Exiles</em></a> with a self-imposed modifier: Neither person is allowed to look at the map. “We could only navigate the world through memory,” says Foster, “and that changes how you interact with the spaces.”</p><p>Your Cosmonaut Assistance Tool — or CAT — is the best example of how hard Lunar Software has pushed this diegetic approach in<em> Routine</em>. CAT is an ungainly multifunctional electronic device with a chunky, 1980s-inspired look. You can hold it like a firearm, aiming the reticule through a small, low-res screen, pinging off bolts of electricity at the imposing robots that stalk the station. You can also hold CAT up, revealing buttons on its side and a bar showing how much battery life remains. Press one button and, if you’re standing next to a terminal with a projector, the in-game menu (tracking objectives and other useful information) appears. There is no way to access this menu by conventionally pressing Start or Esc; the menu must be accessed <em>through</em> the game world.</p><p>CAT, and the overall sinister atmosphere, is visible in the very first 2012 <a href="https://youtu.be/FnhYRaotzdg">trailer</a>. Not long before, Foster had quit his job as a 3D environment artist at Eurocom, a large UK-based studio that specialized in licensed games. He was feeling burned out and creatively unfulfilled, working on personal projects in the evening. This grueling double life caused him to overdose on caffeine. He wasn’t able to focus on any of his work, and he suffered from nosebleeds.</p><p>At first, Foster saw <em>Routine</em> as a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F520720%2FDear_Esther_Landmark_Edition%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Dear Esther</em></a><em>-</em>esque walking simulator. “I thought I could make something visually distinct, if not with the great writing of Dan Pinchbeck,” he says. Soon after, programmer Pete Dissler came on board, which meant more involved systems could be implemented. In 2011, Foster, Dissler, and Hughes formed Lunar Software, moving into an apartment together in Preston, an industrial town in the north of England. They became like a tightly knit three-piece band. Foster and Hughes still live in the same flat; they became a couple in the early stages of production.</p><p>For a time, <em>Routine</em>’s production went smoothly. The team built environments and mechanics, while Mick Gordon, composer and audio designer on titles like <em>Prey </em>and <em>Doom</em>, joined the trio, designing its intricately machinic soundscape (listen closely for the ambient whirs and clicks of the door’s internal mechanisms). Yet slowly, the game began to lose focus. “We tried to solve problems with design by just throwing more things at it, more environments to navigate, more this, more that. None of it added anything to the experience,” says Foster. “It felt like a very shallow experience that we weren’t creatively in a good spot to fix.”</p><p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/AOiY_QfOCwE">release date trailer</a> arrived in 2016; the team missed that deadline. Health issues struck various team members; what savings they had ran out. Foster and Hughes were reliant on Hughes’ parents for financial support. “We didn’t pay ourselves a wage,” says Hughes. “We were running on fumes.” Some of the team took on contract work; others did odd jobs. In effect, development shut down.</p><p>Then, in 2020, flickers of life. Lunar had pitched a prototype for a different game about a bounty-hunting frog, which they’d been working on as a means to keep their spirits up, to Raw Fury. The publisher was more interested in revisiting Lunar’s shelved project. “They’re like, ‘Aren’t you the folks that are working on <em>Routine</em>? What’s your feelings on returning to that project?’” recalls Foster. “‘Very, very fucking positive,’” he told them.</p><p>Many developers spend years toiling on their passion projects: Acclaimed autobiographical life simulator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791220/consume-me-review-steam"><em>Consume Me</em></a> took 10 years to make; lauded Metroidvanias <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGTEF6LfzqM"><em>Ultros</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, and gorgeous soccer adventure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/664363/despelote-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Despelote</em></a>, all took approximately seven years. There are many tales of blockbuster development hell: <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> and the ongoing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/16/23557146/beyond-good-and-evil-2-not-canceled-development-hell"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a>. But <em>Routine</em> is unique. Early into this second iteration of the project, Foster and his colleagues had a realization. “We were essentially doing a remake of our own game,” he says. “But without the game having ever been released. It was very strange.”</p><div><p>“We were essentially doing a remake of our own game.”</p></div><p>Chief among Lunar’s initial tasks on the second run was creating practically every asset from scratch as they shifted production from the relatively humdrum Unreal Engine 3 to its successor. The team borrowed a texturing technique from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/4/5960489/star-citizen"><em>Star Citizen</em></a> (another game languishing in its own development hell), and the lighting looks so ravishing because it has been baked into the levels, diffusing naturally through every ominously long corridor.</p><p>During <em>Routine</em>’s most stressful moments, lumbering foes, likely having spotted your helmet poking out from behind a counter, click into thundering gear. There are doors that you can close to halt them momentarily, except — oh no! — you may fumble closing one because you must aim your cursor at the terminal screen itself rather than locking on to it automatically. It’s an interface style that was cribbed from <em>Doom 3</em>, and is representative of <em>Routine</em> as a whole: It riffs on the familiar yet manages to feel fresh.</p><p>Given all of that work, how did the team maintain motivation on the project for all that time? “We just couldn’t live in a world where <em>Routine</em> didn’t release,” says Hughes. Foster, 26 when the project started and now 40, cites devotion as the primary reason behind how they kept going. “If we didn’t love <em>Routine</em> as much as we do, it wouldn’t have gotten us through the hard times.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/838639/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-development]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Postal developers Running With Scissors have revealed... and now cancelled Postal: Bullet Paradise, a spin-off shooter created by Goonswarm Studios. It seems Bullet Paradise may have featured some AI-generated material, which has prompted an evidently massive backlash among the Postal faithful in the literal two whole days since the project's announcement. Gosh.
</p>
<p>
"After revealing POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned POSTAL Community," reads a statement from Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi, emailed to RPS this afternoon. "The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.
</p>
<p>
"We've always been, and will always be, transparent with our community," Desi continues. "Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we've killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don't).
</p>
<p>
"Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we've always said that our fans are part of the team," it concludes. "Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the POSTAL franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond. We can't wait to share more!"
</p>
<p>
Postal: Bullet Paradise was once "a timeline-hopping, dystopian bullet heaven first-person shooter with POSTAL's signature darkly humorous personality". The project is "no longer available" on Steam, though it still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise/">has a page</a> as of writing.
</p>
<p>
Desi's statement doesn't mention which elements of the game may have been AI-generated, or whether they've taken any steps to confirm this with Goonswarm. I've mailed the devs to ask for comment. Their previous games include Sin Slayers: Meat &amp; Greed and SCP: Control Error.
</p><p>
Assuming this <em>is</em> a case of generative AI, it would be the first time to my knowledge that a publisher has canned a whole game following blowback on the subject from players. Publishers have apologised for games having generated AI elements - see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">11 Bit's response to controversy over The Alters</a> - and taken steps to replace them - see <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-says-ai-generated-art-in-anno-117-was-a-placeholder-which-slipped-through-our-review-process/">Ubisoft and Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> - but yoinking the whole thing from development is quite the escalation. I'll update if we learn more.

              <p>If you missed snapping up a powerful speaker with bold sound from a known brand during Black Friday, Amazon is offering another chance to save big.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">We just spotted the ultra-portable JBL Clip 5 going for $57 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed 29% off its usual (and already affordable) $80 price tag.</a> This deal applies to the classic black model. If you’re looking for something with a bit more personality, several other options are going for less, too. The stunning red and the beautiful blue, for instance, are sitting at $60, after a sweet $10 discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy a three-month free trial of Amazon Music with your purchase, which is going to make vibing and jamming a lot more fun. The only catch is that the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been after a reliable, lightweight speaker, now is the time to act before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry Around</h2>
<p>This portable speaker features a compact frame and includes a fully integrated carabiner with a much wider opening. Slip your fingers through to carry it around, hook it to your backpack, or just toss it in your purse and get going. Since it’s quite lightweight, it doesn’t add unnecessary bulk, either.</p>
<p>Of course, small size doesn’t mean average performance; this speaker punches well above its weight. There’s a powerful driver and passive radiator for bigger, louder JBL Pro Sound with deep, rich bass that brings all your favorite tunes to life. It’s great for energy-filled songs, plus catching up on podcasts on the go. You can even pair it with your laptop or phone while streaming shows for a room-filling, immersive audio experience. Installing the JBL app takes the experience even further by letting you choose between audio options, tweak sound settings, install the latest updates, and more. The speaker is quite strong on its own, but you can always pair two of these with Auracast for an even bigger setup. Planning to host a fun gathering this New Year’s? Ask a friend to bring theirs and enjoy your own mini concert right there in your backyard.</p>



<p>The party goes all night with Clip 5’s strong battery that offers up to 12 hours of playtime on a single. Running low, but don’t want to stop the music? Hit the Playtime Boost to add up to three more hours to your playtime. Translation? Non-stop fun all night (and the next day) long. You can take out on your off-road adventures without a worry. Speaking of off-road adventures, the speaker is made to handle all weather and environmental conditions. This exceptional durability comes from its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating. A few water splashes by the pool or a couple of drops in the sand at the beach won’t hurt the functionality.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been after a power speaker in a portable design that doesn’t put a dent in your wallet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">the JBL Clip 5 is a great option to consider. Amazon is offering it for just $58 today, making the upgrade much more affordable</a>. You’ll also get 90 days free of Amazon Music with your purchase, which gets you instant access to thousands of ad-free songs, ad-free podcasts, offline downloads, and more. It even offers one free audiobook from Audible’s large catalog every month. After the free trial, your subscription will continue at $11 per month ($10 for Prime members), if you choose to keep it.</p>

<p>Legendary game developer Tim Cain has returned to the gaming industry spotlight to team up with Obsidian Entertainment once again, and they’ve confirmed that they’re working on a new game already.</p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Tim Cain helped mastermind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-revealed-what-makes-fallout-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> franchise and co-directed The Outer Worlds, amongst other work. The developer semi-retired several years ago, but has announced that he’s back into the swing of things with Obsidian, and is developing a mystery game.</p>

<p>In a December 5 ‘Cain On Games Update’ on his YouTube channel, Cain discussed what was happening in his life regarding game development and the next steps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m back at Obsidian. I’m there, full-time employee, and in person. So not remote. I’m not a contractor anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Cain explained that while he will have his name attached to at least one other game coming up—due to his relaxed contractor status in recent times—he is now firmly on Obsidian’s books. Cain explained that he’s not at liberty to discuss the new project, and it gives more questions than it does answers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I also can’t talk about the project I’m working on at Obsidian, just because that’s covered under NDA. Don’t bother guessing, you’re not gonna guess right.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cain explains that he’s “A lot less retired now,” and this new game will likely be the center of his focus moving forward.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video and everything said by Cain about the life change.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2 have been the two main games Cain has worked on in the last 10 years. It’ll be interesting to see what the new title is, but it’s hard to imagine it’s not something to do with an RPG!</p>



<p>What do you think Cain is working on? Is it an old IP being brought back to life? Or is Obsidian cooking up yet another franchise?

                <p>Nintendo enthusiasts believe that an announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> DLC is imminent, though it takes a few steps to reach that conclusion.</p><p>Evidence, fans believe, stems from datamined information from the Nintendo Today app, which shares daily bite-sized pieces of news and offers several themes based on various Nintendo franchises. A new Donkey Kong theme came to the app recently, and per datamines (which you can see on <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Wiki</a>), it looks like the app will highlight a character that had a surprise appearance in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p><em>Spoilers for Donkey Kong Bananza to follow!</em></p><p>An intro animation for DK's nemesis, King K. Rool, is purportedly set to feature in the Nintendo Today app on December 15. It'll be the first time Nintendo officially acknowledges his presence in Bananza, since his role was a big plot twist in the game. So, how does that relate to Mario Kart World DLC?</p><p>Back when Mario Kart World launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sharp-eyed players noticed</a> that the Japanese voice performers for K. Rool and Bananza boss Void Kong appeared in the credits, despite their characters not appearing in the kart racer. While it's possible that the two voice actors played different roles in the base game, fans took it as evidence that a Donkey Kong Bananza-themed expansion is coming to Mario Kart World.</p><p>The timing of K. Rool's Nintendo Today animation rolling out a few days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards 2025 streams</a> on December 11 has fans trying to connect some dots, believing that putting K. Rool in the spotlight would tie in well with a possible DLC announcement at the awards show.</p><p>It isn't the most implausible theory--Nintendo has made announcements at The Game Awards in previous years, and the relatively paltry number of costumes for Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World leaves room for a big DK-centered expansion.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, Mario Kart fans are hungry for more. Despite being the marquee launch title for Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-sales-race-ahead-almost-tied-with-switch-2/1100-6533626/" data-ref-id="1100-6533626">sales nearly matching those of the console itself</a>, there hasn't been any acknowledgement or hint of post-release content for Mario Kart World. At the very least, Nintendo has continued to update the game, most recently with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-update-out-now-adds-custom-item-rules-and-more/1100-6536657/" data-ref-id="1100-6536657">big patch that added features</a> like custom item rules.</p>

            <p>It's been an unexpectedly rough year for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. The game, which many assumed would be a massive success after the juggernaut sales of Monster Hunter World, has floundered a little post-launch. Capcom has been eager to point the finger on various factors, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the price of a PS5 being a high barrier to entry</a>, but the fact remains that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the game's sales are lagging behind the ageing Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Rise's DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards">IGN</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda has appealed to players to consider jumping back into the game again, promising various tweaks the devs have made - and are planning to make - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap">have righted the wrongs</a> the game suffered at launch.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Go on, have the video link three days early.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE3wwzzXmkg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>," Tokuda explained. “We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armour.</p><p>"In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users."</p>
<p>This point is notable: many (assumedly now lapsed) players found the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">far too easy</a>, especially by Monster Hunter standards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">The resultant 'overwhelmingly negative' plunge</a> on Steam is partially to blame for the game's lack of stickiness with players, which must have come as something of a shock to Capcom given how loyal MonHun fans typically tend to be.</p>
<p>On the upside, though, various free updates have added more difficult gameplay to the title over the course of the year, and recently we saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> crossover go live with an absolute nightmare of an encounter in the form of Omega Planetes - something even end-game veterans struggled to put down.</p>
<p>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again."</p>
<p>Need more motivation? You're in luck: Capcom today announced the next Monster Hunter Showcase will air on Monday, 8th December 8. The showcase will cover Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4 and provide us with another look at Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.</p><p>It'll be broadcast on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> at 2 PM PT / 10 PM GMT. So far, we know Monster Hunter Wilds TU4 will re-introduce us Gogmazios (an oil-slicked Elder Dragon we've not seen since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-4-ultimate">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a>), expand end-game content, bring in new weapon buffs, start a new seasonal event, apply performance improvements, and more besides.</p>
<p>It launches on December 16 for all platforms. Just in time for the holidays, then.</p>

<p>Vroom for four, and 120fps mode to boot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>3Goo, which has previously published the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gear_club_unlimited_2_-_definitive_edition">Gear.Club</a> series and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wrc_generations">WRC Generations</a> on Nintendo consoles, has announced a brand new multiplayer grand-prix racer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/4pgp-four-player-grand-prix">4PGP: Four-Player Grand Prix</a>, which releases on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, has a phenomenally straight-forward moniker, and we reckon that suits its aims as a no-nonsense 90s-style racer just fine, as the keyword here is "simplicity" in being able to pick up and play, with easy to grasp controls.</p>
<p>That extends to the visuals too, in the clean and simplistic graphical style adopted to bring this arcade speeding to life with 4K and 120fps on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The game also features track "design contributions" from Kenji Sasaki, who of course designed the tracks for little known racers such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> and <strong>Sega Rally</strong>. Hold on, what? Excuse us? Oh, and you've also got a soundtrack by Tomoyuki Kawamura, who did the music for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/sega_rally_championship">Sega Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/virtua_racing">Virtua Racing</a>.

<p>Here's some more deets from the press release:</p>

<p>We like the look of this one, and if 3goo can nail the driving, get the arcade feel just right and give online that works well, this one could fill a proper hole in our Switch libraries when it comes to F1-style racing with pals. We're also totally down for that price point of <strong>$24.99</strong> on Switch 2 and <strong>$19.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>

              <p>Is your Christmas tree missing a little bling? It’s time to add some smart lighting to brighten it up. Govee makes some of our favorite solutions out there, and we just spotted its smart RGBIC Christmas tree lights going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/">On a regular day, these lights would run you around $140, but the retailer just slashed the price by 36%, offering them for just $90 right now</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen them drop to in a long while. It was also originally a Black Friday discount, which managed to survive the main event. You’ll enjoy free delivery on your purchase, which ultimately brings the total down even further. Snap it up quickly, though. Christmas is just around the corner, and we’re expecting these lights to be a popular pick, so both the discount and the stock could run out soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>The box includes 24 string lights, with a total of 480 LED beads. Each line is 6.6ft long and features 20 LEDs, making it great for most trees from 6.5ft to 8ft. There’s an 11.5ft power line attached, which allows you to place the lights anywhere without feeling limited. Installation couldn’t be simpler. The lights come with everything you need to put these up, including mounting rings, bar support, cable ties, and U-shaped straps.</p>
<p>Once up, the upgraded LED design, paired with the densely arranged beads, makes for a much smoother, uniform lighting effect. You can choose from 16 million color options (you read that right), plus over 60 versatile preset modes that have something appropriate for every occasion. If you already have a vision in mind, go DIY using the dedicated app, picking your own colors and styles. You can overlap layers, draw a sketch on the app to get specific patterns on the lights, edit patterns, or share your ideas with the AI bot to create unique effects. Don’t have the time for all of that? The preset modes make it easy to choose one within seconds. The Christmas lighting show, for instance, is bright and offers a nice mix of holiday-appropriate colors. Similarly, the “New Year’s” mode is a bit more vibrant, while the “Winter Warm” option brings cozy energy into your space.</p>



<p>The timer section in the app lets you create specific schedules for your lights. There’s a Sleep option to dim them, and a Wake Up to turn them on gradually. What’s more, the lights can also turn on when you clap your hands. Turn it into a game and see who can light them all up in the shortest time!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about these smart lights that can be used for multiple events. You can pick from a range of colors and preset modes, which means you’re no longer stuck with the basic yellow lighting. Maybe go for something bright during the day, and switch to warmer tones at night; the possibilities are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/"> Amazon is now letting you grab them for just $90, after taking a whopping 36% off their retail price.</a> Make sure you act fast to grab them, because we’re not expecting the discount or the stock to last long. That said, there are plenty of other lighting solutions by Govee going for less, as well. Now is a great time to stock up on everything you’ve had your eyes on, before the prices shoot back up.</p>

              <p>Tim Cain, the legendary developer behind 1997’s seminal RPG <em>Fallout</em>, has withdrawn from his semi-retirement to return to his former haunt, Obsidian Entertainment, as a full-time employee. In a video posted to his popular YouTube channel, Cain explains that he’d moved back to Southern California to rejoin the studio, and is already at work on new projects.</p> <p>Cain’s legacy in video games is deeply enviable. Not only did the <a href="https://chocolateihaveknown.wordpress.com/">dark chocolate-loving developer</a> blast out of the gate with credits on ’90s classics like <em>Stonekeep&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em>, but almost immediately hit a home run with his leading role on the all-time great RPG, 1997’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>. Since then, he project led the fantastic (and fantastically named) <em>Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magic Obscura</em>, was a senior programmer on the sublime&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodline</em>, and was co-director of Obsidian’s 2019 hit,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds</em>. Along the way, he had a hand in <i>The Temple of Elemental Evil</i>, <em>South Park: The Stick of Truth</em>, and <em>Pillars of Eternity.</em></p>

 <p>In the video, Cain really buries the lede about his return to Obsidian after leaving in June 2020, making sure to first inform viewers of the squirrel that bullies him out of walnuts every time he enters his new home. But that more important detail out of the way, Cain explains that he’s fully back at RPG specialists Obsidian, full-time, and in the office, after having contributed work to the recently released <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> remotely as a contractor.</p>  <p>There’s no word yet on which projects Cain might be working on at the studio, but given the only game we know currently in development is <em>Grounded 2</em>, it’s probably a secret. Here’s hoping for <em>Avowed 2</em>, of course, or even a straightforward isometric&nbsp;<em>Pillars</em> follow-up, given that’s Cain’s specialty.</p>
