            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Dk map article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4782dfb7bef11/dk-map-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of fun to be had in smashing the place to tiny little voxel pieces in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, it's easily its biggest draw. People have been into the sweet catharsis of wanton destruction since way back before there were even people. Probably.</p>
<p>However, the one thing that's caught my attention most whilst playing thus far - and I must admit, I'm only around about halfway through the campaign at this point - is the game's absolutely beautiful world map design. I love it.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't have the same level of interactivity and usefulness as some other games do, and sometimes it gets lost when you've dug through miles of terrain, but it's not about that. Donkey Kong Bananza's map's strength lies in how it gives you the actual level you are on, fully realised as adorable 3D miniature, like a diorama that you can swirl around and see exactly what is in front, to the side, above, below and beyond you.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>When you press the map button, the camera zips you up and out of the level to look down upon the earth like some sort of hairy, banana-addled God. What's more, it tallies all of your actions and activities and replicates all the damage you've done across the layer. It's a magic, real-time tracker kind of thing, and it's got me dazzled.</p>
<p>There's almost a game within a game here where you can set points of interest or places you want to get to just for fun, rather than for the sake of progression, and then work through the area both in-game and through the map, jumping seamlessly too and fro, in order to do some satisfying messing around and discovering. I love how it orientates you, too. Jump into this map and direct yourself towards something, then back out and DK is pointed where you are headed.</p>
<p>It also allows you to do fun things with the landscape. I mean, who knows what I could sculpt that great big mountain in the distance into if I really <em>think</em> about it? And when I've decided, I can go into the map to get a bird's eye view on the progress of my mountain that's shaped like Wario's butt. Woah! Wait a minute.... Where did that come from?</p>

<p>The more intricate the level, the more impressed I am. I've spent far too much time spinning these maps around and resetting the terrain so it's all fresh and new and ready to destroy all over again. And, for a game that's got so much going on elsewhere, this ingenious little map really has become the cherry on top for me.</p>
<p>Of course Nintendo is no stranger to the World Of Very Good World Maps™. In fact, one of my earliest and most lasting memories of gaming is how blown away I was by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</a>'s map back in the days when I'd play my full-colour games on a barely working black and white TV. Yes, I am a dinosaur. And a bald one, to boot.</p>
<p>The parallaxing wonder that was A Link to the Past's map though, my goodness. And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/5j835r/map_of_hyrule_legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past/">you got a paper copy of it in the box as well</a>. Halcyon days. It was the first time I'd seen a map and thought of it as an organic and useful part of a game as a whole. It wasn't some stuffy menu that was separated off; it put you above the world, not removed temporarily to the back rooms, still in-game, just from a different perspective. It's amazing how much this adds to the escapism of an adventure. It certainly had 13 year old me more invested in a game than I'd ever been before.</p>

<p>Zelda has continued to innovate and impress in the cartography department, too. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> give us these enormously complex maps that show you where you need to go and where you've just been. They also retain the magic of A Link to the Past's effort by teasing you ahead of time, showing you places that you want to go, intriguing things you want to see or mess with. These maps do their jobs by being a guiding companion, but they also keep you hooked by enhancing the game's ability to embed you in its world.</p>
<p>Then we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, another game that absolutely floored me with its map. Previously I'd found Metroid a little tortuous — sometimes you blame yourself in tough situations, saying you're just not good enough or patient enough to play that type of game. But it was the map's fault! Blame the game, give yourself a mental health break. As soon as you popped in Super Metroid's cartridge, with its incredibly useful maze of a map, everything clicked into place. Ah yes, this is why people like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> and why there are <em>so many</em> Metroidvanias out there. Thanks maps!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> carries on in the same glorious vein; its map is another ludicrously labyrinthian affair, but your path and location remain crystal clear an all times. And the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_trilogy">Prime Trilogy</a> map, well, it's just more of that good gravy. Not as fundamentally game-changing as its predecessors, perhaps, but certainly showing that the love is still there, and now lifted into three dimensions. It makes me sick to think about how complicated creating this stuff must be, which is a sure sign that it's a good thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> is another example of a map I was in love with as a kid. Again, not the most useful, overall, but it doesn't need to be. It looks amazing, it's interactive as you move across the paths that link all the levels together, and it keeps you in the world, in that <em>not-real-life</em> headspace, which is where I belong.</p>
<p>And just like all the other games mentioned, it teases you in the same ways. You immediately need to know where all those little caves go, what that suspicious patch is over there, etc. And all of this is to speak nothing on how the map designs add to, or even speak to, the style, the vibe, and the architecture of the worlds that they're a part of. They fit, they enhance and they improve.</p>

<p>So, whilst smashing the place to a billion beautiful pieces in Bananza, zipping in and out of its map, twirling and zooming, plotting and planning, I've been reminded in a wonderfully nostalgic burst of all this lovely stuff. It's nice to see that, as much as the technology may change and gamers might want different things from the experiences they buy into, Nintendo has stuck to giving us some of the best maps in the industry.</p>
<p>When you think about all these maps, especially with how complex the latest Zelda ones have been, it feels like a bit of a full circle moment that, in DK's latest outing; you get to tear the map apart until there's nothing but the skeleton of a world remaining.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned AMD leaker KeplerL2 has revealed in a series of posts on the NeoGaf board (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mgijwx/keplerl2_xbox_xs_hardware_has_sold_less_than_30/?share_id=Ch1EvdKxiKZjo7CR5NGHO&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Reddit</a>) that the Xbox Series S and X consoles have sold less than 30 million units, according to his estimates based on AMD sales data.</p>



<p><em>They aren't even at 30 million. You don't need third party trackers, you can use AMD's number and Sony's number to figure out Xbox sales. Steam Deck is part of SCBU and counted as a console; Van Gogh and all its variants were developed by SCBU (Semi-Custom Business Unit) and fall under the same reporting as the consoles. Z1/Z2 are repurposed laptop chips (Rembrandt/Phoenix/Strix) and fall under the Client segment.</em></p>



<p><em>It is also important to note that AMD's number is higher than what Sony/Xbox would count as unit sales since it includes chips sold but still in-flight (i.e., being assembled somewhere).<br>So Q3 &lt;100 million console units with ~66 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck would put Xbox Series S and X at a maximum of 29 million. Q4 &gt;100 million console units with ~75 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck means Xbox sold a minimum of 21 million units. So, Xbox sales for this gen range from a minimum of 21 million + Q1/Q2 2025 unit sales to a maximum of 29 million + Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025.</em></p>



<p>This means Sony's PlayStation 5 could have around three times the install base of Microsoft's Xbox duo. The choice to create a lower priced model, the Series S, was not nearly enough to stop the constantly dwindling sales. Even in the last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">otherwise profitable quarter</a>, Xbox hardware sales decreased 22% on a year-over-year basis.</p>



<p>At least the Xbox Series S and X are not sold at a loss anymore, according to KeplerL2, unlike Sony's PlayStation 5:</p>



<p><em>PS5 had a brief period of being even/profitable, but then component prices went up (N7 wafers, GDDR6, and a few others), and it went right back to losing money. As far as I know, the regular PS5 is still sold at a minor loss; only the PS5 Pro is profitable. They did a die shrink for the Series X and raised prices; it should be profitable now.</em></p>

Whether you're a fan of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">Pokémon games</a>, anime, or the trading card game, there is a seemingly endless amount of new content for you to peruse at any given time. There's so much, in fact, that it can almost be hard to find the perfect Pokémon gift for yourself or the fan in your life without trudging through piles of search results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, if you're specifically looking for a really cool Pokémon jigsaw puzzle, I have scouted out this specific topic for you. Below I've listed out some of the very best options currently available on Amazon for both adults and kids of varying ages. Some of these puzzles are a <em>lot</em> more challenging than others, so just make sure you check the piece count before you bite off more than you can chew.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">A good challenge for adults</h3><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218908"><div id="218908" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Pokémon puzzle I'd recommend is for more advanced puzzlers. It's 1,000 pieces and is stamped with the Ravensburger "Challenge" title, meaning it's not going to be a quick one. Featuring all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/pokedex">original 150 Pokémon</a> all in one picture, it's a nostalgic blast from the past and fun to put together. It also comes from Ravensburger, which is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">most-trusted jigsaw puzzle brands</a> out there. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For fans of the video games</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218909"><div id="218909" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for fans of the original video games.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're anything like me, you likely have fond memories of playing Pokémon on your Game Boy for hours on end and this puzzle hits a similar nostalgic vein. This glorious 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle from Buffalo Games showcases the original 150 Pokémon once again, but this time they are pixelated and perfectly organized. With the higher piece count and nice blue border around the edges, this Pokémon puzzle is a great option for anyone looking to proudly frame and display their completed work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the piece count on this puzzle, you should also check out our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">largest puzzles available now</a>. They scale up beyond 40,000 pieces.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For younger kids</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218910"><div id="218910" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first two puzzles on this list are targeted more toward adults, but if you're looking for a good option for younger kids, this 100 piece puzzle is my top pick. It features a ton of fan favorite Pokémon, primarily from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation. You can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-diamond-pearl-platinum-version/Rayquaza">Rayquaza</a> right in the middle there and Pikachu all the way at the bottom. At 100 pieces it's fairly easy for younger kids to piece together while still providing a really cool image for fans of the franchise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Starter option for preschoolers</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218911"><div id="218911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Starter puzzles for preschoolers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a good puzzle gift for kids just getting into puzzles, this four pack is an excellent option. It says it's made for ages 4+, but I got this same pack for my niece and nephew when they were around three years old and they had no problem putting it together. Each puzzle depicts a different set of Pokémon and features between 12 and 48 pieces so kids can scale up the difficulty if they are really into it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3D Master Ball Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">The best Pokemon puzzle gift</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="219020"><div id="219020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3D Master Ball Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>A good gift for all ages.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the absolute <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-toys">best Pokémon toys</a> on the market are Poké Balls. So naturally, there is a 3D puzzle version available. At only 54 pieces, it's fairly easy to put together and even easier to display. It comes with a stand that will hold your completed puzzle up on a shelf or a desk. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">best puzzle gifts</a> currently available for Pokémon fans right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tips for Buying Pokémon Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has done quite a bit of puzzle research (and quite a bit of puzzling), I have a few suggestions to help you narrow down your search for the perfect fit. Here are a couple of key things to look out for when buying a Pokémon puzzle:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure it's a trusted brand</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing you'll want to do before you buy <em>any </em>jigsaw puzzle online is check what brand it's from. There are some puzzle brands that are more trusted than others, many of which I've featured on this list already. A good brand tends to have higher quality puzzles, which means higher quality materials. And for Pokémon puzzles specifically, they will likely be selling the puzzles in an official capacity via licensing the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When in doubt, I'd suggest reading through Amazon reviews to see what people thought. Things to watch out for are missing pieces, thin cardboard, and obvious AI usage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get the right piece count for the occasion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important thing to think about is who you're buying the puzzle for. If it's a gift for an experienced puzzler, 1,000 pieces and above is probably ideal. But if it's for a novice or a younger audience, then 500 or below is probably your best bet. Larger puzzles tend to take a <em>lot </em>longer and if you don't have a dedicated space set up for puzzling you'll likely never finish. This is where a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table</a> really comes in handy.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 3, 2025 2:30 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-puzzles]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Silent Hill fandom is seemingly split once again, this time over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s "soulslike" combat.</p>
<p>As more and more teasers and footage pop up online in the run-up to 25th September's launch day, fans are getting stuck into all the new gameplay. But while we already <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">knew</a> the combat would have a "heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>", fans are concerned about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">how enemies react</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mg6fn0/the_small_hypocrisy_im_seeing_for_silent_hill_f/">degradable weapons</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">"soulslike" boss encounters</a>.</p>
<p>"The game is looking incredible overall in terms of detail and quality. The amount of work the devs have put in is really impressive. That said, I’m a bit worried about how the combat is shaping up, specifically, how enemies react (or don’t react) when taking hits," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">said one player</a>.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't guy[s] please don't tell me it's true," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">lamented one fan</a>. "I love this series and I'm really hyped for the game, but please game devs, don't take this route, don't sacrifice what this series is know [sic] for to trend chase. Don't alienate your audience. I'm honestly scared if this is the direction there [sic] taking this series."</p>
<p>"The combat certainly concerns me. Even if it ends up being amazing, I feel apprehensive about a Silent Hill game having combat that evokes the counter timings of Sekiro," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf9o9e/comment/n6fl6ds/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> someone else. "Hopefully they pull a Bloober and prove me wrong. At the very least, I hope it’s a good horror game even if it ends up failing as a Silent Hill game."</p>
<p>To be fair, this isn't the first time the series has dabbled with degradable weapons – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> and Silent Hill Origins did, too, although how successful that was lies in the eye of the player, I guess. The problem for some, however, is how those degradable weapons could inhibit exploration.</p>
<p>"I'd like to scour the in-game world and pick up all the details/memos, but if I'm burning through my decent weapons at every stop to do so, I'm eventually gonna stop exploring to conserve resources," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf2maj/comment/n6ffoo9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested one fan</a>.</p>
<p>As for the other complaints? Well, there were plenty of those for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> in the run-up to release, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">turned out to be one of my favourite games in years</a> (and what I think is the only 5/5 I've awarded in all the years I've reviewed here). So the good news is, regardless of how the previews are making fans feel, September will be here before we know it.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>It's being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fandom-split-on-silent-hill-fs-soulslike-combat]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yes, hello folks, it's your regularly scheduled eShop Selects, this time for July 2025. As always, we're looking at the best of the rest — the best eShop exclusives you may have missed on Switch 1 and Switch 2. Yes, other games besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <em>did</em> come out, you know?</p>
<p>A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has kept the future looking bright for both consoles, so let's peel through the rules because we have a good one this month; our writers and contributors vote for their top three games from our pile of reviews of eShop exclusives that launched in July 2025. Those games are then scored (with 1 getting the highest score, 3 the lowest), then we tally the results up and the trio with the highest total make our top three.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vorygx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> is missing here, we know — review codes for the Switch release weren't available until launch day (the very last day of the month). So, we promise we're beavering away to get our impressions to you, but that's why you won't see it included below.</p>
<p>Overall, nine games made the cut for votes this month. Everything below scored at least a 7/10 or above, so here's what <em>just</em> missed out on the podium:</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">3rd Place - Time Flies</a></h2>
<p>Here's an odd gem we've had an eye on since a Day of the Devs stream a few years ago. Time Flies is a philosophical tale about a fly who only has a short amount of time to live. What can they do in that small slice of life they were handed from birth? Whatever they want.</p>
<p>Did you know flies can get drunk? Or make music? Or not be annoying? And look, we're not saying the timing of releasing after Mario Paint arrived on NSO (with that fly swatting game) was prophetic, but... okay, look, the art style is so similar.</p>
<p>Time Flies is short, sweet, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/time-flies">an excellent 8/10 pick-up</a> for the Switch.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:185093 @ 1754249190 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">2nd Place - Monument Valley 3</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Monument Valley</strong> series feels like a no-brainer for Switch, but amazingly, it took until this year to get <em>any</em> of the games on the hybrid series. Fortunately, the newest entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley III</a>, followed soon after. And it's just as excellent.</p>
<p>The lack of touch controls might be a dampener, but there's some incredibly thoughtful and clever puzzling to experience here. It's also beautiful to look at, with stunning uses of colour and perspective to make each puzzle shine. it might be the easiest of the trio, but it's still well worth a go.</p>
<p>Have a read of our review if you want to know more; it more than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/monument-valley-iii">earned its 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">1st Place - Patapon 1+2 Replay</a></h2>
<p>There was a clear winner for July, with the PSP's darling making a bold multiplatform comeback courtesy of Bandai Namco. That's right, it's all about 'pata-pata-pon-pon!' Congratulations to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, which got votes from all but one participant.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what Patapon is, you're basically an invisible entity commanding a group of strange creatures to the beat of their music. They'll react to your drum beats and run, guard, attack, and rush. Every single song is a complete earworm, and with all the helpful little features added into this version, both games have never played better.</p>
<p>We may have scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">a 7/10</a>, but it's still marched its way into our hearts.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-july-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While new viral hit Peak can often feel as challenging as it is fun to play, rumour has it that in the next day or so, the procedurally-generated map won't be tricky as much as it'll be unbeatable. Whoops.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media yesterday, developer Aggro Crab confessed that a modder on Discord had discovered an upcoming map will position a campfire – which players need to light in order to proceed to the next biome – on top of an "unreachable" tree.</p>

<p>"A modder in Discord has informed me that in two days there will be a map where the campfire spawns in an unreachable tree," the developer confessed. "Chat, do I go to the office on Saturday to fix this." The message was appended with a slew of crying emojis.</p> <div>

<p>Though Aggro Crab didn't specify what mod gave the player an early head's up, it's likely they're talking about the seed mod that lets people select a seed in config (in this case, it's <a href="https://x.com/digi_the_robot/status/1951899207390126389">reportedly</a> level_8).</p>
<p>The message spawned hundreds of replies, ranging from "<a href="https://x.com/Ringer_53/status/1951527964778074393">Nah, we'll live.

<p>"Just add a sign that says good luck lol," <a href="https://x.com/LucarnAnderson/status/1951633892513083696">wrote</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision was made to leave it be.</p>
<p>"I think with those you can make it [with a chain launcher or anti rope], so maybe fk it we ball," the developer eventually <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1951533385375162582">declared</a>.</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourself-peak-fans-aggro-crab-reckons-you-can-get-to-an-unreachable-campfire-thats-coming-up-soon]]></content:encoded>

<p>But before Gandalf comes a-knocking, let's take a look at what went down <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-blast-corps">last week</a>, when we matched up two different covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/blast_corps">Blast Corps</a>. In the battle of East and West, Japan came out on top, with the badass 'Blastdozer' cover taking 58% of the vote and leaving Europe and North America with the remaining 42%.</p>
<p>If you hadn't guessed it by now, we're taking a trip to Middle Earth this week (what can we say? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire</a> has put us in the mood for something... else) as we match up two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> on Game Boy Advance. Now, is it the best LOTR game out there? Not by a long shot, but it throws up two drastically different cover designs, so prepare for some whiplash.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0xwvhmz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hobbit - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11cbe1e5d1144/the-hobbit-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14213-the-hobbit-the-prelude-to-the-lord-of-the-rings">Sierra Entertainment / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might expect the design for a game of The Hobbit — a <em>children's</em> book, let's not forget — to be bright, colourful, and full of fun. Not in the West, it seems. The North American and European design is all about the gloom, with slightly uncanny Bilbo standing front and centre, and uncanny Gandalf and Smaug looming behind.</p>
<p>Despite the gloominess, we quite like the design on this one. It promises drama and adventure in a way that the game never really delivered on, but there's no denying that ol' Mr Baggins looks rather heroic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hobbit - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82f3b73c9548d/the-hobbit-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14213-the-hobbit-the-prelude-to-the-lord-of-the-rings">Sierra Entertainment / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, now <em>this</em> is something else entirely. The Japanese design goes ham with the bright colours, placing Bilbo, Gandalf and Smaug (now joined by Gollum) in broad daylight, with the Lonely Mountain and Mirkwood backdrop not looking quite so menacing. The One Ring also makes an appearance on this one, you know, if you were curious <em>which</em> Hobbit the game was about.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Koei Tecmo has released an anniversary trailer for the Dynasty Warriors franchise which is now 25 years old. In the trailer, there is a flythrough of clips from across the games from the very beginning to Origins and it shows the evolutions that the series has gone through while maintaining the core gameplay. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The Dynasty Warriors anniversary trailer ends with two bits of big news for the series. The first is Dynasty Warriors Origins will be getting a major DLC, but there are no details on what that will entail. The second piece of news is that a Dynasty Warriors game will be getting remastered, but Koei Tecmo has not confirmed which of the games will get that treatment.</p>

<p>In our Dynasty Warriors: Origins review, Jim said, <em>“As someone who has zealously played every entry in the series since its inception more than two decades ago, I’d say Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the best Musou game ever. After years of unsurprising reiteration and plenty of misfires, Omega Force has delivered a smart and super polished reinvention of the Musou franchise that corrects so many of its past shortcomings.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-shows-off-available-weapons-in-new-trailer.1260882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're now in August, the launch month for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-shown-new-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and the developers have now released a brand new trailer to show off all the available weapon options in the game.</p>



<p>The first one is of course the sword, which allows for fast, 'split-second strikes'. The greatsword, on the other hand, is slower but capable of 'earth-shattering power'. The third weapon is the poleblade, which is said to deliver a 'piercing storm' to enemies. The fourth and final option is the scythe, which enables 'cutting-edge control' of its strikes. The trailer also demonstrates how Lost Soul Aside allows seamless weapons swapping even mid-combo. Players can, for example, launch an enemy in the air with one weapon and then slam it back down with another. </p>



<p>The unique stats of each weapon can significantly influence the player's tactical approach. The weapons can also be enhanced and customized by using special weapon fragments discovered throughout Lost Soul Aside. These fragments can alter the weapons' appearance, enhance combat or healing capabilities, and upgrade Kaser's fighting style. Players can attach fragments to their weapons and experiment with unique combinations to discover thrilling and powerful effects.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Weapons Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAq-nuQeLdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Lost Soul Aside wears its inspiration (mainly games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta) on its sleeve, although technically it is described as having roleplaying elements, too. Indeed, protagonist Kaser will grow even stronger throughout the game by attaining new skills and abilities unlocked via a dedicated Skill Tree. These powerful skills, which can boost damage, enhance healing, and generate protective shields, are granted by the dragon-like creature Arena.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to further intensify attacks with precise, high-impact bursts of strength by timing button presses during weapon combos to achieve devastating results. Finally, the Fusion Gauge can be filled through attack combos and abilities to summon Arena’s claws and fiercely strike enemies. This upgradeable skill unlocks new combat techniques as Kaser progresses in his mission.</p>



<p>After over ten years of development, the game that started as a solo project by Yang Bing is scheduled to launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 29. You can find the PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> arrived on the Switch late last year and it's received some updates since then including a performance boost.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, the developer has announced it's released a new patch for the Switch version, which brings it up to date with the PC release. You can see these previous patch updates for PC <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1887400/allnews/">via the game's Steam Page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch patch is now LIVE! Thanks everyone for your patience. This update brings the Switch version up to date with the PC release. Enjoy!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't tried out Antonblast yet, there's a demo you can check out. The game is also currently on sale in select regions, and you can read our full review here on Nintendo Life for more information. We gave it eight out of ten stars, calling it a great tribute to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wario_land_shake_it">Wario Land</a> series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whether on Switch or elsewhere, we’d suggest you pick this one up if you’re at all a fan of Nintendo’s <em>other</em> Italian mascot and are looking for a well-made and fast-paced new 2D platformer"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-dm-release-date-in-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-gm-release-date-in-october.1260792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update:</strong> In addition to the news from the official press release more was available as part of the Critical Role Direct.</p>

<p>The first piece of confirmation is that while Matthew Mercer will be stepping back from the GM chair for Critical Role Campaign 4 he will still be at the table, getting to be a full time player. While no other players were explicitly confirmed for the Campaign 4 table Matt did state that he would be playing "alongside [his] favorite familiar faces and a number of newer ones that I cannot wait to reveal to you."</p>

<p>It was also <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/critical-role-brennan-lee-mulligan-campaign-4-1236477230/" rel="nofollow">revealed via a Variety interview</a> that Brennan Lee Mulligan also just struck a new three-year development deal with Dropout so don't expect him to be leaving Dimension20 and the dome anytime soon.</p>

<p>In his interview with Variety, Mulligan teases that there is an announcement of what game system will be in use "scheduled and on route" but stayed tight-lipped on anything further.</p>


<hr><p>The Critical Role Direct has now released, and with it the confirmation of a release date for Critical Role Campaign 4, but also the confirmation about some details of who will be the GM for this game, and where it will take place… or at least where it WON'T take place.</p>



<p>Fans of Critical Role will be able to tune in and watch the first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4 when it returns to Thursday nights on October 2nd, 2025. At the time of posting, we're exactly two months away from this premiere.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt.jpg?itok=95B80vCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt.jpg?itok=D5lS-6k5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The much more unexpected news of this reveal is that <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matthew Mercer</a>, Dungeon Master for the previous three campaigns and CCO of Critical Role Productions, will not be the Game Master for Critical Role campaign 4. Instead, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan will be taking up the role of Game Master</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve been enormous fans of Brennan’s for many years now, and when it came to giving both Matthew Mercer and the world of Exandria a bit of a breather, Brennan felt like the perfect storyteller to take our community somewhere entirely new.” - Travis Willingham, CEO, co-founder, and cast member of Critical Role</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement from Willingham also reveals that Campaign 4 will not take place in Exandria, the world of Mercer's creation that has been the home for each main Campaign and various spin-offs like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dc0a217-e28f-4919-887d-2ef0511e836a" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton" rel="nofollow">EXU: Downfall</a>. This is further backed up by Marisha Ray, Creative Director and Co-Founder of Critical Role, stating, "Everything about Campaign 4 is fresh; new world, new tone, new possibilities. We can’t wait for the fans to experience what we’ve been building.”</p>

<p>Brennan Lee Mulligan is in no way a stranger to the Critical Role table, being not only a player but also the Dungeon Master in a number of spin-off settings. Mulligan had the following to say on the announcement and his taking on the GM role for Critical Role Campaign 4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What a gift, a privilege and an honor to be invited behind the screen of Critical Role for this next epic adventure. Every collaboration we have had together has brought nothing but sheer joy, and Campaign 4 will be no exception. I'm finally playing *almost* as much tabletop as I'd like to!"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Will Critical Role Campaign 4 be <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> or <em>Daggerheart</em>?</h2>

<p>While this announcement answered a few questions that fans had been clamouring to find out about the future of Critical Role, it does certainly leave a number still unanswered.</p>

<p>Who will be playing in Campaign 4? Will Matt have a chance to play at the table or focus on continued world-building? Is Robbie Daymond going to be back at the table? Will Campaign 4 be as long as a standard multi-year Campaign of Critical Role?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-age-of-umbra.jpg?itok=gw7DfDfW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-age-of-umbra.jpg?itok=Tu9e6n2N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps the biggest question left unanswered is whether Critical Role Campaign 4 will use <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> as the previous campaigns have, or if they'll move on to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="951117a2-07e4-403b-b1c3-26041d599e45" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, Critical Role and Darrington Press' newly released TTRPG. It is curious that the press release and announcement only use generic terms such as 'Game Master' and 'TTRPGs'.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/gencon2025-announcements/" rel="nofollow">announcement of a second season of Age of Umbra</a>, a <em>Daggerheart </em>campaign in a Grimdark setting that Mercer designed, it may be that Mercer is continuing to work on <em>Daggerheart </em>adventures while Mulligan spins stories in a world built for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>TechRaptor reached out to Critical Role for any potential answers but were advised that at this time the Campaign 4 release date and that Brennan Lee Mulligan would be helming the table were all they were ready to talk about. There are two months to go until the release of Critical Role Campaign 4 so be on the lookout for announcements related to the setting, cast, and more.</p>

        <p>A BioShock 1 remake has also reportedly been cancelled.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cloud Chamber, the studio tasked with reviving the decade-dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> series, has reportedly failed an internal review with 2K Games execs, resulting in a leadership shakeup.</p>
<p>Anonymous sources speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> said it was the game's narrative, in particular, that apparently failed to impress, and was "identified as an area in need of improvement [that] will be revamped in the coming months".</p>

<p>Following the review, studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted, and creative director Hogarth de la Plante moved into "a publishing role". The rest of the Cloud Chamber team was told in an all-hands meeting that the company needed "to become more agile and efficient". Colleagues are now worried that cuts may follow.</p>
<p>In response to the report, a 2K spokesperson acknowledged the change at the top of the studio to Bloomberg, saying it remained "fully committed to ensuring we deliver a BioShock game that exceeds the lofty expectations of our fans".</p>
<p>"We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future," 2K Games said in a statement. "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path."</p>
<p>Sadly, there's even more bad news for BioShock fans. Right at the end of the report, Bloomberg confirmed both the existence - and the cancellation - of a remake of the first BioShock game. It's unclear why the project was cancelled, but sources say it was shelved earlier in the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">Netflix's BioShock adaptation was similarly "reconfigured" last year</a> to be a "more personal" film with a tighter budget. Producer Roy Lee told fans at a panel at last year's San Diego Comic-Con that changes at the top of Netflix's movie department have seen the budget streamlined, so "we're doing a much smaller version... It's going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive]]></content:encoded>
