              <p>Your current graphics card struggles to maintain 60fps on modern AAA games and forces you to lower settings until everything looks like a PlayStation 3 title from 2008. The good news is that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5293/">Asus GeForce RTX 5070 just dropped to $584 from $739 on Amazon, offering 12GB of GDDR7 memory and Nvidia’s latest architecture for the lowest price this card has ever seen</a>. That’s flagship gaming performance before the holiday rush clears inventory, and gives you the horsepower to max out Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5293/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Raw Power That Delivers 4K Gaming</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 has 12GB of GDDR7 memory running on a 192-bit bus which delivers <strong>huge bandwidth for textures, shadows and ray-traced reflections</strong> that the older cards choke on. Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture brings third-generation RT cores and ups performance for ray tracing three times over previous generations, and allows you to actually enable those gorgeous lighting effects without watching your framerate collapse.</p>



<p>The 5888 CUDA cores tear through modern game engines, pushing consistent 60+ fps at 4K resolution in demanding titles like Alan Wake 2, Starfield, and the latest Call of Duty. <strong>DLSS 3.5 with Frame Generation uses AI</strong> to create additional frames and doubles your framerate in supported games and achieves buttery-smooth 120fps gaming in graphically intense scenarios.</p>
<p>The Asus TUF design wraps this <strong>GPU in military-grade components and a protective PCB coating against dust, moisture, and static discharge</strong>. That matters with rigs that run hot during marathon gaming sessions or live in less-than-pristine environments. The triple Axial-tech fans feature a unique barrier ring design that increases air pressure by 31% compared to standard fans and pushes more cool air through the heatsink to keep temperatures under control during extended gaming.</p>



<p>PCIe 5.0 future-proofs your system for future motherboards and processors but the card works just fine in the PCIe 4.0 slots that most current systems are using. You get <strong>two HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 outputs</strong> to support multiple 4K displays at 120Hz or one 8K monitor, depending on what you’re trying to do with multi-monitor setups or cutting-edge high-refresh displays.</p>
<p>This deal makes the RTX 5070 cheaper than many RTX 4070 Ti models at $584, with superior performance and newer technology. This is the lowest price ever, so if you’re still waiting for an excuse to upgrade from a struggling GTX or older RTX card, there’s no reason to keep suffering through low settings and choppy framerates anymore.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-dumps-its-14-inch-vivobook-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-most-budget-laptops-2000640675</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-dumps-its-14-inch-vivobook-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-most-budget-laptops.1341838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asus hardly ever runs sales on its laptops, let alone its best-sellers like those in the Vivobook series. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5292/">14-inch Vivobook is now available from Amazon for $476, down from $799</a>, and it’s an all-time low price cut for a configuration that<strong> packs 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and Intel’s 10-core i5-1334U processor</strong>. That’s a straight 40% discount that pushes the price of a premium ultraportable below most budget laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5292/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3>Great Laptop in 2025</h3>
<p>Inside this Vivobook sits an Intel Core i5-1334U processor with a total of 10 cores divided between performance and efficiency architectures which boosts to 4.6GHz when you need maximum speed for more demanding tasks. This multi-core design crushes workloads that include Excel data analysis, Photoshop editing and light gaming without the stuttering usually experienced with dual-core budget laptops.</p>



<p>Heavy lifting-like compiling code or exporting videos-is left to the performance cores, while efficiency cores manage background processes and lighter tasks to conserve battery. The 24GB of DDR4 RAM means even the most strenuous multitasking-scenario virtual machines, 4K footage editing, and 50-plus browser tabs open across multiple research projects-run smoothly.</p>
<p>For this price, <strong>you get a 1TB PCIe SSD with read speeds over 3,000 MB/s</strong>. It means Windows will boot in less than 10 seconds, applications launch instantly, and you are never left waiting. With its huge storage capacity, you can hold years of documents, photos, videos, and software without being pushed onto cloud subscriptions or external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>14-inch FHD display pushes sharp text and vibrant colors</strong> through an IPS panel with ultra-narrow bezels that maximize screen real estate. A 16:9 aspect ratio provides enough vertical space for productivity work like writing and coding without losing the widescreen format so great for streaming shows and movies. Anti-glare coating on the display reduces eye strain in marathon study sessions or all-day work sprints.</p>
<p>From a security point of view, <strong>the HD webcam includes a physical privacy shutter</strong>, which, when slid into place, physically covers the lens, offering the best and fullest assurance that no defective software or malware could turn on the camera without your knowledge. The video call quality remains clear and sharp for seamless Zoom meetings, online classes and remote collaboration.</p>



<p>The<strong> battery life extends up to 8 hours for typical use</strong>, and covers most workdays or class schedules without hunting for outlets in between.<strong> Windows 11 is pre-installed with integrated Microsoft Copilot AI</strong> to help with drafting emails, summarizing documents, creating creative content, and automating repetitive tasks using natural language-based commands. Wireless connectivity is taken care of by Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1 to support modern peripherals, hotspots, and home networks. The <strong>port selection includes USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack</strong>.</p>
<p>At $476 instead of $799, this deal is the lowest price Amazon has offered on an Asus Vivobook with this configuration. Budget laptops at similar prices ship with half the RAM, a quarter of the storage and processors that struggle with anything beyond web browsing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-1tb-hp-laptop-at-70-off-is-practically-free-amazon-adds-299-bonus-bundle-on-top-2000640664</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-1tb-hp-laptop-at-70-off-is-practically-free-amazon-adds-299-bonus-bundle-on-top.1341814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A $2,000 laptop typically means you’re buying a MacBook Pro or high-end Windows machine with premium specs that justify the investment. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">HP 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop originally carried that same $1,999 price tag but just crashed to $626 on Amazon</a>, and drops into mid-range laptop territory while packing specs that embarrass most competitors at double the cost.</p>
<p>The 69% discount makes this <strong>one of the best HP laptop deals of the year</strong>, delivering <strong>32GB of RAM, a full 1TB SSD, and an Intel Core i3 1315U processor</strong> that handles work and study without breaking a sweat. Amazon sweetens the deal further by<strong> throwing in an exclusive accessory kit worth $299</strong> including a mouse, laptop sleeve and other essentials you’d normally buy separately.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic Specs for Everyday</h2>
<p>Inside, this laptop has an Intel Core i3 1315U processor <strong>with six cores that boost up to 4.5GHz</strong> and give you enough horsepower for video calls, document editing, web browsing with dozens of tabs and light content creation. The 10th generation architecture of the processor balances performance cores for demanding tasks with efficiency cores for background processes so that your battery lasts longer during all-day classes or work sessions.</p>
<p>Again, 32GB of DDR4 RAM ensures that multitasking is smooth even when running virtual meetings on Zoom, editing spreadsheets and keeping research tabs open all at once. Most laptops at this price point ship with 8GB of RAM that chokes under moderate workloads which makes this configuration a huge upgrade for professionals who need real multitasking capability.</p>
<p>With the 1TB SSD, you get years of document and media file storage without being forced into cloud storage subscriptions or external drives. Employing SSD technology, near-instant boot times and application launches eliminate waiting that turns productivity into procrastination. The read and write speeds of this drive make file transfers and software installations dramatically faster compared to conventional hard drives.</p>



<p>The intuitive touch further extends to an interactive <strong>15.6-inch HD touchscreen that changes how you will be working</strong> with spreadsheets and creative applications. Touch gestures-such as pinch-to-zoom, swipe navigation, and tap selection-are natural to anyone who uses a smartphone daily, which makes it easier on the learning curve for new users. The HD resolution of 1366×768 balances clarity with battery efficiency: it’s sharp enough for everyday tasks without the power-hungry requirement of 4K displays.</p>
<p>Advanced features such as BitLocker for encrypting sensitive files and Hyper-V to run virtual machines <strong>come pre-installed in Windows 11 Pro</strong>. A dedicated Copilot AI key launches Microsoft’s AI assistant in an instant to help users with everything from drafting emails and summarizing documents to generating images to automating repetitive tasks without needing to open individual apps. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity provides faster downloads, smoother streaming and more reliable connections within crowded networks.</p>



<p>The connectivity suite rounds out with two USB-A 3.0 ports for legacy devices, a single USB-C 3.0 port for modern peripherals and fast data transfer, and an HDMI port for easy connecting of external monitors or projectors during presentations.</p>
<p>At $626 instead of $1,999, this deal represents the steepest discount Amazon has offered on a fully-equipped HP laptop with these specifications. The included $299 accessory kit saves you from having to hunt for compatible mice, sleeves, and cables once your laptop arrives.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-drops-to-record-low-amazon-practically-giving-it-away-for-pennies-2000640660</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-v11-drops-to-record-low-amazon-practically-giving-it-away-for-pennies.1341802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mid-range vacuum cleaners sell for around $400 and deliver middling performance that leaves you vacuuming the same spot three times. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Dyson V11 cordless stick vacuum drops to $399 from $629 on Amazon</a> and puts great Dyson engineering at the exact price point where most people settle for inferior suction and frustrating battery life. This <strong>all-time low means you’re paying mid-range money for a flagship vacuum</strong> that actually picks up everything in one pass instead of pushing debris around like a broom with commitment issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Suction Power That Works on Real Dirt</h2>
<p>The Dyson V11 generates <strong>185 Air Watts of suction through its Dyson Hyperdymium motor</strong> which spins at 125,000 rpm to create cyclonic forces that capture 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns. That microscopic filtration traps allergens, dust mites and pet dander instead of blowing them back into your air like cheap vacuums with inadequate sealing.</p>



<p>The fully sealed filtration system ensures what gets sucked in stays trapped in the bin rather than escaping through gaps and vents. <strong>Three cleaning modes adjust power output based on floor type</strong>: Eco mode conserves battery for light cleaning, Auto mode intelligently adapts suction to different surfaces, and Boost mode delivers maximum power for ground-in dirt and stubborn pet hair.</p>
<p>The torque drive cleaner head features stiff nylon bristles that dig into carpet fibers to extract embedded debris while anti-static carbon fiber filaments capture fine dust from hard floors without scratching. Dynamic Load Sensor technology automatically detects floor type and adjusts suction power in real time, so you’re never wasting battery on bare floors or leaving dirt in carpets.</p>



<p><strong>Battery runtime reaches up to 60 minutes in Eco mode</strong> with non-motorized tools and covers most homes in a single charge without the anxiety of dying mid-clean. The seven-cell lithium-ion battery delivers fade-free power that maintains consistent suction from full charge until the last minute, eliminating the frustrating power drop that plagues cheaper cordless models. The LCD screen displays remaining runtime in real time based on your current power mode and attachment, so you know exactly how much cleaning time remains.</p>
<p>The point-and-shoot bin emptying mechanism ejects dirt with a single push and keeps your hands away from dust and allergens. The 0.2-gallon bin capacity handles typical cleaning sessions without constant trips to the trash can, though homes with multiple shedding pets may need more frequent emptying. The hair screw tool features a conical brush bar that spirals hair off and into the bin instead of tangling around bristles like traditional attachments.</p>



<p>The vacuum <strong>converts from stick to handheld configuration in seconds</strong> by removing the wand, transforming it into a powerful tool for stairs, upholstery and car interiors. <strong>Six included attachments</strong> cover every cleaning scenario: the combination tool for quick dusting, crevice tool for tight gaps, mini motorized tool for upholstery, soft dusting brush for delicate surfaces, stubborn dirt brush for dried-on messes, and up-top adapter for high-reach cleaning. Wall-mounted docking station charges the vacuum and stores all attachments in one organized location, eliminating the tangle of tools stuffed in closets.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $629, this deal delivers Dyson’s flagship cordless performance at the price point where competitors offer vacuums that struggle with basic cleaning tasks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Contraband Screenshots Emerge After Game’s Cancelation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/contraband-screenshots-emerge-after-game%E2%80%99s-cancelation.1341799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Screenshots of the canceled Xbox exclusive Contraband have surfaced online. With the new look, we see what the multiplayer game could’ve looked like had it come out. </p>



<p>The game, created by Just Cause’s Avalanche Studios, was revealed in 2021 with a neat trailer. We never saw gameplay, as it was just a teaser, but it seems the game was doing fine <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/job-listing-shows-contraband-is-still-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind the scenes</a>. However, infrequent updates and notable absences from presentations hinted that development may not have been going well. In August, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active development had stopped</a> to evaluate the game’s future. Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many were laid off</a> due to the move, seemingly ending the game for good. Now, we have a clue as to what it would’ve looked like.</p>



<h2 id="h-contraband-would-ve-had-four-player-multiplayer-and-stylized-graphics-screenshots-reveal">Contraband Would’ve Had Four-Player Multiplayer and Stylized Graphics, Screenshots Reveal</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Contraband - Official Reveal Trailer 4K | E3 2021" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5qlGpqHggw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>A portfolio of one of Contraband’s UI artists was found online. In it, new screenshots of the canceled game’s UI and design are shown. Furthermore, we see the vision that Avalanche was going for with the design. <br></p>



<p>The pictures, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, show off a retro-like art style for the character models and typeface, reminiscent of the late 1900s. We also see how the game would’ve been done, with players joining sessions and teaming up in groups of four to tackle maps. One of the maps, Downtown, is seen in one of the photos and may show what it would’ve looked like in-game.<a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a>It’s important to note that, even if true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;As mentioned before, no gameplay has been released, so this may be the best we’ll have for a while. Still, it’s cool to see what could’ve been for the multiplayer game. It hasn’t been outright canceled, though it likely has given the lack of updates, so perhaps things could work out.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-creator-pondsmith-keanu-reeves-2077-sequel/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-creator-on-keanu-reeves-in-2077-sequel-%E2%80%9Ccontact-me%E2%80%9D.1341775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of Cyberpunk wants Keanu Reeves back for Cyberpunk 2077’s upcoming sequel, despite how the story goes. Furthermore, he said he ‘has ways of bringing him back’.</p>



<p>Released in 1998, the Cyberpunk tabletop game, created by Mike Pondsmith, has been a staple of TTRPG fans for decades. In 2020, CD Projekt Red, known for The Witcher series, brought the edgy techno-dystopian world to gaming. While mixed at launch, subsequent updates, and a brilliant anime adaptation (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-another-new-netflix-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>) made the game a must-play. If you were around during the late 2010s, you know how huge the hype was, especially when Hollywood icon Keanu Reeves was announced as Johnny Silverhand. His portrayal of the rebel rockstar was a highlight for many, given how much time the player spends with him. Unfortunately, the endings don’t leave much room for the rocker to continue. However, it seems the creator may have a way to bring him back.</p>



<h2 id="h-mike-pondsmith-wants-keanu-reeves-back-for-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">Mike Pondsmith Wants Keanu Reeves Back for Cyberpunk 2077 Sequel</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REDstreams special — Interview with Mike Pondsmith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_HsIlaqMkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a livestream from CD Projekt Red, Mike Pondsmith, the TTRPG creator, joined the crew to discuss Cyberpunk 2077. When talking about Keanu Reeves’ portrayal as Johnny Silverhand (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=07ai4guwLhOQuEPL&amp;t=3619">at around the hour mark</a>), he said,</p>



<p>“<strong>Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again</strong>,” Pondsmith states. “<strong>I have ways to do that, Keanu, contact me.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given the DLC was able to get Idris Elba and it’s worldwide success, it’s not suprising that the John Wick star would want to return. If Mike Pondsmith wants him back and can make it happen, then we may have it happen. All we know about Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel is that it’s in development, but no set release window. CD Projekt Red is currently working on The Witcher 4, but, for Cyberpunk fans, Cyberpunk Edgerunners 2 is in production, so it won’t be long before we return to Night City.</p>



<p>Do you want Johnny Silverhand to return for Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel? How do you think he’ll come back? Did you enjoy Cyberpunk 2077? Phantom Liberty?

<p>Use these Brainrot Tsunami monthly redeem codes for October 2025 to get free rewards in the game, including in-game currencies as well as potions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brainrot Tsunami is often described as a weird <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-raise-animals-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulator game where players must navigate tsunami waves and run through the map. Starting with a low speed, players are tasked with training to improve their pace, thereby making the process of dodging the tsunami waves that much easier. Another key mechanic in the game requires players to train with Brainrots. The game also allows players to spawn special tsunami waves, which can be used to troll the competition. As simple as the gameplay sounds, there is a decent amount of strategy involved, and with that in mind, any way to get ahead of the other players must be considered. That’s exactly where these codes will come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-brainrot-tsunami-codes">Expired Brainrot Tsunami Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Brainrot Tsunami. However, as soon as one of the active codes expires, we will immediately update this page to indicate that. Players are hence urged to redeem the active codes as soon as possible, as there is no fixed timeline for their validity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike many Roblox games today, redeeming codes in Brainrot Tsunami is a fairly straightforward process. The developers haven’t imposed any prerequisite steps on the players, in that all they have to redeem the codes is navigate through the menus and input one of the active codes given above into the correct text box. For players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem though, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide on how to redeem codes in this game:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Brainrot Tsunami.</li>



<li>Click on the shop button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ tab.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box that pops up.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Verify’ button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

<p>Brainrot Tsunami recently had an update, but unfortunately for players, they didn’t release any new codes. However, fans of the game mustn’t lose hope, as the developers are still working on the game, which means that new codes are likely on the horizon. New codes are often released through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ycveZcDGFV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> or through the Roblox game page. However, to make staying up to date with the codes easier, we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so check in every once in a while to maximise the number of rewards you can get.</p>

            <p>The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski says he has an "excellent" deal with developer CD Projekt Red, but admits it's "rare" that the studio gets in touch to ask for additional details these days.</p>
<p>Addressing fans at a book event to promote his Witcher prequel book, Crossroads of Ravens (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-author-has-an-excellent-deal-with-the-witcher-4-devs-but-its-rare-for-cd-projekt-to-ask-him-for-advice-anymore/">GamesRadar+</a>), Sapkowski revealed that while he had worked more closely with CDPR on prior games, he had not been approached to contribute to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, but insisted "the contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now".</p>
<p>"Let's hope it stays that way," he added.</p>

<p>Back in 2017, Sapkowski told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meeting-andrzej-sapkowski-the-writer-who-created-the-witcher">Eurogamer</a> the global success of The Witcher following the release of the third game in the series hadn't made him any money because he sold the rights to CD Projekt for a lump sum without asking for royalties, prompting a new deal in 2019.</p><p>"I was stupid enough to sell them rights to the whole bunch,"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-and-the-witcher-author-andrzej-sapkowski-ink-new-ip-rights-deal"> Sapkowski told Eurogamer at the time</a>. "They offered me a percentage of their profits. I said, 'No, there will be no profit at all - give me all my money right now! The whole amount.' It was stupid. I was stupid enough to leave everything in their hands because I didn't believe in their success. But who could foresee their success? I couldn't."</p>
<p>As for more recent The Witcher news? Last month, Sapkowski discussed a key plot point in the video game series that was actually a mistake in his novels, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-author-says-key-plot-point-from-the-games-is-based-on-a-mistake-but-video-game-people-have-clung-to-the-idea-with-remarkable-tenacity">"video game people have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity"</a>.</p>
<p>"The issue of 'witcher schools' requires - I apologise - a longer explanation," Sapkowski told a questioner in an AMA. "A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never.</p>
<p>"However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools'. Completely unnecessary."</p>

<p><em>Today, Jim and Alana are heading off to Kalos for Lumiose City Fashion Week...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>What's the best part about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>? The battle system? The catching? The Wild Zones? The Z-A Royale? No. All of those are factually incorrect answers. The best thing about Pokémon Legends: Z-A is buying clothes. Lots and lots of clothes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59rowujk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>I'll hear no other opinions on the matter. Z-A is far from the character customisation of a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate</a> or a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout</a>, but who needs 14 types of nose, forehead shapes, and muscle builds when you could have berets, wide-leg pants, and a frilly little satchel?</p>
<p>I've put more time into my outfit choices than I care to admit, and I know for a fact that fellow fashionista Alana has done the same. So join us as we celebrate Lumiose Fashion Week (an event we made up to distract from the Poké Dollars we've spent on shoes) by styling out some of our favourite fits.</p>
<h2>The 'Official' Lumiose City Fashion Show</h2>
<figure data-uuid="de097e1fa51c5"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de097e1fa51c5/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-woman-taking-photo-of-a-woman-in-silver-dress-7778884/">Nintendo Life / Ron Lach / Pexels</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, it's not 'official', nor is it a 'fashion show', but we've each been rifling through our virtual wardrobes to pick out the very best 'fits we can muster.</p>
<p>And of course we've based our looks on our beloved teams — what do you think we are? Rookies?</p>
<h3>Norman's Lumiose looks</h3>
<p>I never normally make myself in a Pokémon game. I almost always pick a different gender and name from my own and see the game through a <em>character's</em> eyes instead.</p>
<p>The exception is when the Pokémon game in question offers a bunch of outfits that I'd very much like to add to my real-life wardrobe. Then, Trainer Jim needs to have a shaggy bob, he needs to wear glasses, and he needs to slay every. single. look.</p>
<p>And so we arrive at my Lumiose collection. Not so much an attempt to directly imitate my Pokémon as it is to match their vibes. If those static NPCs could turn their heads when I walk down the street in my little Gengar number, they would. If they could move their eyes, I'd catch them with my vibrant Feraligatr get-up.</p>
<p>It's new. It's fresh. It's <a href="https://youtu.be/mIydlgER51o?si=RsIJD2nH-Bf1tbfA&amp;t=53">fashion</a>.</p>
<h4>Feraligatr Fit</h4>
<figure data-uuid="f57dc514a4f5d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f57dc514a4f5d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My beloved, vibrant boi needed a big, bold fit to match. Once you see that cream stripe as a little exposed belly sticking out from under a crop top, there's no going back. As for the trousers, well, they're the best money can buy in Lumiose and I won't hear otherwise.</p>
<h4>Absol-utely Fabulous</h4>
<figure data-uuid="6507534c4b6ef"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6507534c4b6ef/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Absol is high-end and edgy, so my fit is too. A white leather jacket and turtleneck are a bold pairing with some chino shorts, but those space boots tie everything together.</p>
<h4>Venusaur 'Venturing</h4>
<figure data-uuid="db4a98a33cff7"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db4a98a33cff7/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What is Venusaur if not a streetwear hiker's dream? The cargos, thicc trainers, and cap are all about presenting a hip exterior, while the fluffy jumper ups the cuddle-factor.</p>
<h4>Gengar Get-Up</h4>
<figure data-uuid="df0d3a87bfd9d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df0d3a87bfd9d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted the Gengar fit to feel like it was floating, hence the vaguely camo bottoms and floral boots. It's a blessing that I don't own one of these beanies in real life. You'd never see me without it.</p>
<h4>Cosy Camerupt</h4>
<figure data-uuid="7d6eee166ee96"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d6eee166ee96/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sure, Camerupt might have a tough exterior (just look at that scowl!), but there's something about him that just feels cosy — hence the comfy cardigan and wide-leg jeans. I'm colour matching a little, but this one's all about the vibes.</p>
<h4>Ooh La La, Gardevoir</h4>
<figure data-uuid="978af0e90dfb1"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/978af0e90dfb1/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Call off the stylists, I've found my favourite fit! The whites are classy, chic, and clean. There's a subtle floral undertone in the loafers, on my beret and in the earrings. Don't even get me started on that hip pop!</p>
<p>If you see this pair heading for you in the mall, you'd better know your azures from your ceruleans.</p>
<h3>Hagues' Kalos kit</h3>
<p>Okay, first off, let's address the Copperajah in the room — I do not have long blue hair in real life. But this trainer also isn't me. This is Kisa, an avatar character I've been using for quite a while. She's my Warrior of Light in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and, as a result, I've grown quite attached to her and sometimes let her jump ship into other games.</p>
<p>Anyone who's played FFXIV knows that 'glamour is the true end-game', so you <em>know</em> we've got some fashion chops here.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm usually a <em>little</em> more girly with my looks, but my team is a mix of ethereal, dopey, and cool. How do you make that work? Well...</p>
<h4>Florges' Fall Florals</h4>
<figure data-uuid="dcc14a95a5e2d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcc14a95a5e2d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>I know</em> I went florals for Florges... but only a little. I can't not. (I'm sorry, Miranda.)</p>
<p>But I didn't go <em>full</em> floral, I went Fall floral. I knew I had to fit the grey morning of Lumiose a little, so a cute little sweater and some sneakers rounded things out.</p>
<h4>Eclectic Eelektross</h4>
<figure data-uuid="eab7bcf9105b2"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eab7bcf9105b2/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the more difficult looks to assemble, Eelektross' colour scheme is gorgeous, but there aren't many easy matches here. The headphones were a must, as was yellow, but I can't match Canari's drip that well.</p>
<h4>Trendy Tyrantrum</h4>
<figure data-uuid="8fea7c3bed3d1"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8fea7c3bed3d1/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chic fossil hunter was my goal here, but Tyrantrum isn't exactly going to pair with an art deco jumpsuit. A boilersuit with a headband, though? Now that's a little bit cute.</p>
<h4>Hawlucha's a Hipster</h4>
<figure data-uuid="2a70dc4907199"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a70dc4907199/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am not a sportswear person, so I was most worried about pairing Kisa up with Hawlucha. Luckily, bright colours are kinda a lucha libre thing, therefore a Hawlucha thing. I can do brights; <em>that's</em> my thing.</p>
<h4>Chandelure Chic</h4>
<figure data-uuid="e6b4b7d49d1ba"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6b4b7d49d1ba/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ghost Pokémon are a gift for fashion, but there are so many obvious routes you could go down. Ultimately, Chandelure screams class to me, so an expensive suit and the hotel interior mean this was the easiest outfit to put together. Just save those Poké Dollars...</p>
<h4>Feraligatr feels Mega Fetching</h4>
<figure data-uuid="91a19b699ec30"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91a19b699ec30/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Totodile line has never been fierce to me — it's always been a goofy line that <em>tries</em> to be fierce. And I love that the Mega evolution for Feraligatr leans into that.</p>
<p>I adore Jim's vibrant red and blue look, but I went a little more classic sailor. Very French.</p>

Oh yes, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>. And we've got some fireworks in here.</p>
<p>Spooky season has passed and many of us are now looking ahead to the 'H' season (or perhaps there's some Turkey in the near future for you for those of you in the US). So it's time to load up on the best games you can get on the eShop for the chilly months ahead.</p>
<p>Just in case you need reminding, here are the rules: Our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from last month (that's October 2025) from our suite of reviews. The three games with the highest scores will make the podium. It's that simple!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nlrwpm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>It's been a crazy busy month what with Pokémon and tons of Switch 2 ports and indie releases, though that feels like every month at the moment, doesn't it? Every eShop game we scored a 7/10 or above is eligible here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a big one missing — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</a>. We're working on our full review and it'll be with you soon, but until then, make sure you check out <a href="https://youtu.be/zik-Cx7oxQE?si=70EZwzHIvWj1mkfB">Felix's video on the Switch 2 release</a>.</p>
<p>Alrighty then, here are all the games that didn't <em>quite</em> make the cut for the top three; plenty of fantastic games, but the cream of the crop was <em>very</em> good this time around:</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">3rd Place - Absolum (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>When Dotemu speaks, we listen. And we've been particularly excited about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, a brand new IP from the French studio that made its name on Streets of Rage 4 and Windjammers 2. Developed alongside Guard Crush Games and Supamonks, this is a roguelike beat 'em up with tons of style and customisation.</p>
<p>Besides looking <em>beautiful</em>, Absolum is all about finding the build that fits your play and combo style. You can play as one of four characters either alone or in two-player co-op and go through run after run as you try to save the world.</p>
<p>It's fiendishly good, and on Switch 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/absolum">we scored it a 9/10</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:188446 @ 1762134642 -->
<p><em>Note: Absolum did receive a physical launch just a few weeks after its release, but we've allowed it to remain part of the votes this month.</em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">2nd Place - Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>It may not be Metroid Prime Pinball, but hey, we don't <em>need</em> Samus when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a> is loaded up. A bullet hell pinball follow up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon's Tilt</a>? Cyberpunk imagery, a huge table, 9 balls? You'll never need another pinball table again.</p>
<p>You have a three-story pinball table to conquer, and it'll take you a good while to get your head around everything you can do in-game. But that Genesis-style soundtrack and those neon visuals will be more than enough to tempt you back for one more go.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action">another 9/10 for us</a> on the Switch 1. Heck of a game, that.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:192469 @ 1762134088 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Ball x Pit  (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a> is impossible to get away from right now. If you're a fan of roguelikes, Breakout, or Vampire Survivors, then you've probably already poured hours into this thing. It's <em>the</em> hot thing this October, and it's no surprise it won our staff's eShop Selects vote.</p>
<p>This mishmash of things, which includes base-building, multiple playable characters, tons of ball combinations (no giggling in the back, there), and waves and waves of enemies to stop you on each of your runs, is a cacophony of numbers, colours, and euphoria. Once you nail the formula with one character, you'll want to do it with them all. Keep aiming, bouncing, and combining, and you'll get there soon enough.</p>
<p>Rounding out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ball-x-pit">9/10s this month</a>, congrats to Ball x Pit for completely surprising us and taking away all of our free time! Oh! And a Switch 2 version dropped just last week, so go try it for yourself.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-october-2025]]></content:encoded>

Is the Animalese-to-English translator up and running? It is? Good. Welcome back to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Last time</a>, we put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> under the microscope, and it was a pretty close-run contest. The North American / European design <em>just</em> clinched the win, in the end, with 58% of the vote, leaving the Japanese variant with 42%.</p>
<p>We've got Animal Crossing on the mind this week (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">why on Earth could that be?</a>), so we're matching up two covers from the wonderful DS entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/animal_crossing_wild_world">Wild World</a>. Looking back on it today, Wild World is a somewhat slight experience when compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">New Horizons</a>, but back in the mid-2000s, it was a beauty. It was Animal Crossing <em>on the go</em>! What a concept!</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fisqwhr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>There are just two designs to check out this week, so let's get to it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:100046,193209 @ 1762134075 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26c0bab9dd418"><a title="Animal Crossing: Wild World - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26c0bab9dd418/animal-crossing-wild-world-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6281-animal-crossing-wild-world">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're all familiar with this one, right? The Western design is, well, it's a world. What's more, it's adorable. Just look at those polygonal little guys going about their lives! It crams in a good amount of series iconography, too, with plenty of familiar faces, stores and floating packages. It's just a very pleasing cover to look at.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e5dc7f0d8011e"><a title="Animal Crossing: Wild World - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5dc7f0d8011e/animal-crossing-wild-world-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6281-animal-crossing-wild-world">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design is similar, but different. Rather than present the world as a cohesive whole, this cover bisects it, pushing the characters from the Western box art to the top and bottom. All of the characters are still present and correct, but a few crop up in different positions to account for the division — get off the roof, Celeste!</p>
<p>It all leaves more room for the central logo, it's true, but we miss the sense of unity brought by seeing the world as a whole. Maybe that's just us, though.</p>
