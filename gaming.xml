            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, skateboarding has always been about getting into a flow state. Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut. So the greatest compliment I can give to <em>Skate City: New York</em> is that I’ve spent the past week fine-tuning the perfect playlist, all so that I can also perfect my runs in the game.</p><p><em>New York </em>is a sequel to the original <em>Skate City</em>; both are available through Apple Arcade, though the first game was eventually ported to consoles as well. It comes from Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto </em>series, and the shift to New York is a lot like the move from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064545/altos-adventure-iphone-ipad-snowboarding-game"><em>Alto’s Adventure</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"><em>Alto’s Odyssey</em></a>. It’s not an entirely new experience but, rather, one that changes the setting and adds some seemingly small — but very impactful — tweaks.</p><p>What makes the series so well suited to mobile is the way it balances approachability and depth. <em>Skate City</em> is extremely easy to pick up. It’s a side-scrolling game, so you’re always moving left to right, and all of the various tricks and moves are performed either by a swipe, tap, or hold. It all feels very natural. For example, each side of the touchscreen represents a side of your board, and even complex individual moves only require one input to pull off. So even if you don’t know what you’re doing, you can mash your way to some cool tricks. But what really makes it work is how, once you get the hang of things, you can chain together tricks in very satisfying ways.</p><p>This was all true of the original, and the core is the same in <em>New York</em>. The biggest change (aside from the location) is that levels all have multiple paths, so that if you time a jump or grind <em>just</em> right, you can make it to a new area with new possibilities. Given how much you’ll be grinding through the same streets, this extra layer adds some necessary variety. There are also a handful of new tricks, like being able to wall ride, that give you new tools to play with. On their own, these additions seem small. But together, they add just enough to make <em>New York</em> have its own feel.</p><p>Seemingly the most disappointing thing about the new game is that it’s restricted to a single city. The original <em>Skate City</em> was appropriately global; after a series of updates, it now has levels in Tokyo, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Venice, Miami, and Oslo. But even though <em>New York</em> only has, well, New York, there’s a decent amount of variety (and presumably more coming in the future).</p><p>At launch, there are three areas — Central Park, Brooklyn, and Manhattan — and each has its own distinct vibe, both in terms of how they look and the makeup of the levels. And once again, there are three modes to play through: one that teaches you the game through a series of tutorials; another that lets you put those skills to the test in pro challenges; and a free skate mode where you have time and space to be creative.</p><p>It’s this last mode that has had me, for the past week, huddled over my phone, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/style/fashion/a61736444/yuto-horigome-winning-skateboarding-gold-wearing-airpods-is-our-olympic-highlight/">headphones in</a>, approaching the same rails and staircases over and over trying to nail the exact line I’ve envisioned in my head. Just like skating in real life, it can be tedious and frustrating at times. But the satisfaction of pulling it off is worth it — and that playlist has helped pull me through.</p><p><small>Skate City: New York<em> is available now on Apple Arcade.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/return-tow-rk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The holidays are over, which means we're back at our desks.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://remapradio.com/video/lets-build-a-3d-model-of-patricks-new-office/" rel="noreferrer">the <em>Remap</em> crew helped Patrick work through ideas for a new office</a>, and over Thanksgiving and Christmas, Patrick finally made good them. Doing so, it turned out, proved to be a shockingly emotional experience beyond building desks and buying endless accessories.</p><p>Then again, how spaces define us has been a huge part of <em>Remap</em>, and what ultimately lead to the creation of the HOA podcast. We're all older, and while not necessarily wiser, we certainly find ourselves thinking about these topics a lot, and it's got us in our feelings.</p><p>Prepare for some Sad Dad thoughts, folks.</p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Back in the fall, inspired by the work Janet had done to make her work space more functional, I decided enough was enough with my own space, as well. I have written in the past about how my life as a reporter—where I’ve often written while huddled around half-broken laptops, cold coffee, and terrible seating—has made me complacent. Hell, one of my “offices” in a tiny San Francisco apartment was literally inside of a closet, because it’s all the space we had.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob, <em>I wrote in a closet for the better part of a year</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds ridiculous, but it’s part of a larger personality quirk/feature: I can get used to things. Think about all the times we’ve hung out with one another. How often have I expressed all that much interest in where we eat or drink? I pretty much never chime in beyond realizing that people are not picking something that is in a reasonable walking distance, and even then, I once let you guide us through a rain storm towards a place that, to your credit, had some terrific food.&nbsp;</p><p>But…I’m older now. I turn 40, despite what my face might tell you, next month. I find myself in a position where, despite being semi-recently laid off, I am in a good final position! (In no small thanks to the continued stability of my wife’s job while the weirdness of mine worked itself out.)</p><p>To that point, last month I asked our financial advisor, aka the guy who scares the shit out of me about how much I need to keep putting aside each month to prevent my daughters from being saddled with debt for the rest of their lives, to drum up a life insurance policy for my wife and I. There is a whole other story to tell about that process about how I was denied good coverage from a bunch of places because I had the good fortune of my dad dying of a heart attack, but we can get into that another day. The point is that I’m now paying for the kind of life insurance coverage that’s supposed to make my life easier, or my wife’s life easier, if great tragedy strikes.</p><p>I’m almost 40. My dad died when he was 56 years old—and I was 27. 13 years. In another 13, which feels simultaneously like an eternity and no time at all, I’ll be on the doorstep of that same age. I now forget which birthday it was, but there was one in his early 50s where he said “hey, I made it past the point where my dad passed away.” He didn’t make it much longer, though.</p><p>When I was in high school, my dad finally bought what he’d wanted his entire life: a small lake house in southern Wisconsin, where he spent his formative years. What do we spend all this time working and toiling, if not to finally, at some point, try and make ourselves happier? That what we’ve grown complacent with isn’t enough, that it’s okay to have a meaningful treat?</p><p>I did not expect the introduction to this back-and-forth to be so somber, but in unpacking and dismantling my old desk, I found the original print out of the eulogy I wrote for my father. In moving on from that desk, it felt like I was moving on from a different era in my life, too. I am not in a position where I expect to move homes anytime soon, so when you reinvent a room, it has many of the same emotional arcs as moving to, say, a new apartment. I wasn’t expecting that.</p><p>I’m writing this from my new L-shaped standing desk. Yes, Rob, I bought the biggest one, even though half the desk is empty. This morning, I answered emails and did other busy work while standing. A few hours later, I tapped a button, watched the desk lower, and sat in my new Aeron chair to begin typing this out. In a few hours, I’ll put this computer into sleep mode, walk over to my production suite, and stream with Cado. I’ve only spent 36 hours in this setup, and beyond the newness, it’s making me credibly happy. No, it was not cheap—but man, worth every penny.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m hoping to bring that mentality to other parts of my life, too.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@carlheyerdahl?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Carl Heyerdahl</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>One of the joys and frustrations as you age is that it’s easier to identify things that are worth prioritizing, and if you’re reasonably lucky you also have more resources to invest in those priorities. It’s joyful because you have all these moments where you realize how much you are being paid-back in experience for the money and time you invested in something for yourself. It’s frustrating because you realize you could have done some of this sooner and made life easier. Maybe not to the exact same degree, I have more money now than I did as a freelancer who had just moved to Boston with his grad student girlfriend. But often it’s the self-knowledge that is the real difference between then and now. There are things I could have benefited from back then, even if I would have had to do them on a shoestring, that I didn’t realize I needed until much later. You rejoice in solving a longstanding problem or removing a recurring irritation, but you also rue the years you spent “putting up” with something that in retrospect you didn’t need to.</p><p>MK had a moment like that when she realized we needed a stick vacuum. Simple thing, made a world of difference. We have a very <em>nice </em>stick vacuum and those have gotten better in ten years, but ultimately we would have benefited from one of those far more than the other stuff we’ve used over the years. It just didn’t click for her until this year that what she hated wasn’t vacuuming, it was dragging a vacuum around a house and wrestling with a long power cord. Small thing, no stakes at all really, but an example of what I mean.</p><p>When I got my Uplift desk, one of the extras I got with it was an anti-fatigue mat. I didn’t really need it in my office and I kind of forgot about it for a while, but a couple months ago I tossed it in front of my kitchen sink and realized that I was suddenly <em>comfortable </em>standing there doing dishes and chopping vegetables. I’d gotten used to how hard my kitchen floor was, and if you’d asked me I wouldn’t have said working in the kitchen caused me any discomfort much less pain, but really I’d just gotten habituated to enduring and ignoring a constant, mild level of irritation. I’d also, not coincidentally, lost a bit of interest in cooking and baking, subconsciously avoiding working in the kitchen without acknowledging that it had become physically unpleasant.</p><p>Again, these are small examples of what I’m talking about. Low-stakes stuff. But I think some of the same dynamics apply to higher-stakes stuff around family, work, and even how we conceive of ourselves and our vision of a good life. A lot of us are taught early that if we can avoid bothering other people with a need or a discomfort by enduring our adjusting our own expectations, then that’s what we should try to do. But if you’re really good at doing that, if you have a lot of resilience, endurance, or both, then you can end up being the proverbial frog being slowly boiled in a pot of water. It becomes habit to ignore a problem instead of checking for straightforward solutions.</p><p>A few years ago, my wife and I were on a walk and we spotted a group of turtles sunning themselves on a log in a river. She said she loved seeing turtles in the wild, not because of a particular love for the various species, but because the presence of healthy turtle populations is often a visible indicator of broader ecosystem health. For whatever reason that concept stuck in my head: that if you want to gauge the health of a system, sometimes it’s less about looking for problems than it is about looking for indicators of active well-being. Problems can be sneaky and hard to diagnose, and sometimes it’s easier to find signs that things are in a good place.</p><p>Since then, “is this good for turtles?” has become a shorthand in our house for a whole range of subtler questions. </p>

<p>It has been announced that there will be a network test for Elden Ring Nightreign from February 14 to February 17.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), the network test will be available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X, and applicants can register to gain access by January 20. To apply for registration to the Elden Ring Nightreign test, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a brand new co-op action-adventure game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced during The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>



<p>However, despite being a co-op game, the game will not be playable as a duo, as the developers announced that the game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to be played either solo or trio</a>. </p>



<p>The developers have already said that the network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,” the test description reads.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how much of the actual game content will be available to players, but anyone with a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X can sign up.</p>



<p>First released in 2022, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million units by September 2024, making it one of the best-selling games of all time, and the fastest-selling game published by Bandai Namco. Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC for Elden Ring, sold five million copies in its first three days of release.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-update-4-brings-bridge-building-new-maps-and-more.1079043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse have released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>update, and it's packing a new bridge-building mechanic, new maps to check out, and more.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-beta-none-glitch" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the medieval city-builder have brought the likes of bug fixes and gameplay improvements, but as the name implies, Update 4 is a bigger patch that introduces some major new features.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting two new maps, High Peaks and Winding River. No prizes for which one of those includes "a huge river", as Hooded Horse and Slavic Magic say. Naturally, that river leads on to the new bridge-building mechanic, which is also included in Update 4.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=ZE_PPcfh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=nYPQSCuR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords</em>' latest update brings tons of new features with it.</figcaption></figure><p>That's right: you can now use&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>' Road tool to build yourself bridges, which can be used to cross things like the aforementioned "huge river" included in the Winding River map.</p>

<p>Additionally, Update 4 brings with it new gameplay tweaks like an Overstock setting for taverns and marketplaces, an upgrade to the Stone Well, and a level 2 Tavern upgrade, as well as a new visual for the Tavern's first level.</p>

<p>All of this is in addition to an absolute onslaught of bug fixes, gameplay improvements, and other changes. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>Update 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, but you might want to grab a coffee before you do, as it's pretty long.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, it's a medieval city-builder-slash-strategy game that emphasizes realism in its simulation. You'll build and maintain a village, see to the needs of its citizens, and even grow your empire through conquest of neighboring lands.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">released back in April</a>, attracting over 100,000 players on Steam within just a few hours of its launch (which is particularly impressive given that it's also available on Game Pass).</p>

<p>In just a few days,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">broke a million</a>. They would go on to hit&nbsp;two million in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">under three weeks</a>. It's safe to say Hooded Horse has a hit on its hands with this one.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. It's also available as part of Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.</p>

But last night, the Japanese company finally spoke up, only to tell us all to sit back down.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “The gaming hardware that Genki is claiming to be Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by Nintendo.” </p><p>That’s what we’ve got, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://japan.cnet.com/article/35228142/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35228142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">given in response to a request for comment by the Japanese <em>CNET</em></a></span>, translated by machines and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the people at <em>Automaton</em></a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-2-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2 come at a pivotal moment. CoD remains absolute and steadfast in its consistency, but its popularity is waning. Season 2 is a chance to rekindle the FPS fire, and we’re here to run through the latest info.</p>



<p>When former Call of Duty World Champion legend Seth “Scump” Abner describes CoD as “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scump-on-call-of-duty-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kind of depressing</a>,” it’s deeply concerning. Many are switching over for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Season One Eternal Night Falls Update</a>. Player counts are dropping big time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> isn’t as hot as it was, despite fun variations in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-squid-game-event-release-date-details-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game event</a>. Warzone isn’t doing so hot either, and Season 2 is paramount to CoD’s coming weeks.</p>



<p>Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 2 needs to be special and must hit harder than an Archangel Launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-amp-warzone-season-2-release-date">Black Ops &amp; Warzone Season 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s see if CoD can restore some faith. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2’s release date is January 28 and it was confirmed by Activision through patch notes.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">January 9 patch notes blog</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 discussed stability fixes. It goes into greater detail, and ends up saying, “<strong>Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s quite uncommon for a date to be revealed this way, but we’re not complaining. We already imagined this to be the date due to the Battle Pass end date, but it’s now official. You only don’t have long left to complete your Season 1 Battle Pass and secure limited-time unlocks.</p>



<h2 id="h-possible-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-2-content">Possible Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 2 Content</h2>



<p>There have been no leaks or suggestions as to what content is coming in Season 2. But it’s safe to assume Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone are getting the usual slew of content: <strong>New Maps, Guns, Perks, limited-time modes, Operator Bundles, and a new Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s funny, sometimes we know of at least something fresh by now, but we don’t—and no one does. Season 2 is being kept under wraps, and fingers crossed it’s because it’s a big one. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players want a Ranked game mode without hackers, the Warzone community wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> back now, and Zombies is unlikely to get major content after the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sword-upgrades-in-citadelle-des-morts-bo6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle del Morts</a>—an LTM could be fun given the novelty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-win-dead-light-green-light-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Light Green Light</a>.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’re going to update this guide once we learn any news or rumors about Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-bo6-amp-warzone-season-2-battle-pass">BO6 &amp; Warzone Season 2 Battle Pass</h2>



<p>Again, it’s not officially revealed, <strong>but a Season 2 Battle Pass is inevitable for Black Ops 6 and Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>An even bigger question is if Activision is going to continue with additional Battle Passes. The Squid Game event didn’t just bring new game modes and special skins, but also a <strong>controversial Event Pass</strong>. It had a free version, along with a Premium Tier. This didn’t go down well with the player base, so we’ll see if this is addressed once Season 2 is announced.</p>



<hr>



<p>Call of Duty is a huge talking point at present. What do you like and dislike about it? Is Black Ops 6 dying? Does Warzone need a content injection? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>

<section><p>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap created a new kind of magical fantasy by showing us an unseen side of Hyrule at microscopic scale.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, January 10, 2025. Below, we look back at how the team came up with a playful sense of scale as its central hook.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda series is filled with dynamics that stretch and alter the world of Hyrule. Whether it be going back in time or into a realm of darkness, these add a new element of exploration that you wouldn't see in a peaceful Hyrule. The goal with many of these design choices was to inspire wonder--to give players a reason to explore familiar areas they've seen several times before. The Minish Cap's shrinking feature is one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers achieving that goal.</p><p dir="ltr">Recent games like Tinykin, It Takes Two, and Grounded have explored what it's like to explore the world while tiny, but few have created the dichotomy that The Minish Cap had with its shrinking feature. It encouraged fascination with the mundane--anything and everything could be hiding Link's next discovery.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we started thinking about what that gimmick could be for Minish Cap, first, we knew it couldn't be that far-removed or out-there from the world of Zelda," said The Minish Cap director Hidemaro Fujibayashi in a <a href="https://shmuplations.com/minishcap2/" rel="nofollow ">2004 interview</a> in Nintendo Dream magazine. "I started thinking, what feature[s] of these game worlds could we possibly expand on, what dimension could we explore? "Front and Reverse, Past and Future, Light and Darkness… we'd done all these before, but could some other pairing remain? I racked my brain until I realized--ah hah, if we make Link small, that would be like entering a whole 'nother world within his own."</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap's hallmark shrinking feature led to an overworld that was absolutely packed with puzzles to solve. Its clever use throughout the game make it one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers inspiring wonder, and it's an aspect of the game that still stands out 20 years later.</p><p dir="ltr">While individual dungeons and the overworld are packed with fascinating content to explore, the mere idea that an entire village could be hidden inside a tree or rock inspires a Breath of the Wild-like sense of wonder that was somehow accomplished with 2004 technology.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfEMNbjLd3Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UfEMNbjLd3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Capcom's The Legend of Zelda adventure, the world of Hyrule has tiny beings called the Minish packed into stumps, under rocks, and in dozens of other places across the kingdom. These Minish are everywhere, even under the snoozing nose of a shoemaker. Link and the rest of Hyrule have never heard of these creatures, making further discovery of how they live a wonderful story thread to pull on.</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap lets you yank on that thread early on in your adventure, shortly after peril comes to Hyrule. Soon after the villain of the entry, Vaati, unleashes a horde of monsters across Hyrule, Link travels to The Minish Woods to find the Minish, retrieve four elemental stones, restore the sword of legend, and restore Hyrule and a Zelda, the latter of whom has been turned to stone.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of this is standard Zelda flare, although the leadup to discovering the Minish for the first time establishes the larger-than-life level design that will fill the rest of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Link's new sidekick, Ezlo, shrinks him down using a portal found in The Minish Woods, eventually leading him through logs, over drifting pondweed, and around life-size sticks and acorns to find the miniature race of people who would kick off the rest of his adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back, this moment doesn't seem incredibly impressive on its own, but its ingenuity is found in how it sets up the rest of the game. Navigating the small platforming section and keeping an eye out for areas that can only be explored while small is what, as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said, turns the entire overworld into something just as challenging as the series' trademark dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">"Dungeons have a certain limited format to them, right? Find keys, advance further, defeat the boss," Aonuma said. "In contrast, the outside world, the field map, can offer more multifaceted gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Kinstone fragments scattered across the overworld feel like standard collectibles at first, but they amount to more by unlocking other areas of the map. Find two of the same type, fuse them, and the classic Zelda discovery jingle will play--meaning a new path opens up, a chest is revealed, or something similar happens.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these Kinstones are found within puzzles that require you to shrink down and climb a bookcase, run across bakery shelves, or even dodge gigantic raindrops: simple acts that give you an entirely new angle through which to view Hyrule.</p><p dir="ltr">"Collecting the fragments opens up areas far from your current location," Aonuma said. "In a sense, this makes the overworld map itself act like one big dungeon."</p><p dir="ltr">This sense of wonder came from Capcom's goal to shift away from their design approach on Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, and Four Swords. While they ended up building off of the Gnat Hat--an item that shrunk Link down in Four Swords--they wanted to replicate Nintendo's approach to Zelda by focusing on worldbuilding. In doing so, they just happened to create an amazing world that came from posing a simple question: What's hidden beneath and within all the familiar workings of Lake Hylia and Lon Lon Ranch?</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make a 'mainline' traditional 2D Zelda game. Traversing overworld maps, exploring dungeons. The essence of Zelda," Fujibayashi said. "I see it as following in the steps of the Famicom Zelda and A Link to the Past, but a more powered-up version for today's hardware."</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring cracks in rocks and tiny holes in the side of cottages in 2004 is the equivalent of scaling the side of the mountain in Breath of the Wild in 2017. The biggest contrast is the technology, as Capcom worked within the parameters of Game Boy Advance hardware in order to instill a magic that could be felt through a 2.9-inch screen. That tiny, mystical world hidden amongst fantastic combat and puzzles makes The Minish Cap one of the most memorable Zelda games today,</p>

                <p>Nintendo's next console, the apparent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, is the talk of the town in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show this week due in part to the peripheral company Genki claiming to know what Nintendo is cooking up. Now, for the first time, Nintendo has broken its silence and commented on the leaks.</p><p>A spokesperson told Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Sankei Shimbun</a> (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">translated by Automaton</a>) that the images and videos from CES are "not official." A spokesperson told <a href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35228142/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNET Japan</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), "The gaming hardware that Genki claims to be Nintendo hardware at CES is official and was not provided to the company by Nintendo."</p><p>At CES, Genki created a mockup of the Switch 2 that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">claimed was based on a real Switch 2 console that it saw</a>, going on to say the company was surprised by the media attention. Later, however, Genki told <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> that its mockup was in fact based only on leaks, not from seeing the system first hand, and that it doesn't actually know what Nintendo is planning.</p><p>Genki also said at CES that it expects the Switch 2 to launch in April 2025. In addition to the leaks that stem from Genki, other reports claim to reveal the first details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-switch-2-renders-grant-a-360-degree-look-at-the-console/1100-6528727/" data-ref-id="1100-6528727">Switch 2's new Joy-Cons, which could include a new feature and a more ergonomic design. </a></p><p>Nintendo has confirmed it will announce its next console by the end of March 2025, so a reveal could happen very soon. Many are expecting the console to then launch later in the year.</p><p>The Switch 2, or whatever the system may be called, has enormous shoes to fill, as the original Switch sold more than 146 million systems and 1.3 billion games.</p>

<p>The concert will take place to mark the new year and will see Astra Yao performing at the "iconic" Starloop landmark in New Eridu. However, all is not as it seems, and there's a conspiracy brewing that may threaten Astra.</p>

<p>Naturally, Astra Yao is one of the two new S-rank Agents you can recruit in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5. She's an Ether Support Agent who can provide damage bonuses to your squad, and she's also the game's "first healing character", with her Ultimate restoring HP to your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.5-new-characters.jpg?itok=j7tAOTf4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.5-new-characters.jpg?itok=MUaP8O4f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 will bring two new characters for you to recruit.</figcaption></figure><p>Your second new character in this update is Evelyn, Astra Yao's "trusted guardian". She's a Fire Attack Agent who can unleash a Chain Attack by herself, so she's a pretty powerful addition to your lineup.</p>

<p>In addition to the above two characters, you can also expect reruns of Ellen and Qingyi in Version 1.5's banners, as well as a new S-rank Banbgoo in the form of Snap, which comes complete with a camera.</p>

<p>Version 1.5 also brings with it new minigames, including a new parkour-based arcade game by the name of Mach 25, which allows you to "race with various vehicles". Plenty of other new gameplay changes and features are coming in Version 1.5 too, so make sure you add January 22nd to your calendar.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, it's part of HoYoverse's live-service gacha RPG lineup, alongside&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>(and also&nbsp;<em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>).</p>

<p>The game is more overtly action-oriented than its stablemates, and it's less fantasy-inspired too, taking place in an urban setting reminiscent of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.5 lands on January 22nd.</p>

"Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The phrasing is a little confusing, as it makes it sound as though Claws of Awaji will only be available to those who pre-purchase the game, similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-day-one-missions-only-available-through-season-pass-or-by-preordering">the previously announced "bonus mission" Thrown to the Dogs</a>. This would be unusual, however, as major expansions such as this are usually reserved for Season Passes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">Ubisoft is ditching the Season Pass model for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> following major  practice shake-ups <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">in the wake of Star Wars Outlaws underperforming</a>. Alongside scrapping the Season Pass, which would typically let players access two larger expansions for an additional $30 or so, Ubisoft is cancelling plans to charge players more to play on launch day. It is therefore assumed DLC expansions such as Claws of Awaji will be made free for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though details are restricted to the brief paragraph published to Steam, the name Claws of Awaji does shed some light on what players will find in the DLC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-official-collectors-edition-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">Ubisoft quietly revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows' world map in the Collector's Edition trailer</a>, which showed nine detailed regions plus one small island left blank.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/untitled-1736512942490.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows' world map, per the Collector's Edition trailer.

Awaji Island is perhaps most famous for its prominence in the Japanese religion of Shinto, where it is said to be the first island created in the world through the legend of Izanagi and Izanami.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Assassin's Creed has delved further and further into mythology and not just history with recent releases, especially in the role-playing game series which Shadows belongs to, fans will perhaps get to delve into Japanese legends with the addition of the Claws of Awaji.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be longer than expected before this is possible, of course, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month">Ubisoft has delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows once again</a>, this time to March 20. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">It was first pushed to February 14</a> from its November 12 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes">investor frustration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design, and combined with the two delays, fans are growing increasingly impatient as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-200k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a new milestone almost four months after the remaster's initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1877626459386212769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), Dragami confirms that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide since its release on September 12th.</p>

<p>While it's true those aren't exactly sales on the level of triple-A hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>or indie smashes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>is a remastered version of an already-niche action game from 2012, so 200,000 isn't a bad figure at all to reach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=0zu3GJbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=Lku5SkXH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has hit the 200,000 sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>remaster was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">announced as a remake</a> back in 2022, with producer Yoshimi Yasuda assuring fans at that point that the game would remain "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>It was officially named&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024" rel="nofollow">the following year</a>, at which point its release was also pushed back to 2024. Following that, Yasuda proved himself true to his word when it turned out that&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">serve as a remaster</a> rather than a full remake.</p>

<p>Back in June, the remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date was set for September</a>. It's one of two 2012 action-adventure games involving auteur Goichi Suda, otherwise known as Suda51, to get itself a remaster this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date" rel="nofollow">the other being&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2012 action game, which was originally developed by Suda51's company Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>

<p>Maintaining the original game's story and atmosphere,&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>features upgraded visuals, "faster action", and plenty of other quality-of-life improvements to bring cheerleader Juliet Starling's zombie-slaying adventure into the modern era.</p>

<p>You can check out <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9NTPB0C2028V/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. Here's hoping all this renewed interest in 2012 action games leads to some kind of remaster for&nbsp;<em>Binary Domain</em>. Come on, Sega.</p>

Whether it was the shifting alliances and weaponized duplicity of <em>Shōgun</em>, Gambit’s shocking death in <em>X-Men ‘97</em>, or <em>Baby Reindeer</em>’s penchant for delving to unseen depths of abuse and psychosis, 2024's best shows were mindfucks. And it’s looking like 2025 will be no different.</p><p>To prepare you and your precious brain for the onslaught of twists, cliffhangers, and alien explosions, we have a quick guide to six shows we can’t wait to have fuck up our minds in the best ways possible.  <em>&nbsp;</em><br></p></div></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>February 6</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/invincible-presents-atom-eve/gallery&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/invincible-presents-atom-eve/gallery"><em>Invincible</em></a></span><em> </em>has pulverized our senses with superhero collective slaughtering, humans imprisoned in murderous cyborg bodies, and an orgy full of clones, and they aren’t pulling their punches in the third season. After Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun), aka Invincible, crosses a moral boundary by killing Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) in a multiversal melee for the ages, we may finally be in for his full power to be put on display in <em>Invincible</em>’s typical bloody manner. By the looks of the trailer, which shows Invincible mangling a humanoid cyborg and his angrily retaliating against his “boss” Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins), we’re likely in for feats of superhuman brutality only achievable in animation crafted by some severely disturbed writers.  </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>January 17</p><p>Boredom has never been more suspenseful than it is in the blindingly white halls of Lumon on Apple TV+’s standout series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616"><em>Severance</em></a></span>. We all spent an entire season trying to reprogram our brains to understand a world where humans can sever their consciousness between work and personal life. Then, we spent the next two years trying to figure out why a company that severs people’s minds is herding goats, what happens to severed workers when they’re “fired,” and what the hell these people are actually doing for work. We previewed the second season, and there will be no shortage of tantalizing oddities (and goats) as the the severed workers plot a revolt against Lumon after being awakened in the real world at the end of Season 1. Just as we get answers to questions about the aftermath of the Innies’ awakenings and the complicated four-way relationship between Innie and Outie Mark (Adam Scott) with Innie Helly (Britt Lower) and Outie Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman), we get bombarded with more questions about the perils of reintegration and why there is a child working on the severed floor. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>April 2025</p><p>Watching deadly mutated humans hunt survivors down using the quietest of sounds is terrifying enough before you remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-ces-2025-abby-ellie-dina-1851734101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-ces-2025-abby-ellie-dina-1851734101"><em>The Last Of Us</em></a></span> is based on a video game series and that the acclaimed HBO show hasn’t touched the saddest parts of yet. At the end of the first season, Joel (Pedro Pascal) saves Ellie (Bella Ramsey) from the Fireflies, a resistance group who was going to kill her in the hopes of devising a cure for the plague that has ravaged humanity. He later lies to her about what happened, saying that it simply didn’t work and sparing her the tiny detail that he killed them all. If the second season follows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660"><em>The Last of Us II</em></a></span>’s story (and, in broad strokes at least, it likely will), well, let’s just say that we’re in for even more harrowing and devastating events. The trailer for season two hints at the infected evolving into weather-resistant monstrosities looking to invade Joel and Ellie’s safe haven of Jackson, and posing an existential threat that will surely break our hearts and minds.</p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: N/A</strong></p><p>First off, rest in peace to Chance Perdomo, the late actor who played Andre Anderson in <em>Gen V, </em>and who passed away from a motorcycle accident four months after the first season ended. While we won’t get to see the full, violent extent of his metal manipulation, the show has plenty of mind-bending absurdism to go around. The show that had a superhuman explode someone’s penis by redirecting all of the blood in his body to his groin has a lot more of <em>The Boys</em> universe to show, with no element more intriguing than the virus developed in <em>Gen V</em> with the demonstrable power to mutilate and kill superpowered folks, or “supes.” The last season ended with a school-wide massacre at Godolkin University between supes and normal humans, and the aftermath will likely expose us to the full scope of supe miscreants from that school. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>March 4</p><p>Charlie Cox, who plays Matt Murdock (aka Daredevil) in the <em>Daredevil </em>franchise, has said the Disney+ series <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-actor-born-again-darker-netflix-show/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-actor-born-again-darker-netflix-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">darker</a></span> than much of the original Netflix series. Remember, the Netflix series had Daredevil famously beating up droves of bad guys in a dark corridor in what is still one of the most iconic moments in any Marvel TV series or film. To get darker than that would really require them to up the ante, and Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) asking Murdock if all that’s left of him “the devil of Hell’s Kitchen” in the trailer makes me believe that the show will be delving deep into the character’s dark side. Plus, we still need to know what happened to him after Thanos snapped away half of the planet, which will surely have us trying to rearrange the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637">MCU timeline</a></span> in our heads. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>N/A</p><p>In Rian Johnson’s remarkable mystery-of-the-week Peacock show, Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) is a former casino worker on the run from her criminal ex-bosses after she uncovers murder and corruption at the casino. One caveat: She has an uncanny ability to detect when someone is lying, a skill that has her solving crimes while on her escape route. What really messes with viewers’ minds is not only trying to figure out how certain crimes were committed, but how seemingly disparate characters and plot points will be meshed together in her big reveal near the end of each episode. She once solved an elderly man’s murder in a retirement facility by detecting the bullshit in two unassuming old ladies who had been plotting this murder because the elderly man got them both arrested during their younger, militant days as anti-government revolutionaries who plotted bombings and assassinations. We may not know exactly when the second season comes, but we sure as hell know that it’ll be full of mysteries the smartest viewer can’t crack. (That won’t stop us from trying, though.) </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-gets-3-0-beta-update-reducing-artifacts-and-improving-latency/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-gets-3-0-beta-update-reducing-artifacts-and-improving-latency/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The software Lossless Scaling has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/527583114757669394?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major update from developer THS. The Frame Generation component that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> exactly one year ago has been upgraded to version 3.0 (beta), introducing what the developer has described as major improvements across the board in quality, latency, and performance.</p>
<p>Flickering and border artifacts have been reduced, benefiting motion clarity and smoothness alike. GPU load has also shrunk by a sizable 40% compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-universal-frame-generation-2-0-out-now-improves-efficiency-noticeably-reduces-artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSFG 2</a> x2 in non-Performance Mode, while multipliers above x2 have had their GPU load reduced by over 45% compared to the previous version of the software. Perhaps the most welcome enhancements are those in the latency area. According to the developer's latency test, Lossless Scaling Frame Generation 3.0 has 24% lower latency than 2.0.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Picture5-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There's more. This new release unlocks frame rate generation multipliers up to x20. However, the developer shared some recommendations to get optimal results:</p>
<p><em>Base frame rate: A minimum of 30 FPS is required (40 FPS or higher is preferred, with 60 FPS being ideal) at 1080p. </em><em>For best overall experience, locking the game frame rate is recommended. This helps to avoid 100% GPU load (reducing its impact on latency) and ensures smoother frame pacing.</em></p>
<p><em>For higher resolution, use at higher than recommended frame rates or use the "Resolution Scale" option to downscale input to 1080p:</em><br>
<em>For 1440p, set it to 75%.</em><br>
<em>For 4K, set it to 50%.</em></p>
<p><em>Higher multipliers (e.g., X5 or above) are best suited for high refresh rate setups, such as:</em></p>
<p><em>48 FPS × X5 for 240Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X6 for 360Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X8 for 480Hz.</em></p>
<p>While new and recent PC games support natively integrated frame generation (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-frame generation</a>) technologies from NVIDIA and/or AMD, older games can still benefit from this tool, especially when heavily modded.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LSFGUI3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>THS also announced that an opt-in Lossless Scaling User Interface 3.0 beta can now be selected by going into your Steam library, right-clicking on the software, selecting properties and then beta from the Betas tab. Last but not least, Windows 11 24H2 users can once again select the DXGI Capture API thanks to Microsoft's recent KB5046617 update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340153/ces-2025-best-new-tech-tv-car-wearable<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>There is no other week like CES. Very nearly the entire tech industry descends on Las Vegas to give the world an early look at the inventions and ideas they think will define the year. More new, surprising, exciting, and oftentimes ridiculous ideas are debuted on any given day at CES than during most other weeks of the year.</p><p>It’s a ton to keep up with — and it’s also a whole lot of fun. <em>The Verge</em>’s team has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">on the ground</a> in Nevada to try out the wildest products we can get our hands on. There’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337606/ces-2025-smart-home-tv-cameras-power-bank-robot-smart-glasses">a lot of stuff we love</a>. A lot of stuff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338251/ces-2025-weirdest-tech-gadgets-robots">that weirds us out</a>. And a lot of stuff that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340049/honda-zero-saloon-suv-prototype-spec-ces-photos">just downright fun</a> to look at.</p><p>But at the end of the day, some of these ideas and gadgets stuck with us the most. They nailed the execution, surprised us with a great new concept, or otherwise made us leap to tell someone what we’d just seen. These are the things we can’t stop talking about — our best of CES 2025.</p><p><h3>Best TV</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24339135/panasonic-z95b-oled-tv-hands-on-ces-2025">Panasonic Z95B OLED</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Panasonic’s Z95B OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Most years at CES, it’d be a guaranteed lock that either LG or Samsung would have the most impressive TV on display in Las Vegas. And sure enough, both the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336168/lg-2025-oled-tv-m5-g5-c5-b5-features-specs">LG G5</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336442/samsung-2025-tv-oled-mini-led-s95f-qn90f-features">Samsung’s S95F</a> look like superb offerings for 2025. We’ve truly entered the brightness wars era of the OLED TV market. LG Display and Samsung Display manage to outdo themselves every year with panels that, at this point, are suitable for any viewing environment and make HDR content pop like never before.&nbsp;</p><p>But at CES 2025, it’s the Panasonic Z95B OLED that I keep circling back to as my favorite. After a long hiatus from the US TV market, Panasonic is coming back for its crown. Like the G5, it features a new four-layer tandem OLED display that boosts brightness to new highs — this time <em>without</em> the <a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/en/2024/01/a-new-era-of-oled-picture-quality-introducing-meta-technology-2-0/">micro-lens array technology</a> that LG Display spent the last two years hyping. It also includes an impressive Dolby Atmos speaker array (tuned by Technics) that will rule out any need for a soundbar for many buyers. That audio hardware results in this being a thick TV by today’s standards: Panasonic obviously favored nailing the picture and sound aspects over a thin design. And you know what? I’m here for it.</p><p>And look, I know: it <em>sucks</em> that Panasonic’s TVs run Fire TV OS. I hope that Amazon and Panos Panay take a sledgehammer to this software in the future and give us something more befitting of such a premium TV. But with Samsung and LG both cramming AI gimmicks down our throats — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337033/lg-samsung-microsoft-copilot-smart-tvs-ces-2025">they’ve added AI buttons to their remotes</a>, even — suddenly just plugging an Apple TV into the Z95B and doing my best to ignore Amazon’s software doesn’t seem so bad. <em>– Chris Welch</em></p><p><h3>Best wearable</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340208/ces-2025-smart-glasses-rokid-halliday-xreal-vuzix-nuance-audio">Rokid Glasses</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>The Rokid Glasses have a display etched into both lenses.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Smart glasses dominated the wearables world at this year’s show. While there were certainly more “advanced” smart glasses out there, Rokid’s stood out because they answered a simple question: “What would it be like if the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses had a display?”</p><p>The micro-etched display on the front of the Rokid Glasses is discreet — almost invisible from the front. There’s no weird protrusion like with the old Google Glass, and it uses a monochrome green light for better visibility in brighter surroundings. It may not be the AR of science fiction, but adding a simple heads-up display felt surprisingly useful. You can see real-time translations — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134180/humane-ai-pin-translation-wearables">I’m a huge translation tech skeptic</a>, but even I have to admit the translation demo worked pretty well on a noisy, busy show floor. There’s a teleprompter function, which feels handy for keeping notes on hand if your job involves a lot of presentations. For taking pictures, you can also see a mini viewfinder that helps you frame a shot. Compared to the Meta glasses, these were also much more lightweight.</p><p>This wasn’t the only version of monochrome monocular smart glasses on the floor — I also tried pairs from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334030/halliday-smart-glasses-ai-tiny-display-frame-availability-price-ces">Halliday</a> and Even Realities. But Rokid’s display was the largest and packed in the most functionality. Smart glasses have a long way to go, and of course I only got a brief demo. But what I saw felt like a practical, approachable take that even my non-techie neighbor might find cool. <em>– Victoria Song</em></p><p><h3>Biggest in show </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">Nitro Blaze 11</a></h4></p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 handheld gaming PC has a 10.95-inch screen. It weighs 2.3 pounds. It’s so big. Maybe <a href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck">too big</a>. But I kind of want it anyway? <em>– Jay Peters</em></p><p><h3>Best car</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338134/honda-zero-saloon-suv-ev-asimo-os-ces">Honda Zero</a></h4></p><p>Sure, we saw Honda’s new global EV series in concept form at last year’s CES. And sure, EV sales are, shall we say, not looking so great these days, with very little relief on the horizon. But Honda still helped revitalize what was otherwise a sleepy show for auto enthusiasts with the introduction of the Honda 0 Saloon and Honda 0 SUV.</p><p>You have to hand it to the company’s designers, they didn’t pull any punches: there’s a dash of Lamborghini Countach, a dusting of Aston Martin’s Lagonda Shooting Brake, and more than a hint of AMC Gremlin. In other words, plenty of ’70s / ’80s vibes to offset the future shock of the minimalistic interior and marketing-speak about “software-defined vehicles.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whether Honda sticks with this exact design for the final production version, I’m not holding my breath. But there’s enough here that’s weird and different and interesting that some of it is sure to survive through customer deliveries — if we ever get there. <em>– Andrew J. Hawkins</em></p><p><h3>Best friend</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24325152/yukai-engineering-mirumi-robot-ces">Mirumi</a></h4></p><p>Mirumi has absolutely no purpose beyond being a cute fluffy wearable… thing. I’m completely enamored. Give me an army of the little suckers to match every bag.</p><p>The fuzzy sloth-like robot companion latches onto your purse or backpack strap and is designed to imitate a shy (but curious) baby. It doesn’t make noise — a blessing for some — but it will hide its face when touched and move its head around to look at people or objects it detects. It’ll even shake its head to simulate distress if you jiggle it around.&nbsp;</p><p>Mirumi’s creator Yukai Engineering says the robot is supposed to re-create the “joyful experiences” you feel when a real baby glances your way. And given our ga-ga reactions to its googly eyes and stinkingly adorable movements, I’d say it kind of works? There are no fancy (or annoying) AI features at work here, just a solidly simple concept that aims to make you smile.

Later, Huang also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338939/nvidia-jensen-huang-hints-arm-desktop-cpu">hinted at plans to launch a desktop CPU</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><p>But the biggest flex of all might be that Nvidia is simply everywhere.

I always assumed the Afeela was going to be expensive, but I didn’t expect it to be <em>that</em> expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>The top trim starting at $102,900 just feels egregious, especially when the upper tiers of the EV market feel completely saturated at the moment. Who is this even for? If you want a luxurious interior and great range, you’re better off with a Lucid Air. If you want an overdose of screens, get a Mercedes EQS. If you want incredible software, your best bet is Rivian. Need to feel like a plutocrat? Just get a BMW i7. I’m just saying, there are options! And all of the above are for sale in <em>all</em> 50 states, not just California, like the Afeela.&nbsp;</p><p>Could it become a more attractive option in the future? Sure. But if what we’re seeing today is a sign of more out-of-touch marketing to come, I’m not really Afeelin’ it. <em>– Andrew J.

It’s a simple sales pitch: a SodaStream for your Hydro Flask. And I think based on that pitch alone, you’ll know whether it’s for you. I’m a sparkling water addict, so it’s definitely for me. It’s simple enough: fill your bottle with cold water, put the SodaTop on top, and drop in a CO2 canister. You twist on a lid to puncture the seal and carbonate your water. Then you’re good to go.</p><p>You might be tempted to ask questions like, “Couldn’t you just make some fizzy water with a SodaStream and pour it into a Hydro Flask?” or “Can’t you just buy a bottle of sparkling water?” or “Is it really that portable?” To which I say, <em>shhhh</em>. The point here is that it’s a tidy solution and you don’t have to be <em>at home</em> to use it. If I still worked in an office, I’d keep one of these at my desk for sure. And I’ve already given up a lot of my kitchen counter space to beverage-making devices, so just using this at home would help me keep that space free. Honestly, it’s just a great, simple solution to the “sparkling water on the go” problem for those of us afflicted with sparkling water addiction. <em>– Allison Johnson</em></p><p><h3>Best beauty tech </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24334941/loreal-cell-bioprint-ces-2025-skincare-beauty-tech">L’Oreal Cell BioPrint</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>L’Oreal Cell BioPrint and an iPad showing its analysis.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>L’Oréal’s Cell BioPrint blew me away. The mini-lab analyzes photos of your skin and a skin sample from your cheeks to tell you about your skin’s health. It can tell you about your chronological age versus your biological one (aka is your current routine working well?). It can also assess how you’re doing with issues like wrinkles, skin tone, skin barrier, oiliness, and pore size — or if it’s likely to become a problem in the future. It can also analyze whether you’re responsive to certain ingredients, starting with retinol.</p><p>Skincare buying is a minefield. There are thousands of products touting this or that hero ingredient, all promising to fix any insecurity you might have with your complexion. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about skincare, and even I have a hard time figuring out what products I actually need in my routine. Something like this could help folks filter what’s worth trying and what’s just overconsumption. (And according to my results, I should probably start using retinol.) <em>–</em> <em>Victoria Song</em></p><p><h3>Best charger </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24334476/baseus-enercore-wall-charger-retractable-usb-c-primetrip-vr2-car-automotive">Baseus PrimeTrip VR2 Max car charger</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Baseus’ PrimeTrip VR2 Max car charger.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Baseus</cite></p></div><p>At home, you’ve probably got charging cables stashed all over the place, but inside your car is a different story.

Naturally, that includes new sets from LG and Samsung, which are deploying AI to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336168/lg-2025-oled-tv-m5-g5-c5-b5-features-specs">futz with your picture and sound settings</a> and let you talk to a chatbot or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336442/samsung-2025-tv-oled-mini-led-s95f-qn90f-features">analyze what’s on your screen</a>.

But Lenovo didn’t stop there — its sophomore effort is far more comfortable and affordable as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The grips are nicely sculpted, the trigger throw is adjustable, the battery’s slightly bigger, and it comes with an all-important variable refresh rate (VRR) screen at a more appropriate 1200p resolution for its mobile chip, both of which should mean smoother gameplay.

The flagship RTX 5090 will debut on January 30th priced at $1,999, giving you a two-slot card with 32GB of GDDR7 memory that Nvidia promises can double the frame rates in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> compared to the RTX 4090.&nbsp;</p><p>But if that’s too expensive for you — because, seriously, just look at that price tag —&nbsp;Nvidia is also promising major performance leaps lower in the line, saying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">the new $549 RTX 5070 can keep up with an RTX 4090</a>, the previous generation’s $1,599 flagship.

If the RTX 50-series can live up to Nvidia’s promises, then this is going to be an impressive start to the next generation of GPUs. <em>–Tom Warren</em></p><p><h3>Best gadget that looks like a toaster, but you definitely should not put bread into</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337684/swippitt-phone-charging-system-ces-2025">Swippitt</a></h4></p><p>The phone toaster isn’t actually a toaster, but I can’t stop calling it that. It’s part of a system called Swippitt — and it’s the wackiest, cleverest charging gadget I’ve seen in a long time. The idea is that you put your phone in a Swippitt Link battery case, which has a 3,500mAh cell in the back. It boosts your phone’s charge, and when you need some more power, you insert the phone, case and all, into the Swippitt Hub — which is the toaster bit. In two seconds, it swaps the battery in your case for a fresh one, and you go on your way. There are five batteries at the ready in the hub, so anytime you need a top-off, you just drop in your phone. No more tethered charging or waiting.</p><p>I thought it was annoying until I grasped that last part. You don’t charge your phone, you just use this gadget to swap in a fresh booster battery, like, forever. No more charging (well, until you travel somewhere). It’s expensive as hell, though: $450 for the hub and $120 for each case. So it might make sense if you can get your whole family on board with it, or you just really, really hate charging your phone. But most of all, it’s a clever gadget that tries something different and doesn’t have a lot of other extra stuff you don’t need (looking at you, AI TVs). That’s the kind of CES gadget I love to see. <em>– Allison Johnson</em></p><p><h3>Best smart home device</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24333438/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-plus-pro-price-specs-release-date">Switchbot K20 Plus Pro</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Switchbot’s K20 Plus Pro with a security camera and air purifier slash wireless charging platform.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>This robot is ingenious, a bit ridiculous, and one of the wildest smart home inventions I’ve seen in a long time — which is what CES gadgets are all about.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24333438/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-plus-pro-price-specs-release-date">Switchbot’s K20 Plus Pro</a> is a robot vacuum that can have different devices strapped to its head using the company’s modular “FusionPlatform.” As well as being able to deliver items around your home, it can have various SwitchBot products attached to it to perform tasks autonomously: purify your air, be a mobile home security camera, and carry your tablet around for you. They’ve even made an attachment to put a mini fridge on top. (So, yes, it can bring you a beer.)</p><p>What intrigues me the most here is that its FusionPlatform is completely open; you can plug any device into its various power ports and customize this robot to do what you need. That’s smart. <em>– Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</em></p><p><h3>Best use of E Ink </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24328013/pocketbook-e-ink-sharp-inkposter-electronic-paper-spectra-6">PocketBook InkPoster</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>The PocketBook InkPoster.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: PocketBook</cite></p></div><p>There weren’t many E Ink devices announced at CES this year, but that doesn’t mean PocketBook’s new InkPoster wins by default. It’s one of the first consumer devices to use E Ink’s advanced Spectra 6 color e-paper technology that can produce close to 60,000 colors. Compared to the limited capabilities of the color e-paper screens used in devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303322/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-review">Kindle Colorsoft</a>, images and artwork on the InkPoster will look more like they’re painted on an actual canvas or printed on photo paper.</p><p>Companies like Samsung want you to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs">repurpose your living room TV</a> as a display for digital art, but the InkPoster could be a better alternative that’s easier on the eyes without a brightly backlit screen. It’s also completely wireless: it relies on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for uploading artwork and images and a rechargeable battery for power that only needs to be charged about once a year. If you’re indecisive about what to hang on your walls, the InkPoster won’t make you choose.&nbsp;– <em>Andrew Liszewski</em></p><p><h3>Best sequel<strong> </strong></h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338520/lg-stanbyme-2-portable-tv-carrying-strap-ces-2025">StanbyMe 2</a></h4></p><p>I’m really happy LG isn’t giving up on its quest to make a useful, quirky portable TV with its StanbyMe series. It’s a ridiculous name no doubt, but the new StanbyMe 2 is an update that deserves our entirely legitimate Best Sequel award. Instead of the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23554060/lg-stanbyme-monitor-tv-stand-features-specs-review">fixed TV on a lamp post</a>” design of the original model, it now lets you clutch a 27-inch screen under your arm like some super iPad Pro or attach a strap to hold it like a purse. It’s also technically a sequel to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24109258/lg-stanbyme-go-portable-suitcase-briefcase-tv-review">secret agent-style StanbyMe Go</a> but now lighter and with better battery life.</p><p>Although I haven’t carried one myself yet, I’d imagine it would be a lot like clutching an Apple Studio Display or classic 27-inch iMac with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22989517/apple-store-studio-display-interchangeable-stand-replacement-repair-service">their stands removed</a>. (I’ve carried many in my line of work.) The StanbyMe 2 would be great as a portable monitor for video games, a laptop, or Mac Mini, especially with the now-more-usable 2560 x 1440 resolution compared to the previous model’s 1080p. I was on the fence about buying LG’s previous iterations of this product, but I’m ready to strap this one on as soon as I can. <em>– Umar Shakir</em></p><p><h3>Best concept </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338956/dreame-robot-vacuum-legs-arm-tools">Dreame concept robovac</a></h4></p><p>It finally happened. Robot vacuums have limbs. Roborock and Dreame both showed off vacuums with appendages at CES 2025: Roborock debuted its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24332998/roborock-saros-z70-robot-vacuum-omnigrip-arm">Saros Z70</a> with an arm to pick up socks, and Dreame added legs to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337114/dreame-x50-ultra-robot-vacuum-climb-steps-legs-price-ces">X50 Ultra</a> to climb a small step. But it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338956/dreame-robot-vacuum-legs-arm-tools">Dreame’s concept bot</a> that put the pieces together.&nbsp;</p><p>The company’s next innovation is a robot that features legs <em>and</em> an arm. It also has a separate toolbox, and the company says the robot will be able to select various brushes from it and attach them to its arm to get into your dusty corners. </p><p>I love the innovation we’re seeing as robot vacuums seek to clean every inch of your home, but am I also slightly terrified? Yes. Yes, I am.&nbsp; <em>– Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</em></p><p><h3>Best in show</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24337633/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-flexible-oled-price-specs">Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a></h4></p><p>There was really only one gadget at CES that everyone had to see, and that’s Lenovo’s rollable laptop, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24337633/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-flexible-oled-price-specs">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a>. Yes, we may have first seen it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/26/23615842/lenovo-rollable-laptop-smartphone-prototype-concept">in concept form</a> a while back, but this is now a real product you’ll be able to see in a store and buy this year. The only thing better than a wild proof-of-concept at a show like CES is when a wild future-tech idea becomes our reality in the present.</p><p>Now, it’ll cost $3,499 when it launches in June, so it’s not likely many people will buy it. But picture this future: you sit down to do some work, you open up your laptop with a nice-looking OLED display, and then you hit a button to summon <em>more</em> <em>laptop</em> — as the kinda-square-ish 14-inch display climbs higher into a 16.7-inch tall boy of a screen. That’s not something that happens in the real world, but it will once this laptop comes out.</p><p>And of course, the tech has many caveats and drawbacks to go with it: it’s expensive, it’s potentially fragile, there’s bound to be software jank with Windows, and just look at those creases. But it’s also got the upside of being, well, <em>cool</em>. – <em>Antonio G. Di Benedetto</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s even a mod that turns Jeff the Land Shark into Pochita from Chainsaw Man.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/mr-1736510188657.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Vegeta as Iron Man mod for Marvel Rivals has been downloaded over 60,000 times. Image credit: Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Using mods violates Marvel Rivals’ terms of use, and developer NetEase itself has warned players against modifying game files. Despite the risk of getting banned, Marvel Rivals mods remain hugely popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now. Players are reporting the Season 1 update has added asset hash checking, which in turn has disabled mods. The official Marvel Rivals Discord is starting to fill up with questions from bemused players who are asking why their mods aren’t working, and social media is now bubbling up the explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase told IGN: "It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have suggested mod makers may be able to issue workarounds for their creations, but as it stands Marvel Rivals is a mod-free game. And the crackdown perhaps comes as little surprise. NetEase generates revenue from the free-to-play hero shooter through the sale of premium skins. If modding threatens that revenue in any way, NetEase will have taken a dim view.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve seen a similar crackdown from other developers who sell premium skins for their games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-bans-mods-from-public-servers-says-official-mod-tools-are-coming">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment at one point disabled mods for the game</a>, although later reversed its decision.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo has finally acknowledged the slew of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks that have been hitting the internet.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s acknowledgment came following this week’s CES event in Las Vegas, where accessory manufacturer Genki revealed Nintendo’s Switch 2 models. Genki has revealed since the leaks that the images were created based on leaked information and not on seeing Switch 2.</p>



<p>However, the leaks have seemingly struck a nerve with Nintendo, who have acknowledged them in a rare occurrence. Speaking with Japanese website <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>, Nintendo said that “these images and videos are not official.”</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, however, has quickly become one of the biggest open secrets in the entire industry, with almost everything to do with the console, including accessories, logos, specifications, and more leaking online.</p>



<p>As for when Nintendo will reveal the Nintendo Switch 2, it remains to be seen, but the sheer amount of leaks surrounding the console should indicate that it will be sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Regardless of its reveal and impending release, Nintendo will be hoping that the Switch’s successor is as successful as the original, which has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In comparison to other Nintendo consoles, the Wii U has sold 13.56 million units, the Wii has sold 101.63 million units, the DS with 154.02 million, the Game Boy Advance has sold 81.51 million units, the Game Boy has sold 118.69 million units, the GameCube sold 21.74 million units, Nintendo 64 sold 32.93 million units, the SNES sold 49.10 million units and the NES sold 61.91 million units.</p>



<p>What do you think about all of the information surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There's good news for those wanting to try The First Berserker: Khazan before they buy - a free demo is on the way.</p>
<p>From 16th January, a slice of Khazan will be playable on PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. With no expiry date, it'll be available for anyone looking to give it a go even after the game launches on 27th March 2025.</p>

			<p>Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Songs of Silence - Story Trailer | OUT NOW! | Art Nouveau-inspired Fantasy Strategy Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5TFGFsCR60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Songs of Silence initially offers a series of Campaign missions that explore the conflict between Primordials and Celestials, with humanity caught between the two. These two forces pulled the world apart, leaving one of light and one of darkness, and while this initially led to a period of peace and enlightenment, it soon dissolved into bitter war. Humanity thought itself blessed by the Celestials, but now, under the incoming pestilence of Silence, the remaining humans struggle to survive.</p>


<p>You take on the role of Lorelai, the newly crowned queen of Ehrengard. Her kingdom has already fallen to Silence, and she traipses across the land with her remaining subjects in search of a new home. It’s not easily won though, and instead all she finds is more conflict and in-fighting between the nobles of the neighbouring kingdoms, before she then suffers a bitter betrayal.</p>
<p>It sets the scene for an intriguing fantasy tale, and one that doesn’t simply go for a gung-ho, binary vision of good and evil. It instead gives you a measured, often brutal depiction of war, and those who are worst affected by it. It’s then dressed up with excellent voice work and some of the most impressive character art you’ve ever seen in gaming, making it a genuine pleasure to take in.</p>


<p>Things start out in familiar fashion for the turn-based 4X genre. You move across the over-world map with a limited movement range, and you can enter into combat with any enemies within that. Once combat begins though, you soon discover that Songs of Silence is doing things differently. Battles are fundamentally skirmishes, with your army limited to a set number of units, though these can be buffed up by militia and other reserve units if you’re garrisoned in a location.</p>
<p>You choose your army’s starting positioning, but once you enter combat you don’t have direct control over the majority of your units, each one automatically attacking the nearest enemy in the vein of an auto-battler. What you do have is your deck of actions, with each of your army’s commanders having their own selection of cards to choose from. Each card provides a special ability or attack to help you on the way to victory. Initially, that’s a charge command, sending your mounted units plunging into the enemy ranks, while later cards see you calling winged creatures from the sky down upon them, or causing units to explode upon death.</p>

<p>While your units remain at the same level – it’s a shame not to be able to level up those who’ve been with you through many battles – each commander gains XP and levels up, growing your army and giving you a selection of new cards or the chance to upgrade an existing one. It means that your commander steadily grows in your chosen direction, letting you customise and tailor the abilities and attacks you prefer.</p>
<p>At first, it feels as though battles are short and easily won, but you soon discover that it’s crucial to choose the correct units, and that you’re not woefully underprepared, as Songs of Silence will merrily knock you on your beautifully drawn ass time and time again. You can exchange units between your commanders, and at times you need to make a last-ditch attempt at success by pooling your remaining units together for one final battle.</p>
<p>Songs of Silence makes battles feel hard-won, even though you don’t have full control of your army. You’ll still be there, nervously glancing at your ability cooldowns while trying to protect or resurrect a crucial unit in time. It feels rewarding and focussed, and I love that it’s doing things differently. It’s a real success.</p>
<p>Where Songs of Silence occasionally falls down is the way you select and interact with your units, and on console I was forever selecting the wrong thing, or accidentally moving a unit when I meant to choose another one. I had to tell myself which button to press consciously, and it creates a disconnect between you and the game. It could, of course, just be a personal fumble, but there’s something just that little bit off to the way it fits together here. I’d occasionally move a unit into the safety of a city, only to accidentally move them out again, using up the last of my movement, and stranding them in front of some incoming enemy units. Fortunately, it never ruined my chances, but it is an unnecessary frustration.</p>

<p>The Campaign can also fall into the trap of relying on pure power, and the way you acquire that is through repeated grinding and capturing enough locations to ensure you’ve got a steady stream of resources. It’s little different from how other strategy games function, but sometimes it feels more drawn out than it should be.</p>
<p>This is where Skirmishes come in. These battles allow you to generate random maps and go up against up to five AI-controlled enemies with a series of Fates that alter the gameplay in some way. At first, there won’t be a great deal here, but as you complete Campaign missions you unlock new characters, and additional Fates to switch things up. It’s a never-ending supply of action, and the underlying mechanics shine through when divorced from any narrative drive. Multiplayer against human opponents is identical, though I should note that there aren’t a whole lot of people playing online these days. You can offset that by joining the game’s Discord and finding like-minded players, which is what Songs of Silence points you to do. It’s well worth the extra effort.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a wonderful additional layer alongside the artistic visual flair, which is little surprise when it comes from Hitoshi Sakimoto, composer of Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy 12 and one of my personal favourites, Valkyria Chronicles. It brings drama and emotion to every encounter, with sweeping orchestral moments ensuring that you’re uplifted at just the right time, before plunging into the darkness and danger that lurks at various points.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could support more than regular NVIDIA DLSS, as a recently filed patent outlines some brand-new tech that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">Digital Foundry</a> went through the 39 pages of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">patent</a> filed on December 31st, 2024, highlighting some interesting findings that go beyond the description of a standard NVIDIA DLSS-style upscaling. One of the most interesting findings is the confirmation that the upscaling method described in the patent, which is usually expensive in terms of compute power and bandwidth, is specifically targeted to be executed within the 120th or 160th of a second on a low-power chip, so it's most definitely not the usual DLSS seen in the PC desktop space.</p>
<p>Another equally interesting finding discovered in the Nintendo Switch 2 AI-upscaling patent is the description of something that could be labeled as dynamic AI-upscaling. According to this description, the model based upon real-time data coming from the game engine can be switched out in real-time or prepared ahead of time programmatically to use lower quality upscaling<br>
to fit within a certain frame time budget. Essentially, if the game is sending out an image that exceeds 16.6 milliseconds or 33.3 milliseconds, the device will use a lower-quality upscaling model to output the final 1080p image. This is obviously new tech that was never seen before in action and that may have been developed specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2, as something like this may not be needed in the PC desktop space unless for very low-power laptops, for example.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 patent is very broad, and describes all sorts of applications for AI-powered upscaling, such as neural decompression that could be used to bring file sizes down, and even cloud upscaling, going over various possibilities such as upscaling being done on the cloud and then sent via a stream to a local device, the upscaling getting done on the local device and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo's Switch 2 Upscaling Patent Explained: More Than Just DLSS?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4R1p1LjHME8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While AI-powered upscaling can do wonders, as shown over the past few years by NVIDIA DLSS, developers still need to get their games running decently on the Nintendo Switch 2, which could be a challenge considering the system won't be as powerful as any of the other current generation systems. According to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-and-speculation-ot-cmon-nintendo-announce-this-thing-already-up-dev-unit-leaked-partly-see-threadmarks.1077882/page-23#post-134076051">rumors</a> circulating online, there is a "movement" to try and get scaled-down Xbox Series S versions of games on the system, although it is not yet known if this has been successful so far, and with leaks having focused only on the hardware side of things, we will likely have to wait for the official reveal to see how multiplatform games will run on the system.</p>
<p>Speaking about leaks, Nintendo has finally acknowledged them in some way.&nbsp;<span>In a statement issued to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, the company said that the images and videos making the rounds are "not official."</span>&nbsp;What's interesting to note is that the company didn't say they are not accurate, so there's a solid chance we already got the first look at the system via all these leaks that have come in daily.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but at this point, it should only be a matter of days until we finally see what the Japanese company has in store for the future.</p>
