Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners—plagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair—pool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape.</p><p><strong>Escape the Monastery</strong></p><p>Escaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Explore your surroundings and combine the characters’ abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you’re caught being somewhere you shouldn’t be, the guards will not be kind.</p><p><strong><a title="Series > Mana [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge the Madness</strong></p><p>To effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters’ mental health.</p><p>Each playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character’s sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_908846"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Discover the Secrets Within</strong></p><p>Choose from two different escape plans to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises.</p><p>Time is continuous in <em>The Stone of Madness</em>. <a title="Genres > Action [2,105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>s have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions.</p><p>Sneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters’ sanity.</p><p>Nighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about. But sometimes, the risk is worth the reward.</p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a Stunning Hand-Painted Art Style</strong></p><p>The visuals in <em>The Stone of Madness</em> have been lovingly hand-painted and animated frame by frame, drawing heavy inspiration from 18th century artist Francisco De Goya.</p><p>The game’s isometric perspective acts as the perfect showcase for the eye-catching visuals, allowing players to observe every minute detail and feel as if they’re adventuring through a Goya painting brought to life.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

<p>Bethesda's <em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em> is the latest game from a Microsoft subsidiary that will make its way to the PlayStation 5. The game will hit Sony's console in the spring of 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/the-great-circle-is-indiana-jones-for-a-post-uncharted-world/">announced yesterday</a>, months after a planned December launch on Xbox Series S/X and Windows.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_o61DN93ik">an interview with YouTube channel Xbox On</a>, Microsoft's Phil Spencer expanded on that decision, implying that multiplatform releases for Microsoft gaming properties were important to the Xbox division's bottom line. "We run a business," he said, "It's definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery that we have to give back to the company, because we get a level of support from the company that's just amazing in what we're able to go do."</p>

<p>Amid massive layoffs that have hit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/report-embracers-ongoing-layoffs-kill-a-new-deus-ex-game-after-2-years-work/">other</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/unity-cuts-25-percent-of-workforce-as-it-refocuses-on-game-engine-business/">gaming companies</a> in recent months, Spencer noted that there's "a lot of pressure on the [game] industry" these days. "[The industry] has been growing for a long, long time and now people are looking for ways to grow," he said. "And I think that us, as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there's going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed [ars] going to change... for all of us."</p>
<h2>“It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us”</h2>
<p>Although Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">released four former Xbox exclusives on other platforms</a> months ago, Spencer suggested that there hasn't been any commensurate dip in total Xbox usage. "What I see when I look is our franchises are getting stronger; our Xbox console players are as high this year as they've ever been," he said.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"So I look at it, and I say, 'Okay, our player numbers are going up for the console platform, our franchises are as strong as they've ever been... So I look at this [as] 'How can we make our games as strong as possible?'" our platform continues to grow both on console on PC and on cloud and I think it's just going to be a strategy that works for us."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xboxmulti.jpg" data-height="864" data-width="1536" alt="Microsoft's last four multiplatform game releases were a bit smaller than <em>Indiana Jones</em>."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xboxmulti.jpg" data-height="864" data-width="1536">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Microsoft's last four multiplatform game releases were a bit smaller than <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p><p>Microsoft</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/xbox-chief-we-want-to-regain-trust-more-than-we-want-to-beat-sony/">long prioritized maintaining a healthy number of overall Xbox players</a> over selling more raw consoles than competitors like Sony. Still, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">continuing cratering of sales revenue from Xbox hardware</a> likely contributes heavily to Microsoft's decision to release its games on competing platforms.
</p><p>A big-budget, big-name Bethesda release like <em>Indiana Jones</em> could act as more of an Xbox system seller than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">the four older, smaller games</a> that Microsoft recently let go multiplatform. Then again, <em>The Great Circle</em>'s multiple months of Xbox exclusivity—which include the 2024 holiday buying season—could still provide a bit of a relative advantage for Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em>'s PS5 availability may come as a particular surprise to readers who remember Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">saying in February</a> that neither <em>The Great Circle</em> nor <em>Starfield</em> were a part of the company's current multiplatform plans. But a careful parsing of Spencer's words at the time shows that he only promised those titles were not among the four multiplatform titles they were announcing at that time.
</p><p>Back then, Spencer said that those four multiplatform releases didn't represent "a change to our fundamental exclusive strategy." But he added that there was a desire to "use what some of the other platforms have right now to help grow our franchises" to help "the long-term health of Xbox."</p>
<p>"[I have] a fundamental belief that over the next five or ten years... games that are exclusive to one piece of hardware are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the game industry," Spencer said in February.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been a while since a known gamer frequented The White House. The first, and last, to do so was former President Barack Obama, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-01-08-the-first-wii-obama-brings-video-games-to-the-white-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>brought a Nintendo Wii</u></a> with him when he took office and, according to someone who played against him, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-president-barack-obama-is-a-captain-falcon-main-in-smash-bros"><u>apparently mains Captain Falcon in Super Smash Bros</u></a>. But depending on the outcome of the 2024 election, The White House may soon have a second gamer milling around: current Minnesota governor and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz.</p><p>But Gov. Walz isn’t bringing a Nintendo Wii with him (that we know of), nor has he attempted to settle his political disputes in Smash to our knowledge. His gaming habits are, surprisingly, a bit deeper a cut than that. It turns out that Gov. Walz is reportedly a fan of the Sega Dreamcast. And through some sleuthing, we’ve managed to not only track down Walz’s old Dreamcast console, but we may have also uncovered at least one game that the former teacher-turned-politician has historically enjoyed: Crazy Taxi.</p><h2>Little Dreamcast, Big Adventure</h2><p>We first learned that Gov. Walz was, at one point, a Dreamcast enjoyer due to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/tim-walz-coach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>article in The New York Times</u></a>. In the report, a former student of Walz’s recalls that he used to share “unusually relatable” stories with his classes, “like the time his wife had seized his Dreamcast, the Sega video game console, because he had been playing to excess.”</p><p>Obviously, this immediately sparked a flurry of community memes speculating what game had Walz so enraptured. Was it Sega Bass Fishing, a quintessential “dad” game that seemed in keeping with Gov. Walz’s overall demeanor? Was it Sega Sports NFL 2K, an apropos choice given he was a football coach and then-Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss was on the cover? Was it something more left-field like Shenmue or Skies of Arcadia? Theories abounded. We, and probably a number of other journalists, reached out to Gov. Walz’s office weeks ago looking for the answer, but didn’t get any response.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I get a little kick out of knowing our future VP might know who Big the Cat is.</p></div><p>That would have been the end of it, but for one member of gaming forum ResetEra. The user, Bryn Tanner (who goes by Aaron on the forum), had <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/us-poliera-ot12-the-moscow-project.79540/page-108#post-14807787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted way back in 2018</u></a> that they were in possession of Gov. Walz’s old Dreamcast. “Oh I bought a Dreamcast for $25 back in 2012 from one of his former high school students who worked on his campaign. Walz was just like ‘hey we have this old video game thing, do you want it?’ And the guy took it.”</p><p>When I reached out to him, Tanner was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/us-politics-ot-3-walzing-into-the-future.947364/page-103#post-126973017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>taking a well-deserved and humorous victory lap</u></a> as news about the Dreamcast surfaced. “lmao yes I still have that Dreamcast this fucking rules,” he wrote in a post following the NYT piece. Tanner went on to tell me that while the Dreamcast he purchased at the time came with a VMU, a third-party rumble pack, two controllers, and a controller extension cable, the VMU didn't have any data on it. And the console did not come with any games, though Tanner bought a copy of Crazy Taxi for $4 at Pawn America later on the day of the purchase.</p><p>“I get a little kick out of knowing our future VP might know who Big the Cat is if he ever played Sonic Adventure,” Tanner tells me.</p><p>Though Tanner didn’t know what games Walz played, he did know someone who might. He referred me to Alex Gaterud, one of Walz’s former Global Geography students at Mankato West. Though Gaterud doesn’t remember Walz ever speaking with him about video games, he was roommates in college with another Mankato graduate who brought along the Dreamcast in question and left it behind when he moved out. Gaterud then says he sold the Dreamcast to Tanner, though he points out to me that "advertising something ‘formerly owned by a U.S. Congressman’ doesn't add any value on Craigslist.”</p><p>What games came with the Dreamcast? Gaterud doesn’t know - there weren’t any around when he handed it off to Tanner, and he can’t recall ever playing anything on it. Fortunately, Gaterud was able to connect me to one more person who might be able to sort this out once and for all. So I called up Tom Johnson, another Mankato West graduate and a former campaign intern for Gov. Walz.</p><h2>Tim Walz and the Nerd Herd</h2><p>Tom Johnson graduated Mankato West in 2007, and spent the summer before he went to college working for Walz’s congressional campaign. As an intern, he would send out mailers, coordinate volunteers, and drive around Minnesota, occasionally with Walz along for the ride. </p><p>Given that it wasn’t an election year, Johnson says the vibes were fairly relaxed and quiet, and the campaign office had a break area in the back with a mini putt set, a couch, and a TV. One day, he recalls, Walz brought in a box of stuff that he had planned to donate, saying he thought the staff might like to use it. Inside, of course, was the Dreamcast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Johnson and the other staff didn’t play the Dreamcast much during its stint in the campaign office, so when he left for college, Johnson just took it with him, which is how it reached Gaterud and later Tanner. But while Johnson wasn’t doing much Dreamcast gaming, he tells me that in high school he was a part of a group of individuals known (“affectionately, I hope”) as the “Nerd Herd” at Mankato West. The group would have LAN parties together, and play World of Warcraft late into the night. Many Nerd Herd members, Johnson says, went on to work on Walz’s campaign for Congress in 2006. “I would say the Nerd Herd of Mankato contributed greatly to [Walz’s] election to Congress in 2006, which had the domino effect of him being nominated for vice president of the United States.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/img-0719-1724268368202.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Gov. Tim Walz with several members of the "Nerd Herd." Photo credit: Tom Johnson</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Walz really is just such a great, normal guy,” Johnson continues. “He’s one of those guys, it’s like, he’s your friendly neighbor, and then you find out that guy has the Guiness Book of World Records for free throw shooting. He’s just a normal guy, he just happens to be a governor too. Everything people say about him being this down to earth guy, really nice, really friendly, really earnest, it’s all true.”</p><p>But what video games does he play? Johnson thinks he remembers one disc sitting inside the Dreamcast when he took it from the office to go to college.</p><p>“I wanna say there was Crazy Taxi,” Johnson says.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Is Crazy Taxi the game Gov. and VP candidate Tim Walz played so much that his wife took his Dreamcast away? We still don’t know for sure. It is, as Gaterud put it to me, “basically law that all Dreamcasts need a copy of Crazy Taxi,” so at minimum, Gov. Walz almost certainly owned a copy. And in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brynjtanner/video/7401650958280723743?_r=1&amp;_t=8p3wZPih1LC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a TikTok video posted by Tanner about the Dreamcast</a>, one commenter seems to imply they at one point knew Walz, and that he talked about Crazy Taxi a lot - we've reached out to them for more details. I’ve also reached out to his office again to see if he’ll confirm, but nothing so far. And I reached out to Sega for comment on the possibility that their goofy driving franchise played a tiny role in the current presidential election. No comment there either.</p><p>Whatever the case, Gov. Walz’s however-brief flirtation with the Dreamcast would make him the first known gamer vice president if he and current vice president Kamala Harris are elected. Given that Crazy Taxi is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crazy-taxi-reboot-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-sega-says"><u>apparently getting an open-world reboot</u></a>, maybe we’ll see it make an appearance in the White House one of these days.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s a video that confirmed a release date of December 9, 2024, for PC and Xbox Series X | S, while also revealing that PlayStation 5 players will be able to join in on the adventure next spring. In between shots of Indiana punching nazis and solving ancient puzzles, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/tylerllewtaing/status/1825989356462498094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tylerllewtaing</a> noticed that the footage briefly namedrops the location featured in Disneyland’s Indiana Jones Adventure, the Temple of the Forbidden Eye.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Indy has visited all sorts of distant lands... <a href="https://t.co/Dc3Zr8nX3m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Dc3Zr8nX3m</a></p>— Bethesda (@bethesda) <a href="https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1826303376847425578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Disneyland’s Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye opened in the ‘90s and sees park attendees immerse themselves in the world of Harrison Ford’s legendary adventurer. It involves exploring abandoned areas, uncovering long-forgotten treasures, and coming face to face with powerful, magical forces. It’s a Pirates of the Caribbean-style ride that has guests tag along on a classic Indy adventure, and it’ll be mentioned, at least in some form, in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p>Bethesda did officially acknowledge the cute reference, though it’s unclear if players will actually be able to visit or interact with the temple in-game in any way. While MachineGames hasn't gone as far as to outright confirm the extent to which the Temple of the Forbidden Eye is included, fans were quick to speculate and hope for a full-on tie-in.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Brian Saeger (@SkywalkerBrian) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkywalkerBrian/status/1826063301580579319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there’s an entire segment that’s the Temple of the Forbidden Eye, I will literally pass out.

                <p>When it comes to survival-horror, Resident Evil is the undisputed king of that genre. If you're looking to replay this beloved franchise or check it out for the first time, the new <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fresident-evil-decades-horror-village-gold&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-resident-evil-decades-of-horror-2024%2F1100-6526009%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil Decades of Horror Humble Bundle</a></strong> is certainly worth checking out. From now until September 11, horror fans can get 11 Resident Evil games, including every mainline entry, for only $30.</p><p>You'd normally pay almost $300 for all of these games, but this bundle deal offers a terrific discount and a portion of your purchase will be donated to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Breakthrough TD, two wonderful organizations helping children across the United States and Canada.</p><h2>Humble Bundle Resident Evil Decades of Horror</h2><p><em>Pay at least $30 to get the following games (Steam keys):</em></p><ul><li>Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster</li><li>Resident Evil</li><li>Resident Evil 2 (remake)</li><li>Resident Evil 3 (remake)</li><li>Resident Evil 4 (original)</li><li>Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition</li><li>Resident Evil 6 Complete</li><li>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</li><li>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</li><li>Resident Evil Revelations</li><li>Resident Evil Revelations 2 Deluxe Edition</li></ul><p>If you already own some of those Resident Evil titles, there are three lower tiers to choose from, too. For only $3, you'll get the original Resident Evil and both Resident Evil Revelations games. The $10 tier adds Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil 4 through 6. Lastly, there's a $20 tier that comes with every game in bundle <em>except </em>for Resident Evil Village.</p><p><strong>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition </strong>still has a list price of $50 on Steam, so finding it in a bundle like this is pretty awesome. A direct sequel to <strong>Resident Evil 7</strong>, which kicked off a new golden age for the franchise, protagonist Ethan Winters ventures to a secluded Eastern-European village to face a new breed of horror. This was also the game that made the Internet lose its collective mind for Lady Dimetrescu, a <em>very tall </em>antagonist in the game. The Gold Edition of Village comes with multiple DLC add-ons, including the Winters' story expansion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4354825-residentevilvillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4354825-residentevilvillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354825"></a><figcaption>Resident Evil Village</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4354825-residentevilvillage.jpg"></figure><p>You'll definitely want to play Resident Evil 7 before Village to understand the story. A return to form for the franchise, RE7 shifted the series to first-person gameplay, and offered an isolating atmosphere within a more confined space, which amplified the frights. An incredibly creepy cast of antagonists also helped pave the way for the franchise's current renaissance.</p><p>Kicking things off with <strong>Resident Evil 0</strong>, the HD Remaster on offer here is a prequel to the first game in the series and follows police officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen as they get mixed up in Umbrella's nasty business.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4354500-resident-evil-3-remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354500" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4354500-resident-evil-3-remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354500"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4354500-resident-evil-3-remake.jpg"></figure><p>The original <strong>Resident Evil</strong> is quaint by today's standards, but it's still a rock-solid game with a spooky atmosphere and memes that have stood the test of time. Things take a dramatic leap forward once you get to <strong>Resident Evil 2 and 3</strong>, as this bundle is offering the gorgeously gory remakes of those games. These set a new benchmark for the series, as they retained the core DNA of the original games and enhanced them with new features, more effective terror, and modern-day graphics to hammer home the horror of being trapped in a city full of flesh-eating zombies.</p><p>While you're not getting the remake of <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong>, the original version is still a ton of fun to play. This was where the franchise ventured into survival-action territory, and you can grab a free mod online to spruce up the GameCube-era visuals on your PC. Moving into the modern era, <strong>Resident Evil 5</strong> added even more action the franchise formula--this time with co-op--it's still a blast to play as you work your way through infected villages, ancient tombs, and Umbrella's most dangerous bioweapon experiments.</p><p><strong>Resident Evil 6</strong> is largely considered to be the black sheep of the series, as it veered further from its roots and went all-in on spectacle. It's not a total disaster, and it certainly has moments of brilliance, but you'll have to work to find those highlights. Resident Evil 7 felt like a return to form for the franchise when it first came out, as its smaller focus, shift to first-person gameplay, and an incredibly creepy cast of antagonists paved the way for Resident Evil's current Renaissance.</p><p><span>Outside of the mainline entries, you're also getting both </span><strong>Resident Evil Revelations</strong><span> games as well. These Resident Evils emphasized survival, evasion, and exploration, and were seen as being closer to the survival-horror origins of the series when compared to later entries.</span></p><h3>More Humble Bundles</h3><p>There's another great Capcom-flavored Humble Bundle on offer this month, and it's one that fighting game fans won't want to miss out on. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-bundle-capcom-summer-2024/1100-6525604/" data-ref-id="1100-6525604">Capcom Summer 2024 Humble Bundle</a> is a 12-game collection, comprised of several compilations of Capcom classics.

                <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is preparing to formally accept the Democratic party nomination for Vice President this week at the Democratic National Convention. And just before that happens, we may have learned more about his classic gaming habits.</p><p>Following his selection as the running-mate for presumptive nominee Kamala Harris, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/tim-walz-coach.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profile in the New York Times</a> outed Walz as a Dreamcast fan. Players on the high school football team, where he coached, recalled him sharing stories that the kids found relatable, like when his wife took away his Dreamcast because he played it too much. Naturally this sparked speculation about what game had hooked him so deeply.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reports that it tracked down a series of subsequent owners of Walz's Dreamcast, tracing it back to a man named Tom Johnson. Johnson worked as an intern for Walz's congressional campaign, and one day Walz brought in a box of personal items he had planned to donate, but that the interns might like to use instead. Among them was a Dreamcast, which went mostly unused in the congressional office. Johnson ultimately took the Dreamcast with him to college and said that he recalls seeing a copy of Crazy Taxi already in the system when he took it.</p><p>As Johnson notes, Crazy Taxi was a common game for Dreamcast owners, so it may not have necessarily been Walz's favorite. But that it was sitting in the console suggests at least some level of affection for the driving game. And that's probably the most definitive answer we'll get on the matter--unless he happens to bring it up during his DNC speech. Given his jovial demeanor in other speeches, that's not outside the realm of possibility.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Andrew Harnik</em></p>

<p>Like many of you, I’m an absolute sucker for a fantastic video game collector’s edition. You know the type, complete with a statue that’ll collect dust on a shelf or desk somewhere. There’s one more to add to the collection in the coming months. Following its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gameplay-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom gameplay showcase</a>, Warhorse Studios unveiled its Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Collector’s Edition!</p>



<p>The Collector’s Edition for the upcoming medieval RPG is probably one of the most enticing I’ve checked out lately. It features:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gold Edition (Includes Expansion Pass)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Henry &amp; Pebbles Statue – 12 Inches</strong></li>



<li><strong>Alleys of Kuttenberg – Exclusive Cloth Map</strong></li>



<li><strong>Coats of Valor – Enamel Pin Set</strong></li>



<li><strong>The King’s Rebels – Collectible Card Set</strong></li>



<li><strong>Letter of Hope</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gallant Huntsman’s Kit – Digital Bonus</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s gorgeous and packaged in a unique case resembling a medieval chest, complete with a coat of arms on its front!</p>

<p>As of this writing, the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Collector’s Edition, though <a href="https://www.kingdomcomerpg.com/editions/collector-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it is listed</a> as “Pre-Order Now” with a note telling interested buyers to “check local retailers for availability,” doesn’t have any available retailers. I suspect Amazon, Best Buy, and GameStop will wind up on the list, but we’ll update you with more information once we know!</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s still time to score a copy of the Collector’s Edition, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 release date</a> is still a ways off!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-adds-mercenaries-and-the-dark-citadel/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The brand-new Spiritborn class received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-spiritborn-class-revealed-in-blizzard-livestream/">deep-dive livestream</a> about a month ago, during which the Diablo IV developers explored what makes it so unique. It has a ton of utility and variety, allowing players to play aggressively or defensively, depending on their preference. Diablo IV's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred is due to release on October 8, where players will be introduced to Neyrelle, a character who is on a vicious and gory path.</p>
<p>In addition to the Spiritborn class being added to Diablo IV, players will now experience the Mercenaries feature. This allows players to meet companions that can accompany them in battle. They can be customized to fit your play style and compliment your build in a way you see fit. Not only this, but the Mercenaries will all come with their backstory and skill trees that you can get lost in to make them more supportive or aggressive, depending on how you choose to play in the expansion. To utilize Mercenaries, they are listed as reinforcements, which can then periodically join you in battle to perform attacks to help you clear out mobs.</p>
<p>There are four Mercenaries you can choose from, all hailing from different parts of Sanctuary. Below is what you can expect from each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raheir</strong> - Born on the streets of Gea Kul, they were trained by the Iron Wolves.</li>
<li><strong>Varyana</strong> - Former cannibal who left her tribe and became a butcher by trade turned mercenary.</li>
<li><strong>Aldkin</strong> - Half-child, half-demon creature born half-demonic due to the First Khazra from the Citadel performing dark rituals on his mother.</li>
<li><strong>Subo</strong> - A disgraced archer from the mountains, shunned by the people who turned to him for aid, and has now become a bounty hunter for hire.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you explore the world alongside your Mercenaries, they can gain rapport with you, allowing you to unlock rewards and bartering currency. As you increase your rapport levels with your chosen mercenary, you can barter with them to get a chance to snag some powerful loot that may benefit your character in the long run.</p>
<p>One of the other new features added in this expansion for Diablo IV is The Dark Citadel. This is PvE content made for the end-game, where players participate in multiplayer combat in a dungeon-crawler to take down bosses they encounter. You can enter the Dark Citadel with up to four players to take down complicated bosses. If you are playing with them and don't have the option to communicate, you can utilize the brand-new marker system added to help develop some tactics.</p>
<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is receiving a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24128995/delve-deeper-into-nahantu-with-mercenaries-dark-citadel-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ton of new content</a> aside from just those two features, such as major progression updates and a new time-attack dungeon.</p>
<p>On August 29, excited Diablo fans will be able to get more information on what to expect from the upcoming expansion, where the developers detail changes to the Paragon system, difficulty tiers, and more.</p>
