            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-metroid-and-mario-prove-the-switch-is-far-from-dead<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I was told there was supposed to be a software drought while we waited for Switch 2. I was told to expect a handful of ports, remakes, and remasters sprinkled throughout the rest of 2024. I was told the Switch was dying.</p><p>Well, apparently no one told Nintendo. And if they did, Nintendo certainly wasn’t listening, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced"><u>today’s Nintendo Direct</u></a> was one of my favorites in years, with surprise announcements that will make the wait for Nintendo’s next console incredibly easy. Don’t unplug the dock from your entertainment center just yet, because the Switch still has plenty of juice left.</p><p>If you were completely removed from the video game news cycle and you watched the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, you’d probably think it was a presentation dropped somewhere during the peak of the console’s life cycle. Nintendo really brought out the big guns with new entries in its classic trio of franchises: Mario, Zelda, and Metroid. We got our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-revealed">first look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, a brand new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">mainline The Legend of Zelda game starring the eponymous princess</a> for the first time, and the long-awaited <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-opens-with-mario-luigi-brothership">return of the Mario &amp; Luigi series</a>, continuing the fairytale-like resurgence of Mario RPGs over the last year. Add on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-revealed-nintendo-direct-2024">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-announced-for-switch-at-june-2024-nintendo-direct">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, and Nintendo revealed four brand-new first-party games and one remaster, three of which will be out later this year.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Logan's Favorite Nintendo Direct Games (June 2024)</h3><p>My top ten favorite announcements from the Nintendo Direct on June 18, 2024. The top two will surprise no one!</p></div><p>I really appreciate Nintendo’s focus on concrete release dates in its Directs. The Xbox showcase this year was <em>awesome, </em>but we were left with a lot of “TBA” or generic “2025” dates. I’m super excited for games like Fable and Perfect Dark, and can’t wait to eventually get them, but it’s a lot easier to be more excited about a new Zelda game I didn’t know existed when I woke up this morning that will be in my hands exactly 100 days from now. </p><p>And The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom really looks like my dream game. Everything we know so far points to Nintendo taking the explorative, creative spirit of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and injecting it into the top-down Zelda formula. In today’s reveal trailer we see Zelda building a column of water and ascending to its surface, stacking beds to create a makeshift ladder, and running across treetops 2D Zelda has forever used as barriers for the player. Plus, this is a Zelda game without a sword, and it’s allowing the developers to truly go crazy with combat and puzzle possibilities. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Echoes of Wisdom looks like my dream game.</p><p>BotW/TotK's spirit in a top-down game.</p><p>Convention breaking! Zelda runs along treetops 2D Zelda has forever used as barriers.</p><p>I've wanted a Zelda game without a sword for years because I thought they'd go crazy with it... and they did! <a href="https://t.co/tElILFVtmn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/tElILFVtmn</a></p></div>— Logan Plant (@LoganJPlant) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganJPlant/status/1803140765981483264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Moving on from Zelda to Mario, the remakes of Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door already felt like small miracles, and it’s truly shocking that Nintendo is completing the trio by putting out a brand new Mario &amp; Luigi game this November. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is the first Mario &amp; Luigi game in nearly a decade, and it marks the franchise’s home console debut. After Mario &amp; Luigi developer AlphaDream sadly went bankrupt in 2019, it seemed like the series was dead, so it was a huge surprise to see this game kick off the Direct. We still don’t know who is developing Brothership (Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake"><u>frustratingly quiet about this</u></a>), but hopefully Nintendo brought on some of AlphaDream’s talent to continue the series.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn’t coming until sometime in 2025, but how great was it to finally see what it looks like now, over seven years since its original announcement? It certainly appears to be a faithful Metroid Prime game, complete with the iconic HUD, raindrop effects on Samus’ arm cannon, and the return of the detective-like scanning ability. As a huge Mario Party fan, I also loved seeing a brand new entry that seems to learn from the strides the series took in 2021’s Mario Party Superstars, with bigger boards, more minigames, and tons of characters to choose from. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first-party surprises were the stars of the show, but I have to give a shoutout to some of the great third-party games developers are still bringing to Switch. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-is-as-faithful-as-you-could-ask">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake looks gorgeous</a>, and it was a phenomenal surprise to learn that Dragon Quest I and II are getting the same treatment. And, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-revealed-remasters-two-spin-offs-nintendo-direct-2024">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a> is finally bringing the last unlocalized Ace Attorney game to the West, which I never dreamed would happen as a lifelong Ace Attorney fan.</p><p>My one main disappointment from this Direct is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Don’t get me wrong – I love Donkey Kong Country Returns, but I’ve already played it twice on both Wii and 3DS. Plus it’s easily the inferior Donkey Kong Country game compared to Tropical Freeze, which is already on Switch. I’m glad Nintendo hasn’t forgotten about Donkey Kong, but I’m still waiting for the first brand new Donkey Kong platformer since Tropical Freeze hit Wii U in 2014. </p><p>Still, that’s a minor quibble for a Direct that otherwise blew my expectations out of the water. And as someone who can’t stand leaker culture, I loved that none of Nintendo’s major first-party announcements got out beforehand. It gave the whole event a level of energy and mystery that was missing from some of the summer’s other big showcases, like when Sony’s big Astro Bot reveal was spoiled online days before the State of Play. Astro Bot looks incredible and I can’t wait to play it, but it takes some wind out of the sails of a big, exciting showcase when we know exactly what to expect.</p><p>The Switch has already established its reputation as one of the greatest Nintendo consoles of all time, and if the major first-party games revealed today turn out to be as good as they look, it will strengthen the argument that no other Nintendo software library can match Switch. Pulling out some of the most iconic franchises in gaming during the Switch’s eighth year on the market is quite the power move, and it puts an emphatic stamp on the most successful generation in Nintendo history. If the Switch is dying, this is one hell of a farewell tour.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Nintendo Direct June 2024 Games</h3><p>Every game featured in the Nintendo Direct on June 18, 2024.</p></div><p><em>Logan Plant is IGN's Database Manager, Playlist Editor, occasional news writer, and frequent Super Ninfriendo on Nintendo Voice Chat.

Not to mention some popular online multiplayer games that aren't supported on Steam Deck. The Legion Go also boasts fairly robust specs and an ergonomic design that makes the large handheld comfortable to hold.

Lenovo's proprietary Legion Space software serves as a console-like hub for your games from each launcher.</p><p>Similar to the Nintendo Switch, it has detachable controllers and a kickstand for tabletop mode. Each of the detachable controllers has a pair of back buttons and there's also a mouse scroll wheel. The right controller has a trackpad, too.</p><p>The Legion Go's battery life isn't great, as it only lasts upwards of a few hours on a full charge. Granted, handheld Windows PCs tend to lose their charge quickly in general. Though not ideal, the Legion Go does have a rapid charging feature that allows you to refuel to 70% in around 30 minutes.</p><p>It has a pair of USB-C 4.0 ports, a microSD card slot to expand your storage, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>Overall, the Legion Go is a well-rounded device--and if you're looking for a handheld with Windows that offers broader access to PC games than Steam Deck, it's certainly worth a look--especially if you really want a larger screen.</p></div>                      </div><p>It's worth mentioning that <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028407127445674%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flenovo-legion-go-pc-handheld-drops-to-best-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6520492%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy has a nice deal on the Asus ROG Ally</a></strong>, which is essentially an affordable, smaller alternative to the Lenovo Legion Go. Featuring a seven-inch screen, 1080p resolution, and Ryzen Z1 processor, it's a great option if you're working with a smaller budget, as right now the handheld is on sale for just $400 (down from $500).

It's significantly more expensive than the other Windows handhelds mentioned here, as it will be priced at $800 at launch.</p><p>As for the increasingly popular <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Deck</a>, the 512GB and 1TB OLED models are $549 and $649, respectively--putting it in a comparable price tier to the Legion Go. Remember that you'll need to do some tinkering to gain access to third-party platforms like the Epic Games Store, and though you can use cloud streaming for Game Pass on Steam Deck, a Windows handheld is the better option if you're looking for native Game Pass support and online multiplayer for some popular games such as Destiny 2.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-book-sale-june-2024-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off/1100-6524101/">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Book Box Sets At Target - Manga, Novels, Comic Omnibuses, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/">Astro Bot Preorders Are Live - The PS5 Exclusive Comes With An Adorable Bonus</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-sale-features-rarely-discounted-exclusives-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524025/">Nintendo Switch Game Sale Features Rarely Discounted Exclusives Ahead Of Summer Game Fest</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preorders-come-with-bonus-playable-fighters/1100-6520091/">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorders Come With Bonus Playable Fighters</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorders Are Live, Includes Doctor Robotnik's Journal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hit-anime-hells-paradise-is-coming-to-blu-ray-with-an-amazon-exclusive-limited-edition/1100-6523982/">The Hit Anime Hell's Paradise Is Coming To Blu-Ray With An Amazon-Exclusive Limited Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Following the sudden cancellation of Paradox Interactive's ambitious Sims-like Life by You, the company has confirmed it's closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic.
</p>
<p>
Paradox Tectonic - the 24-person team overseen by former Sims boss and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs, Rod Humble - was unveiled with some fanfare back in 2019. It wasn't last March, however, that its first game, Life By You, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">officially revealed</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the time, it seemed like a solid proposition, promising Sims-like gameplay and ambitious features including an "open game world where everything is customisable" and "real language conversation". Unfortunately, the project quickly ran into trouble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">missing its original September 2023 early access launch</a> before getting hit with a succession of further delays.

<p>
And then, after announcing an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-delays-sims-like-life-by-you-again-but-wont-commit-to-a-new-release-date">indefinite delay</a> for Life By You back in March, Paradox finally pulled the plug earlier this week, calling the project, a "clear failure... to meet both our own and the community's expectations." And with the project dead, the studio behind it has, perhaps inevitably, followed suit.
</p>
<p>
News of Paradox Tectonic's closure was shared in a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic">statement from Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester</a> on the company's website. "This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who've worked hard on Life by You's Early Access release," Wester wrote. "Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre."
</p>
<p>
Paradox's decision does, unfortunately, mean another round of job losses in what's been already devastating year for the games industry. Since the start of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 workers</a> have already lost their jobs across companies including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studio-deviation-games-has-closed-down">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-is-reportedly-set-to-close-roll7-and-intercept-and-sell-off-private-division">Take-Two</a> - that's more layoffs than the industry faced throughout the whole of an already grim 2023.
</p>
<p>
As for Paradox, Life By You's cancellation is just the latest in a string of high-profile disasters for the publisher - including the troubled development of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of 2023's The Lamplighters' League (resulting in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">split with developer Harebrained Schemes</a>), and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">catastrophically premature</a> launch of Cities: Skylines 2 last October. Fan confidence in Paradox's upcoming - and repeatedly delayed - Prison Architect 2 has also taken a hit following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">part ways with long-running series developer Double Eleven</a> ahead of its release, suggesting its troubles might not yet be over.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alofts-clever-cozy-survival-mechanics-impress-in-latest-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Positive vibes abound in this incredibly deep survival crafting game.</h2></div><section><p>With a focus on ecological restoration and a cool approach to exploration and crafting, Aloft shows a lot of promise as a feel-good survival-crafting game. This cozy take on the genre encourages players to glide between floating islands in the sky and fight corruption to restore their ecosystems while discovering the ruins of an ancient civilization. Notably, its first-person town-building and crafting systems seemed exceptionally deep based on my hands-off demo of the game.</p><p>In just half an hour, one of Aloft’s developers walked me through the beginning of the game and showed me in-depth tutorials for its myriad systems; so many that I’m glad I went hands-off to watch an expert at work. Nearly everything I saw seemed clever and engaging at the very least and was always framed around Aloft’s core conceit of creating a survival game with a positive, restorative message and vibe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Aloft screenshots [2024]</h3></div></output><p>Off the bat, Aloft’s setup is immediately cool: you start out on a floating island in the sky with nothing. As you work your way through the starting area, you'll eventually get a glider (think somewhere between Avatar: The Last Airbender and Breath of the Wild), and take flight to another island. Zooming from island to island looked really freeing, and developer Astrolabe Interactive made a point to incorporate systems to keep it engaging and interesting rather than just a hollow jump from one floating rock to another.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Aloft’s momentum systems fuel a lot of its moving parts. It's crucial for successfully navigating the sky.</p></div><p>Aloft’s momentum systems fuel a lot of its moving parts. It's crucial for successfully navigating the sky, and certain environmental bits like updrafts can help you gain some extra momentum—and height—as you make your way to the next island. Once you build enough momentum and land on another island, you might find yourself in a corrupted ecosystem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Overrun with mushrooms and a dense, gray-brown fog, it's immediately clear that something's not right here. You can't even harvest or mine anything from these out-of-whack biomes until you stave off the fungal corruption. Based on what I've seen, this is the only place where Aloft has combat. Using timing-based real-time systems (kind of like active reload in Gears of War) to gain small bonuses to boost your attack rate, you'll fight off small waves of goblin-like mushrooms as you attack the root of the corruption.</p><p>Clearing these tree-like fungal structures from the biome will allow you to begin restoring it. Aloft more or less tells you exactly what you need to do to help bring it back to life, which will usually involve diversifying the flora on the island by planting new plants to help improve that microcosm’s sustainability. Once it's flourishing, you can finally harvest plants from the island and you might even chance upon a helpful critter like a sheep to help produce wool.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With the right materials, you can even pitch a sail on your island. All you need is a rudder, a wheel, and a few sails to catch the wind that's constantly blowing thanks to the massive hurricane at the heart of Aloft's map. Crafting in general might be the most interesting system Aloft has going for it, in fact – especially in how you unlock new recipes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Let's say you stumble on an abandoned house with some cool furniture you haven't seen. By drawing that piece of furniture, you've suddenly unlocked its crafting recipe for your own home.</p></div><p>The first is tied to the game’s story. Stumbling upon stone frescoes left by an ancient civilization will reveal new ideas to you, teaching you how to make stuff that's important to Aloft’s story and progression. This is going to be how you unlock critical pieces like the Glider Stand or the aforementioned rudders and sails.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Next is the more traditional route, which strikes the perfect balance between leaving it up to you as the player to discover a new recipe and showing you how to make it outright. Instead of just showing you everything you can craft with an item from the get-go, small indicators will tell you whether or not you've explored every possible combination of materials without explicitly saying what those combinations will make. This seems like the perfect balance of mystery and encouragement and plays well into Aloft’s overall sense of discovery and mystery.</p><p>The last crafting method might be the coolest thing I saw in the demo. You can fill out the empty pages of a notebook by drawing things you see in the world around you. Let's say you stumble on an abandoned house with some cool furniture you haven't seen. By drawing that piece of furniture, you've suddenly unlocked its crafting recipe for your own home.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Aloft - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Like a delicate ecosystem, seemingly every system in Aloft feeds into another. Momentum from gliding can affect combat, succeeding in combat can earn you helpful crafting materials, those crafting materials can then enable you to raise sails on your island and fly it into a storm to help water your crops. With so many systems at play, all coming together with impressive cohesion, it's hard to believe that Aloft is still in Early Access. I'm really interested to see how this interconnecting web of systems and ideas continues to evolve as the game expands beyond its current state.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix has been slowly revitalizing the SaGa series over the past few years, and the RPG franchise's next big release is Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven. The game is a ground-up remake of Romancing SaGa 2, which originally launched on the Super Famicom in 1993. An HD port of the original was also released in 2017, but this new remake version reimagines the game in full 3D and overhauls the battle system to match the new "timeline" system featured in recent titles like SaGa Emerald Beyond. There are also a few quality of life updates to make the game more approachable for new players, including new difficulty options.</p><p dir="ltr">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven launches on <strong>October 24</strong> for PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam, and preorders are available now. You can <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fromancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fromancing-saga-2-remake-preorder-guide-ps5-switch-pc%2F1100-6524385%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder a Steam key for $42.49 at Green Man Gaming with promo code JUNE15</a></strong>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4321024-sagapreorderbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321024" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4321024-sagapreorderbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321024"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4321024-sagapreorderbonus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you preorder Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, you'll get two bonus in-game items that boost your character's growth. These items will not be available in the base game at launch, so if you want them, you'll have to preorder.</p><p>While the series started as a Final Fantasy spin-off called Final Fantasy Legend, the SaGa series quickly evolved into its own unique franchise. Unlike many other JRPGs of the 90s, the SaGa games are notable for offering non-linear storylines and complex character building systems that were more akin to 90s computer RPGs. Romancing SaGa 2 sees players take the role of various members of a royal family as they fight to maintain their empire, and stave off world-ending threats. There's also an entire castle building mechanics where you construct and manage fortresses around your kingdom. Like other games in the series, where you go, who you talk to, and which side quests you complete can have drastic changes on how the story unfolds. It's a surprisingly open-ended experience, even by modern standards, and this new remake is the perfect opportunity to give it a go, or revisit it and try for an entirely different story path.</p><p dir="ltr">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven looks to be a great way to jump into the SaGa series, but plenty of other games in the series are available to buy now. The latest all-new release is SaGa: Emerald Beyond, but other titles like Romancing SaGa: Minstrel's Song Remastered, Collection of SaGa: Final Fantasy Legend, and more are also available and are worth checking out if you're curious about this cult-favorite JRPG series.

<p data-characters="341" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warframe</em> just dropped a new update, and with it, a ton of new items to farm away for and story beats to follow before the MMO’s big event later this summer. The <em>Jade Shadows</em> questline is the latest added in <em>Warframe</em>, and if you’re floundering with the new choices presented along the journey, we’ve got explainers to help. </p> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Stop here now for everything beyond will be spoilers related to the new quest involving the Stalker and Jade.</em></strong></p> <h2 id="h-should-you-name-the-baby-sirius-or-orion-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Should you name the baby Sirius or Orion in <em>Warframe</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">After being spared by the overwhelming barrage of shots, the Stalker escapes, with his child in his arms. Not yet named, you, the player, are now tasked with naming the child. So, do you name them Sirius or Orion?</p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><strong>Picking Sirius</strong> would mean that the baby will take more after its mother. Since she has passed, it would be a nod to her legacy. You’ll notice if you hover over the name and see the green, obviously referring to the energy colors of Jade.</p>
 <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false"><strong>Picking Orion</strong> would imply that the baby will take more after the Stalker (now known as Sorren). The vibes are more dark, with a darker shade of red showing what is associated with the name.</p> <figure data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-is-there-a-difference-between-sirius-and-orion" data-injectable="false">Is there a difference between Sirius and Orion?</h2> <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">There won’t be any major differences if you choose Sirius or Orion as the name for the child in <em>Warframe</em>. All choices made like this in the game<em> </em>only make the experience spiritually different, but the outcome will always be the same.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">This is similar to the whole Sun and Moon system when making pivotal choices in the mainline quests. Usually, the Sun option means to take the more noble and morally correct paths. Moon leans more towards a darker, brutal path. There are occasionally neutral paths, so you have a balance between the two.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">In the case of Sirius and Orion, it’s one side or the other. Where this will lead to in the future is still to be known. What kind of role this will play if The Stalker’s storyline continues will be interesting, knowing now that he has had a huge development of character in<em> Jade Shadows.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-combat-abilities-skill-tree-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you're at all familiar with the Dragon Age series, you likely already know BioWare has experimented quite a lot with its gameplay. From <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_origins/b/pc/archive/2009/10/05/review.aspx">Dragon Age: Origins'</a> real-time strategy RPG approach to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_ii/b/xbox360/archive/2011/03/08/dragon-age-ii-console-review-amid-improvements-bioware-leaves-story-behind.aspx#:~:text=No%20longer%20trying%20to%20straddle,it%20suits%20the%20game%20well.">Dragon Age II's</a> mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_inquisition/b/playstation4/archive/2014/11/10/dragon-age-inquisition-review-game-informer.aspx">Dragon Age: Inquisition's</a> strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/DragonAgeTheVeilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground for Dragon Age combat. Of course, it's hard to tell how Veilguard's action will hold up over what is sure to be a dozens-of-hours-long RPG, but if what I've seen so far is any indication, the studio is on to something.</p>

<h2>A Shift In Strategy</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0a68d9ad-db75-4ac9-9b0c-8105011dcc80" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>"I think the first thing to keep in mind is that combat [...] in the franchise has been an evolution," game director Corinne Busche tells me within BioWare's Edmonton office. "Every single entry reimagines what combat is like and I would say our goal was to make sure we had a system that allowed players to feel like they actually were able to step into the world of Thedas. They're not a player observing from afar – they are inside of this world. Being this authentic world that's brought to life, the combat system needs to support that, so you are in control of every single action, every block, every dodge, every swing of your sword."</p>

<p>Busche says players complete every swing in real-time, with particular attention paid to animation swing-through and canceling. On the topic of canceling, I watch Busche "bookmark" combos with a quick dash. With this mechanic, players can pause a combo's status with a dash to safety and continue the combo where they left off afterward. Alongside the dash, there's a parry for some classes, the ability to charge moves, and a revamped healing system that allows players to quickly use potions by pressing right on the d-pad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Busche says each character will play the same in a way, regardless of class, in that you execute light and heavy attacks with the same buttons, use abilities with the same buttons, and interact with the combo wheel in the same way. During my demo at one point, we use a sword-and-shield Warrior Qunari that hip-fires and aims their shield to throw it like Captain America while hammering down big damage with a sword. Pressing the same buttons as a mage might throw out magical ranged attacks instead of a shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Abilities, like a Spartan-like kick from a Warrior or a Mage's firewall that deals continuous damage, add to the player's repertoire of combat options. Warriors can parry incoming attacks, staggering enemies in the process. Rogues have a larger parry window, and Mages can't parry at all but instead throw up a shield that blocks all incoming damage so long as they have the mana to sustain the shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That is just the baseline that allows us to get that level of immersion of, 'I'm actually in this world; I'm a part of it,'" Busche says. "But again, the abilities, the strategy, linking my companions' abilities together to perform devastating combos, that is really where the depth and the complexity comes into play."</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.none_original_image" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;Warrior Rook Skill Tree&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fbcf4084-cb82-4d2a-b0e9-5f8394b4ebc5" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>





<p>Warrior Rook Skill Tree</p>

</article><p>This extends to companions, who, at your choosing, bring three abilities (of their five total) into combat, executed either with quick select buttons or the pause-and-play combat wheel. Every time you rank up a companion's Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion – this is how you unlock new combat abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though companion skill trees pale in comparison to Rook's expansive tree, which features passive abilities, combat abilities, and more, as well as paths to three unique class specializations, there's still some customization here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can find the skill tree for Rook and companions within Veilguard's start or pause menu. This menu contains pages for Veilguard's map, journal, character sheets, and a library for lore information, too. Here, you can cross-compare equipment and equip new gear for Rook and companions, build weapon loadouts, and customize your abilities and builds via the aforementioned skill tree, which looks relatively easy to understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won't find minutiae here, "just real numbers," Busche says. In other words, a new unlocked trait might increase damage by 25% against armor, but that's as in-depth as the numbers get. Passive abilities unlock jump attacks and guarantee critical hit opportunities, while abilities add moves like firewall and spartan kicks to your arsenal. As you spec out this skill tree, which is 100% bespoke to each class, you'll work closer to unlocking a specialization (which doesn't take reaching the max level of 50). Every class has three specializations, each with a unique ultimate ability. Busche says BioWare's philosophy with the skill tree is "about changing the way you play, not the statistical minutiae."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Companions In Combat</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="19d2c27c-cd9d-45f4-b860-def974c9adca" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>If you completely ignore companions in combat, they will attack targets, use abilities, and defeat enemies all on their own. "[Companions] are their own people, "Busche says. "They have their own behaviors, they have their own autonomy on the battlefield, they'll pick their own targets. As their plots progress, they'll learn how to use their abilities more competently, and it really feels like you're fighting alongside these realized characters in battle."</p>

<p>Speaking to companion synergy, Busche adds, "I see all the abilities Harding has, and I see everything that Bellara is capable of. And sometimes, I'm using vulnerabilities synergistically. Maybe I'm pausing or slowing time with Bellara so that I can unleash devastating attacks with Harding, knocking down the enemy, and then me, as Rook, I'm rushing in and capitalizing on this setup they've created for me. It is a game about creating this organic sense of teamwork."</p>

<p>Busche says there are more explicit synergies, with intentional combos where specific companions can play off each other, and you can queue up their abilities to do just that. That’s what the pause-and-play combat wheel is for in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this screen, which pauses the camera and pulls up a flashy combat wheel that highlights you and your companions' skills, you can choose abilities, queue them up, and strategize with synergies and combos the game recognizes, all while targeting specific enemies. Select what you want and release the wheel to watch your selections play out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e5156987-c749-4b55-a850-e154a57b4fea" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>During a mission within Arlathan Forest after Veilguard's prologue, Busche utilizes Veilguard's dual-loadout mechanic. As Rook, you can create two weapon loadouts for quick switch-ups mid-combat. As a mage Rook, she uses magical attacks to add three stacks of arcane build-up to make an Arcane Bomb on a Sentinel, a mechanical set of armor possessed by a demon. If you hit the Sentinel's Arcane Bomb with a heavy attack, the enemy will take devastating damage. Once the Sentinel has an Arcane Bomb on it, Busche begins charging a heavy attack on her magical staff, then switches to magical daggers in Rook's second loadout, accessed with a quick tap of down on the d-pad to unleash some quick light attacks, then back to the staff to finish charging its attack. She then unleashes the heavy attack, and the Arcane Bomb explodes in a liquidy whirl of green magic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've seen [Veilguard's combat] refined over time [and] I love it," BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me. "I love that balance of real-time fluid action, but also the ability to have the depth in the RPG, not just in terms of pause-and-play, but the depth in terms of how you bring your companions into the battlefield. What are you going to do with their skill points? What's the loadout you're going to use? Everything is about bringing Rook to the center of the battlefield, and I love it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former Dragon Age executive producer and Veilguard consultant Mark Darrah feels Veilguard is the first game where the combat is legitimately fun. "What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap," he says. "Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.' In this game, the combat's actually fun, but it does keep that thread that's always been there. You have the focus on Rook, on your character, but still have that control and character coming into the combat experience from the other people in your party."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get the sense from watching Busche play several hours of Veilguard that BioWare has designed a combat system that relies heavily on players extracting what they want out of it. If you want to button mash and use abilities freely when their cooldowns expire, you can probably progress fine (although on the game's easier difficulties). But if you want to strategize your combos, take advantage of elemental vulnerabilities, and min-max companions and Rook loadouts, you can do that, too, and I think you'll find Veilguard rewards that with a more enriching experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="187" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since <em>XDefian</em>t first launched, players have been begging for Team Deathmatch to be added as a game mode. An overwhelming wave of demand worked, as Ubisoft finally confirmed its addition. </p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1803118032207634816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Team Deathmatch goes live as a new game mode on June 21 at 10 a.m. PT. Playing the objective is fun and often rewarding when it leads to a victory for your team. However, sometimes, when you log on, you would rather turn your brain off and strictly go after enemies. Team Deathmatch is the perfect game mode for players seeking out that experience. </p> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">Team Deathmatch is a classic first-person shooter game mode in which the only objective is to get as many kills as possible. The winner of the match is the team that reaches the point limit first or the squad that has the most kills at the end of the time limit. As in the case with other titles such as <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, this game mode will probably be one of the most played game modes when it goes live. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>What has two words, no objectives, and has been a frequent community request for many moons? </p><p>Jump into Team Deathmatch this Friday, June 21st at 10AM PT. <a href="https://t.co/QV4gTeK6dy">pic.twitter.com/QV4gTeK6dy</a></p></div>— XDefiant (@PlayXDefiant) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1803118032207634816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="763" data-injectable="true">X<em>Defiant</em> features two different types of maps. Arena environments are designed for game modes like Occupy and Hot Shot, as they are smaller and ideal for fast-paced battles. On the other hand, liner maps are more tailored for modes like Escort and Zone Control because the game modes demand a larger battlefield. Ubisoft did not reveal which maps the game mode will be available on, but it will most likely only be available on arena maps, based on the criteria. </p>
 <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="170" data-injectable="false">As for other highly requested game modes, <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin previously <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-search-and-destroy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> on June 5 that Search and Destroy will be added in a future update. </p>

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nintendo announced the phenomenal-looking <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> during its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-in-the-nintendo-direct-for-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>. Alongside that announcement, the company also casually dropped a reveal for the beautiful Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition. </p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">This console is a special edition of the Nintendo Switch Lite, possibly the best ever made. In the past, we’ve had slight variations on the design, the most recent of which was for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-crossing-new-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, but only the <em>Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em> and <em>Sword and Shield</em> <em>Editions</em> really went anywhere with their designs. The Hyrule Edition kicks things up a notch with a striking look for what looks to be an amazing game. </p>
 <h2 id="h-where-to-buy-the-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition" data-injectable="false">Where to buy the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Nintendo has shifted to a pattern of announcing special edition consoles for its games prior to a pre-order date. While we know the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition is a fabulous new device that will be released on <strong>September 26, 2024</strong>, the pre-order opening date will differ from this. </p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">At the time of writing, there are no online stores where you can pre-order the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition. All you can do is <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register your interest</a> in the console on Nintendo’s official store page. It’s impossible to say when pre-orders for the console will go live, but based on how previous special edition pre-order dates have worked, it should be a couple of months before the release date. </p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Registering your interest doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get to pre-order the console. I’ve registered my interest before and have still had to fight the onslaught of customers hoping to buy a copy of a collector’s edition of a game or a special edition of a console directly from Nintendo. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">I would expect some online stores, such as <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GAME in the UK</a>, to have an allocation of stock for the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition. Store listings won’t appear until the company knows how much stock it has to offer. When they do go live, I’ll add those store pages here. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-the-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition" data-injectable="false">What is the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94RTrH2erPE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="false">The Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition is a special <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> edition Nintendo Switch Lite. It features a gold color on the device itself, a Triforce symbol on the bottom left-hand corner of the face of the device, and the incredible franchise logo on the back. It’s a celebration of all things <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> packed into Nintendo’s sleekest version of the console to date. </p>

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ubisoft expedited <em>XDefiant’s</em> weapon leveling process by decreasing the XP requirement. However, to maintain player engagement, the development team made the weapon mastery unlock process harder, dividing players. </p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-june-18-patch-notes-faster-weapon-leveling-improved-netcode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 18 <em>XDefiant</em> update,</a> Ubisoft lowered the XP needed to level up a primary weapon from 3.500 to 3,000 and a secondary weapon from 1,500 to 1,000. As a counterbalance, the Bronze camo level was increased from 50 to 100, Silver from 75 to 150, and Gold from 100 to 200. </p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">Previously, <em>XDefiant</em> developer Patrick ‘ACHES’ Price <a href="http://Patrick ‘ACHES’ Price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> that one kill equals 100 XP, meaning it took around 35 kills per level. Considering that there are 18 primary weapons and all attachments aren’t unlocked until level 43, that’s a steep undertaking for a player of any skill level. Multiple double XP weekends have helped aid the cause, but it wasn’t enough to satisfy a growingly frustrated player base. </p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"><em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin stepped in and <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1803068682479800737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that players were unlocking attachments slower than originally intended, so this update should make it easier. But it’s the weapon mastery re-balancing that’s raised eyebrows.<em> XDefiant </em>content creator NerosCinema argued that the update makes no sense because while the it’s nice that you can unlock attachments for primary weapons 14 percent faster, doubling the level requirement for mastery camos is too harsh of a change. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The new XDefiant update makes no sense to me</p><p>Primary guns level up 14% faster, which is nice, but it still does nothing to reward objective play</p><p>Also: Bronze camo is now level 100, Silver 150, and Gold at 200? Doubling the camo grind makes no sense to me at all. Camos were the…</p></div>— NerosCinema (@NerosCinema) <a href="https://twitter.com/NerosCinema/status/1803130461385789683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">In response to complaints, Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1803068682479800737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>, “Weapon Mastery on the other hand does not affect gameplay and is supposed to be something special that shows off your dedication to a weapon. And so the re-balance of levels was in response to that.” </p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">14 percent will make a substantial difference, and that will be even more noticeable on double XP weekends moving forward. But asking players to reach level 200 on every weapon instead of 100 is a tall order and possibly too harsh of an ask. Players who have already unlocked all three mastery camos for a weapon won’t lose them, but it’s also not necessarily fair that players who missed out now have to work twice as hard for the achievement. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Another issue is players only get weapon XP from kills. As a result, players don’t get rewarded for playing the objective, which leads to users only hunting kills. Thankfully, this update is retroactive, meaning every player will have higher weapon levels than before. But it’s clear that the system still needs work, and players aren’t fully satisfied. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> already has in-development DLCs which will see its 18-wheelers head to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/american-truck-simulators-arkansas-dlc-is-under-development">Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/american-truck-simulators-next-expansion-takes-the-truck-sim-to-missouri">Missouri</a>, but SCS Software have also commenced building a third: Iowa.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/5956653982594462600">announcement on Steam</a> chatters about the sights on offer within the state, from the capital Des Moines to the scenic views of the Mississippi River. It also notes that while "Iowa isn't the biggest State in the USA, it is certainly home to a lot of 'The World's Biggest...' You'll find plenty of interesting landmarks on your journey." 
</p>
<p>Naturally I had to Google this, and I have learned that Iowa is home to the largest: garden gnome, bull statue, starberry statue, and Cheeto (not a statue). I hope every single one of these is present in the game, even if the Cheeto is technically too small to see from your cab window.
</p>
<p>You will, of course, also drive past a lot of corn fields. Those are my abiding memory of riding across Iowa on a train fifteen or so years ago.
</p>
<p>There's no release date for the expansion yet - those tend to come very near to release, and I'd imagine Arkansas and Missouri will see daylight first. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025440/American_Truck_Simulator__Iowa/">more screenshots over on Steam, though</a>.</p>

<p id="NLAH2v">As described in Polygon’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24170532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-preview-release-date"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> preview</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">initial impressions</a>, the DLC is fundamentally “more <em>Elden Ring</em>.” For the most part, that means: sprawling dungeons, relentless enemies, and a vast sense of discovery.</p>
<p id="dTrj1I">For one thing, according to our preview, the expansion is significantly more difficult than the base game. There are new types of collectibles in the mix (including power-ups called Scadutree Fragments). Narratively, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> focuses on Miquella, whom you may know as the brother of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24176307/malenia-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat">Malenia</a>, one of the most notorious boss fights from the base game.</p>
<p id="IXte23">We’re a bit close to the wire, but if you’re still getting ready for the expansion, see our guides on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-start-dlc-access-point-location-miquellas-cocoon">how to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24126482/how-to-prepare-dlc-gear-quests-endgame">how to prepare for the DLC</a>. At the very least, you’ll need to defeat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mohg</a> — something <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176047/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-preparation-achievements-completed">roughly two-thirds of players <em>haven’t</em> done</a>. Good luck!</p>

Zero, the upcoming installment in the beloved anime arena fighter, is poised to be one of the biggest video game releases for diehard Dragon Ball fans. Just when the game felt like it couldn’t be any more of a love letter to the series, a voice actor from the anime seemingly confirmed that one of the most underappreciated Super Saiyan forms would be making its way to the game as well. </p><p>During a Dragon Ball Z cast panel at Anime Riverside 2024, longtime Goku voice actor Sean Schemmel discussed the challenge of voicing different characters in the series and giving them their own unique voice. In a video <a href="https://youtu.be/pGeH0eFzy6A?t=684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>uploaded to YouTube by JimmyisaGeek</u></a>, Schemmel seemingly let it slip that Super Saiyan 4 Goku will be playable in Sparking! Zero. </p><p>“I didn’t realize that subtly changing the voice for every single form was gonna bite me in the ass later, and so keeping track of all that for like Super Saiyan 4, Super Saiyan 3, God mode, Red, was all real subtle,” Schemmel said. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO News, Posts &amp; Fan Hub (@DBSparkingZER0) <a href="https://twitter.com/DBSparkingZER0/status/1802947580206129383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Schemmel credits Damon Mills, the voice actor for Frieza, for helping him keep track of Goku’s Super Saiyan voices on "this last game we’ve been working on.” While Schemmel could be speaking about any Dragon Ball game, there’s a high probability he’s talking about Sparking Zero, seeing as how Mills <a href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1733988353119551659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>serves as the game’s lead voice director</u></a>.</p><p>“Damon has been on top of keeping all my references in line. Going through making sure everything’s right. Really nitpicking it. It’s a very challenging thing to do, but it's really easy so long as you keep vocal references around because the second I can hear it, I can do it,” Schemmel said.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/vs-youtube-dragonballgt-gokussj4hdaiupscale-117-1718740736357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Super Saiyan 4 Goku in Dragon Ball GT.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Super Saiyan 4, developed by Toei Animation character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru, is one of the most visually unique designs in the Dragon Ball mythos. Contrary to other Super Saiyan forms, which see a color and length change for their Saiyan warriors, Super Saiyan 4 leans in on the Great ape design from OG Dragon Ball by giving its heroes colored fur and a tail. Super Saiyan 4 is also considered the best thing to come out of Dragon Ball’s universally reviled sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, among longtime fans. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Prior to Schemmel seemingly spilling the senzu beans about Super Saiyan 4, fans were hard at work <a href="https://x.com/Burcol/status/1802827785679065270?t=nxhZ0x9dD2EI3d8PfAgQ8A&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeze-framing blurry microscopic shots</a> from the latest Sparking! Zero trailer theorizing Super Saiyan 4 Goku being in the game. Those theory crafters are likely breathing a sigh of relief that their speculations weren’t unfounded. </p><p>Schemmel’s apparent Super Saiyan 4 confirmation not only means <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goes-super-saiyan-heavy-with-reveal-of-first-24-characters">another Goku is being added to Sparking! Zero’s sizeable roster</a>, it could also indicate other super Saiyan 4 characters like Vegeta and Gogeta making their way to the fighter as well. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-like-controlling-a-battle-from-the-anime"><u>our preview</u></a> for Sparking! Zero, we praised the game for feeling like its battles were lifted right out of the anime, saying, “Even after just a dozen or so matches against the CPU, it became clear to me that Dragon Ball superfans who are exceptionally good at fighting games – or those who intend to practice a lot with Sparking Zero – are going to find themselves having a great time crushing their competition.”</p><p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is slated to launch on October 11 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/arena-breakout-infinite-beta-impressions-this-is-no-mere-mobile-port<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Off the battlefield, the marketplace awaits.</h2></div><section><p>Arena Breakout: Infinite is both an economy and a video game. The point-to-point action is a pure first-person shooter. You will be deployed into a few abandoned acres of countryside—similar to the ghost towns of Urzikstan or Erangel—and be asked to shoot your way towards extraction with as much loot as possible in tow. Of course, once you and your friends return to the main menu and have converted all of that booty into cold hard cash, you'll be confronted with Arena Breakout's vast marketplace, gleaming with cosmetics, firearm attachments, or even just a few extra clips of ammunition. It aims to be a game about getting rich and staying rich when one stray headshot might take it all away. </p><p>Arena Breakout aims to be a steely military simulator, with no Call of Duty-style acrobatics or titanic Battlefield set pieces. You craft a grim soldier in the character creator and outfit them with a knapsack of survival gear, which all needs to fit, like Tetris blocks, within your limited inventory. (Generally speaking, you'll be bringing body armor, a backpack, a wealth of food and medical supplies, and yes, lots and lots of ammunition.) Over the course of a match, our hero may grow hungry, or thirsty, or need the bullet in their arm to be removed. With luck, you will have brought the perfect antidote for all of those tasks, avoiding an untimely end to the campaign. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Arena Breakout: Infinite Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In that sense, Arena Breakout might remind you of the venerable survival-sim DayZ, where the player's marching orders are to hunker down and survive for as long as they can until the zombies inevitably come for their brains. But instead of an inevitable dirge towards destruction, Arena Breakout instead partitions its matches into 30 minute chunks, where our job is to gather a whole bunch of loot locked away in safes and coffers around the map before heading towards an extraction point to get out of Dodge. It's a formula that adds a good amount of flexibility for playstyles—both the maniacs and the campers will have plenty to love.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arena Breakout looked categorically gorgeous on my four-year old PC.</p></div><p>It also certainly helps that Arena Breakout looked categorically gorgeous on my four-year old PC. Infinite is developed by Level Infinite and is a spinoff of a hugely popular mobile shooter with the same name. Going in, I expected a good amount of iPhone jank interfering with the action. But that wasn't the case at all. The maps here are finely detailed and rich with exploitable angles and coverage, and the total draw distance rivals what you might find in more prominent open-world multiplayer shooters. But most impressive of all might be the gun-nut obsessiveness with which you can customize a whole range of firearms to meet your exact build. Shotguns, bolt-action rifles, machine guns, pistols, all completely modular and malleable—and all rendered beautifully when protruding from the bottom of your screen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Arena Breakout is PvPvE, which is to say that in each match you play, you'll be finding a swathe of easily dispatchable bots bumbling around the outskirts of certain important chokepoints. (You'll take them down with ease, but don't expect them to be carrying much loot.) I like that Infinite always provides us with something to shoot at, considering this sort of shooter formula can get bogged down in the doldrums pretty quickly. Furthermore, the marketplace, where you offload your riches, is a game unto itself. Every item in the Arena Breakout inventory seems to hinge on a sliding scale of supply and demand. Did you spend most of your time in World of Warcraft being a shark at the Orgrimmar auction house? Well, we certainly have a shooter for you.</p><p>But this also gets to my only real anxiety about Infinite as it stands. Arena Breakout is about scoring loot, and ratcheting up thresholds of lethal material, turning your character into a progressively more effective killing machine. But some of those gearing thresholds are punitive. Superior ammunition tiers are necessary for penetrating stronger armor, so to stay ahead of the curve, players are incentivized to dump a lot of time and effort into their extraction runs. Will that grind grow punitive over time? Especially when all it takes is one unlucky ambush for you to lose everything you're carrying? So far, I've enjoyed walking the tightrope that Arena Breakout is stringing out for us. Let's just hope we don't fall off.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Less than a day after publisher Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-canceled-after-being-indefinitely-delayed-a-month-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled <em>Life by You</em></a>, the company announced that the game’s developer Paradox Tectonic <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is shutting down</a>.</p> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">The news was delivered earlier this morning by the publisher. Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, called the move, which affects 24 people, “difficult and drastic,” and shutting down the studio was a “tough decision.” </p> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on <em>Life by You</em>’s Early Access release,” Wester said. “Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre.”</p>

In a quote, Wester said the game would not meet expectations: “A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release<em>.</em>” The decision resulted in an estimated $19.8 million write-down for the company, which has seen other trouble as of late. Last year, the company announced it would write down <em>The Lamplighters League</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/paradox-is-taking-a-write-down-on-the-lamplighters-league/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for approximately $23 million</a> a week after the game launched. </p>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="false">It has been troubling all around.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch is on its last legs, with a successor lurking in its shadow to such a degree that Nintendo has felt the need to repeatedly inform people that it won’t be present at events like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today’s Nintendo Direct</a>. But you wouldn’t have known it from watching, well, today’s Nintendo Direct: If the original Switch is going down, it’s going down swinging. A new <em>Zelda </em>where you (finally) play as Zelda and the long-awaited re-reveal of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> grabbed headlines, but the Switch’s dying gasp has breadth. In this regard, Nintendo continues to buck industry trends and go its own way. Good!&nbsp;</p><p>Last week I wrote about my <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-showcase-summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of enthusiasm</a> toward Microsoft’s bench of tired franchises, and there’s no denying that Nintendo <em>loves</em> a time-honored franchise. Zelda and Samus predate Marcus Fenix and Fable He/She/They by multiple decades. But Nintendo’s great strength is that it maintains a keen sense of when to Get (Economically) Weird With It. While <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is long overdue, it’s otherwise a great example of this: The game is built from the same foundation as the <em>Link’s Awakening</em> remake, but it’s got a new main character and central mechanic to match. I, for one, cannot wait to <a href="https://x.com/HarrisFoster/status/1803074649325973714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">table</a> Ganon to death.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is similar. It’s not a mainline series entry – I’m sure Nintendo is saving that for the Switch 2 – but it continues a role-playing side saga that other companies would do well to learn from if they insist on going back to the same franchise wells time and time again. Let characters explore additional genres and worlds. Make games both large and small. Vary players’ diets. Man cannot live on triple-A tentpoles alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, of course, there’s <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which was honestly the least exciting part of the showcase to me. It looked fine! I guess I just expected more after years of waiting and a slightly worrisome <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/metroid-prime-4-development-restarting-from-the-beginning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development reboot in 2019</a>. But it exists. And rather than saving it for the Switch 2, Nintendo is letting it serve as the original Switch’s swan song in 2025, with an impressively stacked 2024 lineup getting the crowd warmed up for it. I’ve yet to even mention <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, <em>Pokemon Legends Z-A</em>, and a whole host of third-party gems like<em> Fantasian: Neo Dimension</em>, <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, Romancing Saga 2</em>, and the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake, most of which are coming out this year or early next.&nbsp;</p><p>I will readily admit my biases here: I’m grading on a curve since one would typically expect far less than this from a console near the end of its life, and I also like RPGs. Even so, this is a strong procession of games that are all coming soon. I’m not always certain if I was correct to buy a PlayStation 5, and I doubt I’ll ever pick up an Xbox Series X, but I know exactly what I’m going to be playing on my Nintendo Switch in the near future. That kind of consistency is an underrated quality, one that’s easy to take for granted. Not only that, but Nintendo has maintained it over the course of the Switch’s entire life cycle. Despite being seven years old, my Switch has never collected dust.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo knows what works for it, and over the years it has stayed that course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at times to its own detriment</a>. But when it works, it really works. The Switch has been a smash success, which has allowed Nintendo to stick to its guns even as it navigates an industry that’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling down on fewer, bigger games</a>. It is notable that Nintendo hasn’t laid off hundreds or thousands of workers in the past couple years, nor has it jumped aboard the forever game bandwagon (unless<em> Mario Kart 8</em> counts). I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that the former is <a href="https://x.com/haleyfax/status/1803052670611038472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a result of labor law</a> as much as it is anything else, but there’s also a hopeful truth at the core of Nintendo’s approach: If you create something good and dependable, people will appreciate it. You don’t have to trick or trap them to build a successful business.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, they’ll keep coming back. Nintendo doesn’t need to sink a frankly horrifying amount of time and manpower into a microtransaction-powered live service game because it has continually reached beyond the audience that would even play such a thing and given kids, adults, and just about every other imaginable demographic a bunch of friendly, imaginative experiences. Could another company pull this off without literally owning Mario, the Mickey Mouse of video games? I don’t know. But I’m glad Nintendo’s doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now please stop <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-citra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sicking your lawyers on emulators and fan projects</a>.

An open beta test will run for all platforms in all supported regions from July 18 to 23. <span id="more-893621"></span></p><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> first launched for PC on November 7, 2023 in South Korea.</p><p>“On behalf of Amazon Games and NCSOFT, I’m proud to announce that <em>Throne and Liberty</em> will launch on September 17, 2024,” said Amazon Games head of third-patty publishing Merv Lee Kwai in a press release. “We all know fans around the world have been eagerly waiting for news on when they can jump into the game. We can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on, and invite you to experience it all for yourself when the game launches this September.”</p><p>Here is a brief overview of the game, via Amazon GamesS:</p><blockquote><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> features a robust social experience, where players are encouraged to join guilds and engage with one another. Guild interactions and alliances are integral to the game experience, as players can take part in epic player-versus-environment and player-versus-player battles, such as Castle Siege, that can accommodate thousands of players at once. This all takes place in a persistent open world called Solisium, where dynamic, interactive environments affect the gameplay in meaningful ways. Unpredictable weather cycles impact how your weapons perform, alter the terrain around you, and reveal new access points. While exploring the world, players will be able to transform into creatures that fly through the air or take to the sea for rapid travel, or even morph into defeated bosses to turn the tide in battle.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>This week's Nintendo Direct was packed with announcements, but one of the most unexpected was the reveal of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1845486187299003978%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports</a>, which is slated to launch this fall for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p><p>The zany Looney Tunes sports games of the '90s were pretty enjoyable, and it's been a long time since a proper Looney Tunes sports game released in North America. The most recent iteration, Galactic Sports, was a Vita exclusive that never made it out of PAL regions, so it's nice to see a new family-friendly arcade sports game in the pipeline.</p><p dir="ltr">Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports will feature a collection of mini-games based on basketball, soccer, golf, and tennis, but with unique gameplay twists like powerups and special moves. The game includes solo and multiplayer modes, and each player will be able to control iconic Looney Tunes characters like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and more. Unsurprisingly, Wacky World of Sports is reminiscent of Mario sports games, such as the Wii's Mario Sports Mix and 3DS' Mario Sports Superstars as well the entries on Switch: <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Mario-Golf-Super-Rush-Nintendo-Switch-Games%2F432567681%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Golf: Super Rush</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1806410424423360561%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Tennis Aces</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Strikers-Battle-League-Nintendo-Switch%2F725662018%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you enjoy Mario sports games and like Looney Tunes--or are simply sad Mario Hoops 3-on-3 never received a sequel--you can <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1845486187299003978%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports</a></strong> now on consoles.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports Preorder Bonus</h2><p dir="ltr">No Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports preorder bonuses have been announced yet.</p><div title="6524382 -

            <p>Classic RPG Dragon Quest 3 is getting a remake in Square Enix's now familiar HD-2D style, which blends high-resolution 2D sprites together with 3D worlds. It'll land on November 14th. "<em>Waitaminute</em>," you might be saying, "Shouldn't they remake the first two games beforehand?" No, you numpty, you nyaff, you roaster; within the internal chronology of Dragon Quest, 3 comes first.
</p>
<p>Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

<p>The tease for DQI and DQII comes right at the very end of the above trailer, and the three games together form what Square Enix are calling the Erdrick trilogy. 
</p>
<p>The remake was announced all the way back in 2021 for the series' 35th anniversary, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announces-dragon-quest-12">alongside the announcement of Dragon Quest 12</a>, the next mainline game in the series. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's been seen since, although its re-appearance today isn't entirely a surprise, either. Square Enix teased its appearance in a tweet on 'Dragon Quest day' - May 27th, the release date of the original game in Japan in 1986. "The legend of Erdrick draws near," read <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347">the post</a>.
</p>
<p>I have not played any Dragon Quest game other than a tiny bit of DQ11, but that makes me more interested in the remakes, not less, because it feels like an opportunity to rectify my ignorance of the series. Aside from the updated graphics, Square Enix are promising that the HD-2D release will have "an improved and modernized UI, and other quality of life improvements," when it arrives later this year <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3awZkz">It’s big, big news that in the Zelda game announced during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180900/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced-games">Tuesday’s Nintendo Direct</a><em> — </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> — players will assume control of Princess Zelda rather than Link. It’s the first time in history you’ll be able to play a full game as the title character (unless you count the notably terrible CD-i games, which director Eiji Aonuma <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/ptkydm/eiji-aonuma-addresses-those-horrible-zelda-cd-i-games">doesn’t consider canon</a>). But there’s one key point of intrigue: In <em>Echoes</em>, Aonuma said Zelda doesn’t fight with a sword — ever.</p>
<p id="YHSBwc">Some longtime players, like myself, might find Zelda’s lack of a sword a bit disappointing initially. After all, she does have several swords in her possession at various points in the series: Zelda’s sword from <em>Twilight Princess </em>is definitively hers; she wields rapiers in the Hyrule Warriors games; and in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, she hangs on to the Master Sword to protect it while Link takes a 100-year nap. Usually, like Zelda herself, these weapons only appear in cutscenes and other cinematics, and it’s only in a few moments that we see her defend herself using a sword.</p>

<p id="zUHSOj">But I have a hunch that it isn’t just her character’s canon that kept Aonuma from giving her a sword in <em>Echoes</em>. Sure, it’s true that some aspects of other Zelda tales would fall apart if suddenly Zelda were a master of swordplay. In <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, for instance, she uses the harp rather than a more traditional weapon when she’s disguised as Sheik. And she certainly can’t use the Master Sword, which famously only works if Link wields it.</p>
<p id="PzBMlo">That said, it also serves <em>Echoes</em>’ gameplay — and the potential for future games that include both Link and Zelda as playable characters — for the heroine to ditch swordsmanship for this game. The decision puts a clear distinction between Zelda’s mission to harness the “power of her wisdom” and Link’s frequent quest to find varied weapons and, eventually, the Master Sword. </p>
<p id="q7HNdV">According to the Nintendo Direct, Zelda’s character will use a wand to wield the Echo power, which she can use to duplicate items in the game environment to solve puzzles and battle enemies. (Polygon senior editor Oli Welsh pointed out in our internal Slack that this mechanic is essentially Ultrahand from <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em>) Players can use Echo to copy a table or a trampoline, for instance, and paste those items in the world when they need them to hop over walls or climb a tower.</p>
<p id="F88I5I">Zelda’s Echo reminds me of the masks in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, or even the Fuse power in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> — mechanics that allow the player to solve a given puzzle in several ways, even if those methods aren’t necessarily predetermined by the developer (i.e., fusing a bunch of wooden slats together to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">make a bridge</a> to get across a chasm). Particularly during the months following the release of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, tons of players considered their solutions to be outside of what the developers intended — and indeed, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/24001489/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-developer-interview">Aonuma told Polygon</a>, “I was surprised to see what people have gotten up to in the game. [...] It’s something that kind of blew my mind. I mean, there are limits to how many objects you can put together. But people really rushed to find out what those limits were, and that was surprising to me.”</p>

</p>
<p id="bcLoSK">The trailer for <em>Echoes</em> included a clip of Zelda stacking several water cubes, then stepping into them to float to the top, where she steps out onto a previously inaccessible area. It’s gameplay like that that makes me fully trust Nintendo’s decision to keep Zelda swordless. In <em>Echoes</em>, she has the power to replicate items she can use to defend herself, not to mention that she can duplicate enemies and use them to fight on her behalf (like any good princess should).</p>
<p id="uQRL6C">In all, Zelda’s swordless-ness does not seem to be a ploy to keep her less powerful or more dainty than Link — instead, it’s a reminder that the franchise isn’t only about the Master Sword. Moreover, it’s a reminder that Zelda’s greatest power is her intellect, which she uses time and again throughout the franchise to trick enemies, empower her friends, and lead with compassion. </p>

You see, despite Zelda being the namesake of the series, Link has been the protagonist of most of the franchise. For a long time, fans have hoped for a Zelda-led title that would reverse their roles, making it so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-trailer-release-date-link-1851546323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-trailer-release-date-link-1851546323">Link is the one being saved by Zelda</a></span>. This hypothetical game’s name: why, <em>The Legend of Link</em>, of course.</p><p>In their excitement, many took to Twitter to jokingly declare that Nintendo <em>obviously </em>got the name of the game wrong. Others have taken the opportunity to show off their own fan art of the concept of a Zelda-led game.</p><p>And then there’s this big brain play.<br></p><p>As fun as it is to ponder why Nintendo didn’t actually go forward with the joke, there are two very likely reasons. The first is that Nintendo’s developers may be so detached from the internet and all the jokes we make on there that it never seriously crossed anyone’s mind. Nintendo is known for actually retaining its staff, which is why there are so many senior folks there that have worked on some of these franchises for literal decades, like Aonuma. They probably don’t pay all the chatter online any mind, and hey, good for them.<br></p><p>The more likely case is that it absolutely did come up at some point, but in order to keep the brand intact, they went forward with the <em>Legend of Zelda </em>moniker. Also, the last time there was a Zelda-led game that changed up the naming scheme…it kind of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda%27s_Adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda%27s_Adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sucked</a></span>.<br></p><p>As funny as <em>The Legend of Link</em> is, it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue in the same way. Though you and I may be certain it isn’t confusing, there are other more casual gamers and purchasers who might be thrown for a loop by the sudden name change. There are already people who think Link is named Zelda because he’s the hero of the games, so naming the Zelda-led game after Link might give someone an aneurysm. Much as I hate it, it’s just simpler this way, but <em>The Legend of Link</em> shall live on in all our hearts and minds. And Twitter now, I guess.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-order-should-you-read-iain-m-banks-culture-series.905340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-order-should-you-read-iain-m-banks-culture-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-order-should-you-read-iain-m-banks-culture-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re considering delving into the Iain M. Banks’ Culture series, you would be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work and deciding what order to read them in. Thankfully, it is mostly down to personal preference, so here is mine.</p> <h2 id="h-what-order-to-read-the-culture-series" data-injectable="false">What order to read the Culture series</h2> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">When I read these books the first time, I picked them up more or less in order of publication and read them this way. Now, I would like to prelude this piece by saying that it is perfectly fine. But, looking back, I may have done it a little differently. There are good works and great works, and some curious ones, too. This means that it is possible to gain a little more from your first time <a href="https://geni.us/uAaZt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">reading the <em>Culture</em> series</a> if you choose a different order.</p>
 <h3 id="h-1-player-of-games" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/9d5Uy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#1 Player of Games</a></h3> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">Although this is the second of Iain M. Banks’s published works in the <em>Culture</em> series, I would put it first in the reading order. The world of <a href="https://geni.us/9d5Uy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Player of Games</em></a> perfectly introduces the reader to the <em>Culture</em> series without boring them. It also really shows off the scale and brilliance of what is to come in the rest of the books. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><em>Player of Games</em> shows off Banks’ wonderful imagination for adventure and inventiveness. Humans’ minds are tested to the limits under insane and wonderful situations, while sentient AIs look on in benevolent glory. <em>Player of Games</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rollercoaster ride</a> from beginning to end.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit </figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-2-use-of-weapons" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/tw4rtu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#2 Use of Weapons</a></h3> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">This is a great second book in the order of the <em>Culture</em> series due to its display of the creativity Iain M. Banks is capable of. The book is set into two opposing narratives, with each chapter focusing on an alternative timeline. One is moving backward chronologically, and the other forwards.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Aside from the wonderful storytelling and Banks’ ability to write war of such galactic magnitude, this is just a taste of things to come. The <em>Culture</em> series has a number of books in the collection that are a little out there in their narrative. This is what makes the series one of the all-time greats. <a href="https://geni.us/tw4rtu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Use of Weapons</em></a> is an exciting and accessible introduction to it.</p> <h3 id="h-3-consider-phlebas" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Q9yI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#3 Consider Phlebas</a></h3> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">This book gets a bad rap, but it is where I started because it was first published. It has often been blamed for the reason people won’t pick up a second <em>Culture</em> novel after the first: some find it dull. It focuses on one episode of a galactic war told from many points of view.</p>
 <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true">While creative and, I think, wonderful to read, it doesn’t really show off just what the <em>Culture</em> series is all about. Taking this book as the third will still make the references to the Idiran War in the later books relevant. However, by this point, you’ll be more willing to give Banks at least one slow book. Canonically it is important to understand the goings on in <a href="https://geni.us/Q9yI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Consider Phlebas</em></a>, but it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t his most</a> gripping work.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-excession" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/KKG7p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#4 Excession</a></h3> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">To pick things back up after the slow but still wonderful <em>Consider Phelbes</em>, you should consider <a href="https://geni.us/KKG7p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Excession</em></a>. This book is a wonderful example of how Iain M. Banks can broach subjects as large and complex as interdimensional superstructures while still maintaining a truly engaging romance story involving gender fluidity and childbirth.</p> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">This book is a real delve into the weird and wonderful mind of Iain M. Banks when he is given the freedom of true science fiction.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-5-look-to-windward" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/tNb8p2S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#5 Look to Windward</a></h3> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/tNb8p2S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Look to Windward</em></a> is a fantastic delve into some of the many varied and inventive races that exist within the Culture. Look to Windward is a perfect midpoint novel to read in the order of the <em>Culture </em>series for a few reasons. By this point, as readers, we are familiar with the AI and their varied, eccentric personalities. This is played upon heavily in <em>Look to Windward</em>, with the true humanity and relationship with physical beings being properly explored.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-matter" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/6Bm8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#6 Matter</a></h3> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/6Bm8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Matter</em></a> is no laughing matter and it could threaten the structural integrity of any shelf it sits upon. The book itself is a monster and shouldn’t be attempted by anyone not already invested in the <em>Culture</em> series. I personally consider it one of my favorites due to its complexity, vast scope, and thrilling narrative, but I was already deeply invested in the Banks’ universe. </p> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true"><em>Matter</em> is a monster, but it rarely feels like a chore. If you have already become familiar with the world of <em>Culture</em>, then this book is just what the doctor ordered. It is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a true epic</a> in the series and a pleasure on every page. </p>
 <h3 id="h-7-surface-detail" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/W2wEW9B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#7 Surface Detail</a></h3> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Iain M. Banks plays with many interesting concepts in <a href="https://geni.us/W2wEW9B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Surface Detail</em></a>. The idea of human-created hells, capitalism, humans being in control of their own afterlives, and the threat of binding contracts are all wrapped up in this book. It is wild, scary, often horrific, and complex in its various branches and is a real moral workout.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">As a standalone book, this is a wonderful choice. It clearly demonstrates Iain M. Banks’ ability to make the most of the science fiction genre. It can be picked up in any order of the <em>Culture</em> series or outside of it completely.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-the-hydrogen-sonata" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/tlGL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#8 The Hydrogen Sonata</a></h3> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">I remember finishing this book and doing what I always did by immediately popping to my local bookshop for the next in the series. Finding out this was the final one left a gaping hole in my literary heart. It was like saying goodbye to a friend, not knowing it would be the last time we ever spoke. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/tlGL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>The Hydrogen Sonata</em></a> is a fitting end to what I consider to be the core <em>Culture</em> novels in the order you can read them. It deals with the idea of death and the end, using a race of beings as the final goodbye Banks gives to his readers. It is deep and complex and addresses the complexity of ‘The End’ and what it all means.</p>
 <h3 id="h-9-inversions" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/oKsh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#9 Inversions</a></h3> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">Banks has described this as an “attempt to write a culture novel that wasn’t,” and that pretty much sums it up. In this entry to the <em>Culture</em> series, we say goodbye to the mega ships controlled by AI and the comfort of a world of excess and plenty and instead are brought down to a planet representing Medieval Europe. <a href="https://geni.us/oKsh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Inversions</em></a>, despite being a <em>Culture</em> novel, is an unusual one in the lineup, but one I love none the less. A good book for after the madness of intergalactic adventure.</p>
 <h3 id="h-10-the-state-of-the-art" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/EUYM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#10 The State of The Art</a></h3> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="false">This <a href="https://geni.us/EUYM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">collection of short stories</a> is a wonderful way to flesh out the <em>Culture</em> series at the end of the reading list order. These short stories expand on the Culture’s relationship to Earth and introduce some interesting characters and concepts. This collection of stories is Banks typically flexing his creative muscle. As a book, it can easily be picked up and put down throughout the list of <em>Culture</em> books as you read them. They are a lovely way to pepper one of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-science-fiction-book-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best science fiction series of all time</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unstoppable-board-game-roguelike-deck-builder-is-fully-funded-on-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has launched a new board game Kickstarter. The campaign is for the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game, a co-op roguelike momentum deck-builder by the creator of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mystic-vale-digital-edition-review-fantasy-gardener" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mystic Vale</em></a>. Within the first day, the campaign was fully funded.</p>

<p>According to the campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/renegadegamestudios/unstoppable-a-card-crafting-game-by-john-d-clair/description"><em>Unstoppable</em> board game</a> is the latest in Renegade's Solo Game series. The game is set in a sci-fi world and revolves around three planets. The cutthroat city-world of Ceres II, Virenos' deadly forests, and trash-riddled wasteland that is Mithras.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unstoppable-board-game-set-up.jpg?itok=xi-goE2i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unstoppable-board-game-set-up.jpg?itok=omdsffLy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build your cards, build your deck. Good luck.</figcaption></figure><p>The game can be played either solo or co-op with another player. You play as someone touched by fate. tasked with stopping something that threatens all three worlds. To pull that off, you will need to gather allies, train, upgrade your tools, and become unstoppable.</p>
<p>A game of <em>Unstoppable</em> is simple. You pick one of four heroes and a boss to fight. You take turns drafting and upgrading cards. You'll use these cards to face threats, level up, and gain momentum. But the longer you take, the more dangerous the boss becomes. The game ends when you win or fail.</p>
<p>Upgrading cards in the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game is thanks to the game's card-crafting system. Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/solforge-fusion-starter-kit-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Solforge Fusion</em></a>, you can stack different upgrade cards on different core cards, effectively making a unique kind of card as you play. There are 100 core cards and 36 upgrade cards in the base game, that is 3,600 possible combinations.</p>
<p>The game was designed by John D. Clair. Clair's tabletop design credits include <em>Mystic Vale</em>, the award-winning 4X card-crafting pirate game <em>Dead Reckoning </em>and the collaborative flora and fauna board game <em>Ecos: First Continen</em>t.</p>
<p>In addition, it continues Renegade Game Studio's reputation of producing experimental and ambitious board games. Their catalog include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/search-for-lost-species-funded-in-15-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Search For Lost Species</em></a>, <em>The Vale of Eternity</em>, and the silent role-playing game <em>Alice Is Missing</em>.</p>
<p>The different pledge tiers for the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Can't Stop for $60:</strong> A physical copy of the game and any unlocked stretch goals.</li>
<li><strong>Won't Stop for $75:</strong> A physical copy, any unlocked stretch goals, and an official game mat.</li>
<li><strong>Never Gonna Stop for $90</strong>: A physical copy, any unlocked stretch goals, and two official game mats.</li>
<li><strong>Unstoppable All In for $100:</strong> A physical copy, any unlocked stretch goals, and three official game mats.</li>
</ul><p>The campaign's stretch goals mostly add extra cards to the base game.Up to 12 additional Ally Cards, 6 Tactics Cards, and 5 Upgrade Cards.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game campaign has raised $62,762, more than six times its initial funding goal of $10,000. The campaign concludes July 3</p>

            <p>The Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is heading to PC later this year on September 6th. <em>"Waitaminute,"</em> you might be saying, "Didn't this already come out?" No, you choob, you eejit, you dafty, you're thinking of one of several other collections of Ace Attorney games.
</p>
<p>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection comprises two games: Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and its sequel, Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit. Neither game has been on PC before, and the latter has never been released outside of Japan.

<p>Both games star Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix Wright's jaboted prosecutorial rival. Where it differs most from the better known games is that it takes place beyond the confines of the courtroom, with Edgeworth walking about crime scenes, finding evidence, and interrogating suspects. It was also created without series creator Shu Takumi, which might account for why it's generally less loved than the Wright games.

<p>If you're a completionist, or so in love with these characters you'll follow them anywhere, then it's only a good thing that you'll soon be able to play them in English on PC. I think this means every (non-crossover) Ace Attorney game will now be on PC, between this, the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a duology). The only remaining outlier is Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, a mashup I imagine Nintendo would not allow to leave one of their platforms.
</p>
<p>Of course, this means that all that's left to do is to give Shu Takumi a giant budget to make new Ace Attorney games. In the meantime, you'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2401970/Ace_Attorney_Investigations_Collection/">the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection on Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Amazon Games revealed that NCSoft's fantasy MMORPG Throne and Liberty will arrive in North and South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in less than three months. To be exact, the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X (with cross-play, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-will-be-published-by-amazon-games-mmorpg-to-feature-crossplay-between-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>) on September 17. Amazon Games also confirmed that the business model will be free-to-play, just like in the original Korean release. An Open Beta test will take place on all platforms between July 18 and 23, allowing players to check out the game before the launch.</p>
<p>Amazon worked closely with NCSoft on the localization of Throne and Liberty over the last year. Moonyoung Choi, Camp Captain at NCSoft, said:</p>
<p><em>Although there are international players who enjoy the game on Korean servers, we don’t often have the opportunity to collect and analyze their feedback comprehensively. Collaborating with Amazon Games has allowed us to receive feedback from a wide range of global users, which was extremely valuable to us. Amazon Games didn’t simply present user needs as demands: they used various reports and data to convincingly explain to our team why certain changes were necessary and how many users wanted them.</em></p>
<p>Daniel Lafuente, Globalization Design Manager at Amazon Games, added:</p>
<p><em>From day one, we’ve been working tightly with NCSoft to make sure Throne and Liberty hits the mark for a global audience. We’ve been in the trenches together, running multiple public test phases to get direct feedback from players worldwide. That input has allowed us to really shape the game’s direction in unison with NCSoft over the last year-plus. At the end of the day, it’s been a truly collaborative effort adapting the core experience while still keeping the soul of what makes Throne and Liberty awesome.</em></p>

<p>Moonseop Lee, Game Design Director, <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/throne-and-liberty-brings-online-rpgs-into-new-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an overview of what kind of activities MMORPG fans can expect in the game:</p>
<p><em>In Throne and Liberty, there are numerous goals that can be achieved through guilds, including guild rankings, Conquest Battles, and Castle Sieges. Guilds are at the core of strategic competitive battles. Guild members not only work together to achieve common goals, but also benefit from a guild reward system that includes distributing raid items and sharing rewards from events among members. However, the greatest appeal of a guild is the sense of belonging it provides, ensuring that you always have companions by your side.</em></p>

You know, one of those <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571/slides/5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571/slides/5">old-school FPS throwbacks like <em>Dusk </em>or <em>Cultic</em>.</a></span> But that’s not the case at all! <em>Fallen Aces</em> instead plays more like <em>Thief </em>or <em>Deus Ex</em>, but styled like a 1940s comic book about mafia goons, private detectives, and masked vigilantes. Instead of running around with a shotgun and rocket launcher killing everything that moves, <em>Fallen Aces</em> is focused primarily on melee combat, stealth, and exploration. And it nails this mixture perfectly, letting you play each of the first episode’s levels in a variety of ways, all of which are viable and fun.<br></p><p>Do you want to go in with a careful plan, quietly moving from shadow to shadow using judo strikes to knock gangsters out cold and then leave before anyone knows you were there? You can do that. But you can also run in with a baseball bat and a wrench and just beat the shit out of everyone in your way, which is how I played most of <em>Fallen Aces</em>. And I had just as much fun fighting dudes as I did sneaking around baddies while exploring the game’s large and intricate levels.</p><h2 id="h26088"><a id=""></a><strong>Mighty mighty man</strong></h2><p>Something I really appreciate about<em> Fallen Aces</em> is how exciting and wild combat can be. At one point I found myself in a room with five gangsters who all wanted me dead. I had a broken baseball bat and…nothing else. In a lot of stealth-heavy games, this is the point where I might reload a save. And you can do that. But what I love about<em> Fallen Aces</em> is that fighting your way out of a rumble is just as fun as pulling off a perfect plan.<br></p><p>So when I found myself cornered by those gangsters, I looked around and found a fire extinguisher. I tossed the broken bat at one of the closer goons, grabbed the extinguisher from the wall, and sprayed the guys down with the chemical powder inside. When I saw one get stunned I ran up and kicked him into his pals. Then I turned the extinguisher around with a button press and began walloping the crew with it, breaking up my attacks with swift kicks. The last guy standing was stunned, dizzy, and set up perfectly for a finisher. I grabbed him and punched him through a window and out to the street below. Then I saved my game. Who needs stealth when you have a big metal extinguisher and a strong kick?<br></p><p>For those who prefer guns over fists and bats, <em>Fallen Aces</em> does feature firearms, too. Ammo for these weapons is hard to find and they are loud, so be prepared for all the enemies in the area to swarm you if you start shooting. But guns are also mighty powerful and helped save me during a few intense moments. And like everything else in the game, you can toss guns at enemies once you run out of ammo.<br></p><h2 id="h26089"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s all over but the crying</strong></h2><p>I’ve avoided talking about <em>Fallen Aces</em>’ story and characters not because I don’t like them or because I think the writing is bad. The narrative about a PI getting wrapped up in a wild conspiracy involving murder, crooked heroes, and fallen comrades is good stuff. And the comic book cutscenes between each episode are top-notch, too.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1082ac34d29919c63c0d9ef9377f2d0c" data-recommend-id="image://1082ac34d29919c63c0d9ef9377f2d0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows mafia goons taking on a player with a shotgun.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The problem is that you can burn through <em>Fallen Aces’ </em>first episode in about three to four hours. So while the story is great, there’s so little here that I don’t want to spoil anything. That said, by the end of the final (currently available) mission, I was excited to play more, not just because I want to bash more skulls, but because I want to see where this narrative is heading.<br></p><p>And that’s really my only <em>major </em>complaint about <em>Fallen Aces</em>: I want more of it! That’s a good problem to have, but it’s something to keep in mind when purchasing the game. The developers promise more missions and episodes are coming, and publisher New Blood has a fantastic track record for supporting and expanding its games long after release, so I’m not worried th<em>at Fallen Aces</em> will never receive another episode. I just felt it fair to note for those looking for a meatier and more complete experience.<br></p><p><em>Fallen Aces</em> is a noir-themed sneaky beat’em up that combines retro gameplay, 2D comic book visuals, large levels, and great melee combat into a fantastic package that, while some might find a bit short, is still worth playing and replaying. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The upcoming books in question — the Dungeon Master’s Guide, the Player’s Handbook, and the Monster Manual — are now available for preorder at Amazon. They cost $49.99 each, and will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-announces-updated-core-rulebook-release-dates-but-not-all-of-them-arrive-in-2024">release</a> between September 2024 and February 2025. These books bring sizable changes to the tabletop game known as One D&amp;D. New editions of the standard accessories are also available for preorder.

For starters, the Player’s Handbook will actually teach new players how to play D&amp;D. In addition to offering up a list of the rules, as the previous edition did, it has a new section with advice about how to organize and run a game session. Also, all 12 character classes now have four subclasses each, bringing a grand total of 48 subclasses. There’s also a bigger focus on non-combat abilities for the characters. </p><p>Similar tweaks, additions, and assistance for new players are coming to the Dungeon Master’s Guide and Monster Manual.

The original Dragon Quest 3 was notable for having one of the first class-switching systems in a console RPG, and a non-linear, open-world structure. The game still holds up well today, and the HD-2D Remake will likely be the definitive way to experience it when it launches on November 14.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with confirming Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake’s release date, Square Enix also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake-announced-dq3-release-date-confirmed/1100-6524357/" data-ref-id="1100-6524357">Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are getting the HD-2D remake treatment</a> and will launch in a single package in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">The art style of all three remakes aligns with Square Enix's other gorgeous HD-2D games, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLIVE-A-LIVE-Nintendo-Switch%2F378699608%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-3-hd-2d-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524380%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Live A Live</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Octopath-Traveler-II-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0BF66G8F9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Octopath Traveler 2</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Ocean-Second-Story-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C8WC4ZX7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Ocean: The Second Story R</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTriangle-Strategy-Nintendo-Switch%2F639951942%3Ffrom%3D%2Fsearch%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-3-hd-2d-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524380%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Triangle Strategy</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-book-sale-june-2024-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off/1100-6524101/">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Book Box Sets At Target - Manga, Novels, Comic Omnibuses, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/">Astro Bot Preorders Are Live - The PS5 Exclusive Comes With An Adorable Bonus</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-sale-features-rarely-discounted-exclusives-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524025/">Nintendo Switch Game Sale Features Rarely Discounted Exclusives Ahead Of Summer Game Fest</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preorders-come-with-bonus-playable-fighters/1100-6520091/">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorders Come With Bonus Playable Fighters</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorders Are Live, Includes Doctor Robotnik's Journal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hit-anime-hells-paradise-is-coming-to-blu-ray-with-an-amazon-exclusive-limited-edition/1100-6523982/">The Hit Anime Hell's Paradise Is Coming To Blu-Ray With An Amazon-Exclusive Limited Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>
