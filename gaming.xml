  <p id="oV4CNC">When game director Hidetaka Miyazaki tried to explain his then-new game <em>Demon’s Souls</em> to the masses, he chose another game as its reference point: the classic, Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired role-playing game <em>Wizardry</em>.</p>
<p id="Fj75S0">FromSoftware wanted to “make the fun and charms of a classic RPG interesting all over again with the latest technology at hand,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121017051415/http://www.1up.com/news/sony-reveals-demon-souls">Miyazaki told Famitsu in 2008</a>. “Having long weapons bump into walls, lighting the area in real time with the torch in your hand [...] taking the things you did through menus in <em>Wizardry</em> and letting you carry them out in real life.”</p>
<p id="lay03u">Miyazaki wasn’t the only one thinking this. <em>Wizardry</em> — alongside another RPG powerhouse of the early ’80s, <em>Ultima</em> — has been cited by dozens of Japanese game developers as a major influence on their defining work. That includes Final Fantasy creator <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/06/29/hironobu-sakaguchi-talks-about-his-admiration-for-dragon-quest-and-upcoming-projects/?sh=26cc9d3d15b5">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, Dragon Quest creator <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/03/dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-accepts-lifetime-achievement-award-at-22nd-annual-game-developers-choice-awards">Yuji Horii</a>, and <em>Secret of Mana</em> game director <a href="https://shmuplations.com/secretofmana/">Koichi Ishii</a>. <em>Wizardry</em> and <em>Ultima</em> defined the formula of menu-driven, turn-based RPGs for decades to come, inspiring developers to adhere to its template and to break free from it.</p>
<p id="YMZtCY">Thanks to the newly released <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em>, it’s now very easy to experience what dazzled dungeon-crawling fans of the early ’80s. <em>Wizardry:</em> <em>Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> is a modernized overhaul of the original Apple II game, with gorgeous new 3D visuals and dozens of quality-of-life improvements that make <em>Wizardry</em> more easily playable — but by no means <em>easy</em> — in 2024.</p>

<p id="nu7YRJ">The new <em>Wizardry</em> serves as a streamlined entry point into a game designed for a very different kind of player, someone who would bash their head against the RPG’s unexplained rules and rudimentary graphics to savor its authentic D&amp;D-style, party-based gameplay. The new version is lavishly repainted with graphics that ooze the atmosphere of classic tabletop RPG book art and vintage <em>Wizardry</em> magazine covers. It also makes the stats and percentages more visible, explaining why you might have failed an encounter with a party of angry kobold skeletons, slimes, or bushwackers. There’s even a rich bestiary that provides new lore entries on the game’s 101 monsters and other menaces.</p>
<p id="6I8wic">Running underneath the hood of the <em>Wizardry</em> remaster is the game’s Apple II source code, restored by developer Digital Eclipse from the original Pascal programming language. All the dice rolls and random encounters defined by classic <em>Wizardry</em>’s rules are present in the new version.</p>
<p id="XZbEoI">Alongside that reverent attention to the original game rules, Digital Eclipse has inserted a long list of quality-of-life features into its new <em>Wizardry</em>. You can easily put together a party of adventurers with the click of a button — or you can craft your team of fighters, thieves, priests, and mages completely from scratch. There’s a lovely graphical interface that lets you easily jump from the inn, where your characters rest and level up, to the shop, where there’s actual useful information about the weapons and armor you can buy, to the maze, where you’ll do your perilous, first-person dungeon crawling. </p>

<p id="kUgQ1Z"><em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> does a wonderful job of letting players have it both ways; Digital Eclipse lets you choose which streamlining features you want to keep and which you don’t. The remaster even provides the option of different maze layouts, letting you choose between either the PC version or the 8-bit console versions. (You can also opt to see the original Apple II visual running in the corner of the screen, so you can regularly marvel at 40 years of graphical evolution.)</p>
<p id="SE1dqL">During my first playthrough of the remaster, I defaulted to the most streamlined version of <em>Wizardry</em> and soon found that those changes definitely do not make the game a coddling experience. <em>Wizardry</em> remains immensely difficult, even in its new form. I frequently lost members of my party after overextending them by pushing us all further and further into the maze. But the mysteries and chance encounters of <em>Wizardry</em> beckon you to do that — to explore, die, and try again. And maybe recover the corpses of the previous team of unlucky adventurers that you sent to their deaths in the maze earlier in the game.</p>
<p id="FK1Uhh">Digital Eclipse’s <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> is worth playing, particularly if you’re a fan of classic Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games and want to learn more about their inspiration. As part of Digital Eclipse’s growing library of beautifully restored historical games (<em>Atari 50</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/7/3612408/karateka-remake-jordan-mechner-modernize-classic-story"><em>The Making of Karateka</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24101970/llamasoft-jeff-minter-story-review"><em>Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</em></a>), it’s a new way to experience a classic game in a form that was clearly developed with reverence for the source material.</p>

<p>Summertime brings sunshine and opportunities to get outdoors for most people. For players like us, however, it’s a time to sit down in a cool room, shades drawn over the windows, and watch developers and publishers reveal upcoming games and information. To that end, when is Ubisoft Forward?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-ubisoft-forward-event">When is the Ubisoft Forward Event?</h2>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-xbox-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Ubisoft Forward takes place on June 10. You can watch the upcoming gaming event live via broadcast—likely on YouTube and Twitch—with news about upcoming games from the Ubisoft offices worldwide.</p>



<p>While we don’t have much longer to wait for Ubisoft Forward to kick off, we’re not entirely sure what the publisher plans to showcase this year beyond a handful of known projects. Here’s hoping they have a reveal or two to impress the crowd!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-who-is-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-what-will-we-see-at-ubisoft-forward-2024">What Will We See at Ubisoft Forward 2024?</h2>



<p>We know we’ll see a gameplay reveal from Assassin’s Creed Shadows at Ubisoft Forward, alongside more about Star Wars Outlaws, which launches on August 30. However, everything else remains up in the air. There’s no official confirmation about most projects—past, present, or future—but Ubisoft looks to be having a solid year with a handful of releases, and they’ll likely want to capitalize on those.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></li>



<li><strong>XDefiant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rainbow Six: Siege</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skull &amp; Bones</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I hope we get the opportunity to explore upcoming content for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, definitely more about Star Wars Outlaws, and, lastly, a reveal for The Division 3. Unfortunately, I highly doubt we’ll see that last one—not so soon, following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-canceled-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of The Division Heartland</a>!</p>

Otherwise, watch your dice multiplier, changing it as you approach pickup tiles to make the most out of the event.</p>

<p data-characters="508" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The turn structure of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is one of the many key features that set it apart from other TCGs. There are five turn phases within MTG, each with its own steps and restrictions that players must follow. When it isn’t their turn, players can react to their opponents’ spells or trigger abilities that have the potential to drastically change the board. Oftentimes, it can feel like “your” turns aren’t entirely yours– especially when playing against <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained/">those pesky Control decks</a>.</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">This guide will detail the who, what, and when of each phase so that you know what can and can’t be done as both an <strong>Active</strong> and <strong>Non-Active Player</strong>.&nbsp;</p> <div data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false"><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#0-two-important-terms-in-mtg-" data-level="2">Two important terms in MTG</a><ul><li><a href="#1-active-player-priority-" data-level="3">Active Player priority</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-stack-" data-level="3">The Stack</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#3-beginning-phase" data-level="2">Beginning Phase</a><ul><li><a href="#4-untap-step" data-level="3">Untap step</a></li><li><a href="#5-upkeep-step" data-level="3">Upkeep step</a></li><li><a href="#6-draw-step-" data-level="3">Draw step&nbsp;</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#7-first-pre-combat-main-phase" data-level="2">First (Pre-Combat) Main Phase</a></li><li><a href="#8-combat-phase" data-level="2">Combat Phase</a><ul><li><a href="#9-beginning-of-combat" data-level="3">Beginning of Combat</a></li><li><a href="#10-declare-attackers" data-level="3">Declare attackers</a></li><li><a href="#11-declare-blockers" data-level="3">Declare blockers</a></li><li><a href="#12-combat-damage" data-level="3">Combat Damage</a></li><li><a href="#13-end-of-combat" data-level="3">End of Combat</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#14-second-post-combat-main-phase" data-level="2">Second (Post-Combat) Main Phase</a></li><li><a href="#15-ending-phase" data-level="2">Ending Phase</a><ul><li><a href="#16-end-step" data-level="3">End step</a></li><li><a href="#17-cleanup-step" data-level="3">Cleanup step</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#h-mtg-cards-that-interact-with-the-turn-structure" data-level="2">MTG Cards that interact with the turn structure</a></li></ul></div> <h2 id="0-two-important-terms-in-mtg-" data-injectable="false"><strong>Two important terms in MTG</strong></h2> <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Before we dive into the intricacies of each phase of a turn, let’s go over a couple of terms that will make the rest of this guide easier to understand.</p> <h3 id="1-active-player-priority-" data-injectable="false"><strong>Active Player priority</strong></h3> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="820" data-injectable="true">Each turn, the Active Player priority is passed to the player whose turn it is. An easy way to think about Active Player priority is that the Active Player has the “right-of-way.” In MTG, we refer to this prioritization as <strong>APNAP</strong> (Active Player, then Non-Active Player). The Active Player’s actions or triggers during their turn are the first to be included on the <strong>Stack</strong>, followed by the responses and triggers of the Non-Active Players. Priority is passed in this order through all phases of the turn.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="2-the-stack-" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Stack</strong></h3> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">The Stack is often referred to as the most complicated aspect of MTG—I won’t argue with that; it deserves an entire guide of its own. But to understand the various turn phases and steps in MTG, a baseline comprehension of the Stack is all that is necessary.</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"> <li>The Stack is a persistent zone that isn’t physically represented on the board.&nbsp;</li> <li>The Stack’s duty is to maintain the order of the actions so that spells are resolved appropriately. You could think of the Stack as the Order of Operations in math.</li> <li>Active Player priority is an important part of determining how the Stack resolves spells and abilities.</li> <li>Imagining the Stack as a literal stack of the spell cards and abilities played each turn helps simplify the resolution process. </li> </ul>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Many players have experienced a rollercoaster of emotions during the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-devs-provides-update-on-practice-zone-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a></em>&nbsp;end-match achievements. It’s an unusual twist for the achievement, but they’ve made many players (myself included) feel either a genuine sense of pride or outright embarrassment.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">I know it sounds ironic for achievements to be demeaning, but it has to do with how <em>XDefiant</em> handles end-match achievements. Generally, shooter games showcase player stats at the end of the match to show who did the best in-game. However, rather than sticking to the standard shooter achievements like “Most Kills” or “Best K/D Ratio,” <em>XDefiant</em> covers much more than that. </p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">You’ll see plenty of other accomplishments, from the most “Damage Blocked” to the top scorer as an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-all-factions-and-their-abilities-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Echelon Faction</a> member. These rewarding bits bring out the “satisfying” part of the game, where no player can be deemed a loser.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">I’ve particularly enjoyed this when I haven’t been killing too many enemies, focusing solely on a support role as a Libertad. Even when my eliminations have been sub-par, the achievements will at least comfort me with a most “Damage Healed” title. It’s even better when the other players give a thumbs-up to these trophy cards, acting as a victorious virtual high five.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">But <em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;trophies will also make you want to run away in embarrassment after those matches where you just can’t get it right and question if you’re a true FPS player. I’ve experienced this after one of the worst matches of my life. My kills were terrible, I barely healed anyone, and I almost died every other minute. The end-game achievement of “Helped” feels like a participation trophy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">What I actually “Helped” with remains a mystery to me. Yet, I couldn’t help but laugh at my not-so-great achievement. I’ve also gotten one for the most LMG kills, which may sound impressive, except I only got&nbsp;six&nbsp;kills that match. The other players that round had more than 24 eliminations, so six kills sounds like child’s play at that point.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Fortunately, I’m not the only one getting these hysterical trophies. Reddit user Vince_- experienced this when they were rewarded with a “Ran Around” accomplishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">Although it sounds pointless, it’s better than getting a “Hey, you suck” title. There are a few funny achievements, too; some of my personal&nbsp;favorites are “Moral Support” and “Tried.” I’ve always liked the saying “A for effort,” which definitely translates well in the world of&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">Other players on Reddit have found the reward system exceptionally comical. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cxjxp6/comment/l56foib/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One player</a> mentioned how their entire group laughed when someone on the team got a “Showed Up” title after joining the round late. I like to see this&nbsp;type of&nbsp;camaraderie as it strays away from the relatively toxic side of shooters. I’ve run into that during some bad matches, and let me tell you, it can be brutal. Fortunately, <em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;seems much more inviting, especially with its more player-friendly <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a> mechanics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant’s</em>&nbsp;match conclusions are a mixed bag of emotions but in a good way. Sometimes, you’ll be on top of the world in a specific category, while other times, you may feel like a chump who only got a trophy for being there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">It’s a rollercoaster, but I’m enjoying the ride. It’s exciting to see things done this way instead of feeling like I’ll never reach the scope of the pros. It also adds humor to the game, an element that can often be left out in shooter games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">For the first time ever, I want to perform poorly in matches just to see what other humiliating achievements I can earn. It’s different, sure, but I’m glad that Ubisoft has the sense of humor to make the game much more entertaining.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">Unique content like this may have contributed to its popularity surge.&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>has even reportedly become <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-becomes-fastest-ubisoft-title-reach-one-million-unique-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of Ubisoft’s fastest-growing</a> titles yet. Hopefully, more games will learn from <em>XDdefiant</em>‘s tongue-in-cheek achievements as a way to make a match feel more fun by having a surprise waiting for players at the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can anything stop the meteoric rise of Fortnite? Even after all these years, the Fortnite Battle Royale continues to entice players and rake in cash for its developers, primarily thanks to strategic partnerships and skin pack launches. The most recent one appears to combine the social horror game Lethal Company with Fortnite!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-we-get-lethal-company-skins-in-fortnite">Will We Get Lethal Company Skins in Fortnite?</h2>



<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-lethal-company-collaboration-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent tease</a>, which revealed an upcoming skin and emote, we know that Lethal Company is, in fact, coming to Fortnite. More specifically, we’ll see “The Employee” skin in Fortnite, the stock player character outfit from the four-player horror game that took the world by storm in October 2023.</p>



<p>Alongside The Employee, we’ll also receive oxygen tanks and a stop sign, likely as a melee weapon and some tool, as part of the Lethal Company x Fortnite crossover event. But that’s not all because the “Company Jig” emote also joins the party in the battle royale world.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-lethal-company-coming-to-fortnite">When is Lethal Company Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>While there is no official release date for the crossover event, it’s most likely to occur during Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3. Of course, there’s no telling. We could see a delay in the crossover event until a later season or a new chapter altogether, but that seems unlikely, considering the quality of the leak in question.</p>



<p>Following the immense success of Lethal Company, which brought in nearly $100 million for its one-person developer, Zeekerss, it’s no surprise to anyone here at Insider Gaming that we’d see a crossover event like this. It was only a matter of time!</p>

<p data-characters="134" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re after a relic weapon in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and don’t mind a grind, then you might want to go after a Zodiac weapon.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Make no mistake, this Relic carries arguably the most arduous grind of any Relic in <em>FFXIV</em>, but they are glorious to look at and, as a bonus, come with the &lt;Z&gt; title. You’ll need to be prepared for a lot of hard work if you want a Zodiac weapon, but if you’re up for the challenge, let’s look at the steps in detail.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Before you can begin the Zodiac grind, you’ll need to have completed a few things:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Complete the level 50 MSQ quest “The Ultimate Weapon”</li> <li>Complete all Class and Job quests for your chosen job including the level 30 quest which gives you the Job Stone</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-weaponsmith-of-legend-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete The Weaponsmith of Legend in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">You’ll only need to complete this quest before you begin your first Zodiac weapon grind. When beginning additional weapons, you’ll skip over this one.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">Head to Vesper Bay and talk to Nedrick Ironheart (X:12.0, Y:14.0). He’ll send you off to Mor Dhona to speak to Rowena (X:22.0, Y:6.0), before you’ll head to Hyrstmill in North Shroud to see Gerolt (X:30.0, Y:20.0).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">This final location will be the main go-to point for the entire Zodiac grind, so you’ll get pretty good at finding it quickly.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-a-relic-reborn-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete A Relic Reborn in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="157" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Unfinished</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="88" data-current-count="88" data-injectable="false">This quest has a lot of different steps, each of which requires some effort to complete:</p> <h4 id="h-step-one-finding-your-broken-weapon" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step one: Finding your broken weapon.&nbsp;</strong></h4> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Where you need to go to find your broken weapon depends on which job you’re trying to get a Zodiac weapon for. Broken weapons are spread between the various A Realm Reborn Beastmen Strongholds:</p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="823" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Job</strong></td><td><strong>Weapon co-ordinates</strong></td><td><strong>Beastmen Stronghold</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Paladin<br>Monk</td><td>(X:30.0, Y:19.0)<br>(X:32.0, Y:18.0)</td><td>Zahar’ak (Southern Thanalan)</td></tr><tr><td>Warrior<br>Black Mage<br>White Mage</td><td>(X:23.0, Y:10.0)<br>(X:23.0, Y:11.0)<br>(X:24.3, Y:6.4)</td><td>U’Ghamaro Mines (Outer La Noscea)</td></tr><tr><td>Dragoon<br>Bard</td><td>(X:34.0, Y:21.0)<br>(X:34.9, Y:20.5)</td><td>Natalan (Central Coerthas Highlands)</td></tr><tr><td>Ninja<br>Scholar</td><td>(X:16.0, Y:17.0)<br>(X:15.5, Y:16.9)</td><td>Sapsa Spawning Grounds (Western La Noscea)</td></tr><tr><td>Summoner</td><td>(X:25.0, Y:19.0)</td><td>Sylphlands (East Shroud)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-two-attach-materia-to-a-weapon" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step two: Attach materia to a weapon</strong></h4> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">To complete this step, you’ll need to either craft or purchase a specific weapon for your chosen class, then purchase two of a specific low level materia to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-meld-and-overmeld-in-ffxiv-including-pentameld/">meld</a> onto it. You can either meld the materia yourself, or pay a Materia Melder NPC to do this for you.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="59" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">Here’s the weapon and materia you’ll need for each Job:</p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="867" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Job</strong></td><td><strong>Weapon needed</strong></td><td><strong>Materia needed</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Paladin<br>Warrior</td><td>Aeolian Scimitar<br>Barbarian’s Bardiche</td><td>Battledance Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>Dragoon<br>Monk</td><td>Champion’s Lance<br>Wildling’s Cesti</td><td>Savage Aim Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>Ninja<br>Bard</td><td>Vamper’s Knives<br>Longarm’s Composite Bow</td><td>Heavens’ Eye Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>Black Mage<br>Summoner</td><td>Sanguine Scepter<br>Erudite’s Picatrix of Casting</td><td>Savage Might Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>White Mage<br>Scholar</td><td>Madman’s Whispering Rod<br>Erudite’s Picatrix of Healing</td><td>Quicktongue Materia III</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-three-getting-alumina-salts" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step three: Getting Alumina Salts</strong></h4> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">This one’s easy, especially if you’re going into this on a level 90 Job. You’ll need to complete A Relic Reborn: The Chimera, which is a level 50 Trial. However, it can be easily completed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-enter-dungeon-solo-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">unsynced</a> within a few seconds solo with any level 90 Job.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">To enter A Relic Reborn for the first time, you’ll need to head to Coerthas Central Highlands to find the entrance (X:32.0, Y6.0). For any additional weapons, you’ll be able to access this trial through the Duty Finder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed the Trial you’ll be rewarded with some Alumina Salts. With these in hand, head back to Gerolt in Hyrstmill.&nbsp;</p> <h4 id="h-step-four-getting-an-amdapor-glyph" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step four: Getting an Amdapor Glyph</strong></h4> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Again, this is a relatively easy step. All you need to do is complete the level 50 dungeon Amdapor Keep in order to get an Amdapor Glyph. Thankfully, as long as you complete the dungeon as your chosen Job, you can do it unsynced, so this is another step you can complete very quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve got the Glyph, take it back to Rowena in Mor Dhona and then revisit Gerolt in Hyrstmill.&nbsp;</p> <h4 id="h-step-five-hunt-some-beastmen" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step five: Hunt some Beastmen</strong></h4> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">At this point, Gerolt will have given you an unfinished Zodiac weapon. You’ll now need to equip and go hunting for Beastmen. Again, which Beastmen you need to defeat depends on the Job you’re trying to get a Zodiac weapon for, but they’re in the same area as where you found your broken weapon in step one:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Job</strong></td><td><strong>Enemy 1</strong></td><td><strong>Enemy 2</strong></td><td><strong>Enemy 3</strong></td><td><strong>Location</strong></td></tr><tr><td>PaladinMonk</td><td>8 Zahar’ak Lancer</td><td>8 Zahar’ak Pugilist</td><td>8 Zahar’ak Thaumaturge</td><td>Zahar’akSouthern Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>WarriorBlack MageWhite Mage</td><td>8 U’Ghamaro Quarryman</td><td>8 U’Ghamaro Bedesman</td><td>8 U’Ghamaro Priest</td><td>U’Ghamaro MinesOuter La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>DragoonBard</td><td>8 Natalan Boldwing</td><td>8 Natalan Fogcaller</td><td>8 Natalan Windtalon</td><td>NatalanCoerthas Central Highlands</td></tr><tr><td>NinjaScholar</td><td>8 Sapsa Shelfspine</td><td>8 Sapsa Shelfclaw</td><td>8 Sapsa Shelftooth</td><td>Sapsa Spawning GroundsWestern La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Summoner</td><td>8 Violet Sigh</td><td>8 Violet Screech</td><td>8 Violet Snarl</td><td>SylphlandsEast Shroud</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-six-complete-some-trials" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step six: Complete some Trials</strong></h4> <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">You’ll need to complete four different Trials in order to complete this step. The first of these needs unlocking – A Relic Reborn: The Hydra.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Like A Relic Reborn: The Chimera, you’ll need to physically go to the entrance location for this Trial the first time you complete this step. The entrance is located in Eastern Thanalan, directly next to the entrance to Halatali (X:14.0, Y:30.0). This step needs to be completed with the unfinished Zodiac weapon equipped, but can be completed unsynced. When complete, return to Gerolt.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">After that, Gerolt will send you into three Trials one by one to obtain their quest specific drops, talking to him again between each Trial. You do not need to have the unfinished Zodiac weapon equipped to complete these trials, but you do still need to complete them as you chosen Job:</p> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Trial</strong></td><td><strong>Drop</strong></td></tr><tr><td>The Bowl of Embers (Hard)</td><td>White Hot Ember</td></tr><tr><td>The Howling Eye (Hard)</td><td>Howling Gale</td></tr><tr><td>The Navel (Hard)</td><td>Hyperfused Ore</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-seven-get-some-radz-at-han-quenching-oil" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step seven: Get some Radz-at-Han Quenching Oil</strong></h4> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">Radz-at-Han Quenching Oil can be purchased from Auriana in Mor Dhona (X:22.7, Y:6.6) for 15 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-should-you-do-with-tomestones-of-poetics-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">Tomestones of Poetics</a> each. You only need one and then you can return to Gerolt to finish this first quest of the Zodiac grind.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-upgrade-to-a-zenith-zodiac-weapon-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to upgrade to a Zenith Zodiac weapon in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic Stage: Zenith</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">Unlike any other steps in Zodiac grind, this one involves no quests (yay!). This is a really easy step and all you need is 60 Tomestones of Poetics to purchase 3 Thavnairian Mist. These can be purchased from Auriana in Mor Dhona.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve got them, take them to the Furnace in Hyrstmill and combine the Mists with your weapon. Ta da!</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-up-in-arms-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Up in Arms in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Atma</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">For this next step, you’re going to have to complete a lot of FATEs. And I do mean a lot.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">After speaking to Gerold, he’ll send you to Jalzahn (located very closeby) and he will tell you that you now need to collect 12 Atmas, each of which drop from FATEs completed in specific areas. However, these Atmas have an abysmally low drop rate even today so this step might take you a while to complete. You’ll need to complete these FATEs with your Zenith weapon equipped.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">As soon as you talk to Jalzahn, this quest will be marked as completed whether you have collected the Atma or not. Keep track of them by organizing your inventory. If this isn’t your first Zodiac grind, you do not need to talk to Jalzahn this first time and can immediately progress to collecting Atmas.</p> <p data-characters="55" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Here’s all the different Atmas and where to get them:</p> <figure data-found-rows="13" data-current-count="1180" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Atma</strong></td><td><strong>FATEs zone</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Lion</td><td>Outer La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Water-bearer</td><td>Upper La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Ram</td><td>Middle La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Crab</td><td>Western La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Fish</td><td>Lower La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Bull</td><td>Eastern Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Scales</td><td>Central Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Twins</td><td>Western Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Scorpion</td><td>Southern Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Archer</td><td>North Shroud</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Goat</td><td>East Shroud</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Maiden</td><td>Central Shroud</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve collected your Atmas, head back to Jalzahn and hand them back to him. He’ll upgrade your weapon to the Atma stage.</p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">As a side note, if you happen to end up with extra Atmas from any area (if you’re doing this grind with a friend, for instance) I strongly recommend keeping them somewhere. You never know when they’re going to come in handy.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-trials-of-the-braves-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Trials of the Braves in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Animus</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">Even I have to admit that this is the stage that causes people to take a break or give up the Zodiac grind altogether — the dreaded Books.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">With your Atma Zodiac weapon equipped, talk to Jalzahn and he will explain that you need to recreate ‘valorous deeds’ of the Zodiac Braves. In order to do this, you’ll need to complete objectives set out in 9 books with your Atma weapon equipped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Head to Mor Dhona and talk to Rowena first, then to G’jusana, who is also in Mor Dhona (X:22.9, Y:7.3).

<p>Countless Call of Duty fans have yet to upgrade their systems, and there’s nothing wrong with that. The last generation of consoles—PlayStation 4 and Xbox One—were fantastic and often much cheaper than current-gen systems. But you also don’t want to miss out on the upcoming Call of Duty game. So, can you play Black Ops 6 on PS4?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-coming-to-ps4">Is Black Ops 6 Coming to PS4?</h2>



<p>While we heard rumors last year regarding the next Call of Duty game launching on current-gen and last-gen systems, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we can </a>confirm that Black Ops 6 is coming to PS4. It’s coming to most systems, including PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, in October 2024.</p>



<p>The Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S versions of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will offer cross-generation support, meaning you buy a single copy of the game, and it works on both systems, but PlayStation won’t offer the same compatibility. There are product listings at GameStop for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 copies.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-cross-platform">Is Black Ops 6 Cross Platform?</h2>



<p>While we don’t yet have an official word regarding cross-platform support for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, it’s likely happening. Past titles in the long-running first-person shooter franchise have featured crossplay and cross-platform features from day one. </p>



<p>Furthermore, with Black Ops 6 releasing on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft and Activision want to ensure the widest reach possible. They want everyone in the first-person shooter scene to play this release later this year, and that means providing full lobbies of competitive players. Cross-platform between all five systems is a must-have feature to accomplish this task!</p>



<hr>



<p>Most long-time Call of Duty fans want something to help ease the wait until the next game, like XDefiant. But does it offer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-xdefiant-have-search-and-destroy-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Search and Destroy</a>? Oh, by the way, we’d love to have you join us by signing up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

I read all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">glowing</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch">reviews</a> of the game and heard the breathless praise heaped upon it on social media. But my expectations did not match my reality... until I beat the game. Now, I’m well on my way to 100 percent completion for a game I was seriously considering abandoning.</p><p><strong><em>Spoilers for</em> Animal Well<em> are below.</em></strong></p><p>Though I loved <em>Animal Well</em>’s novel take on traditional movement abilities — the tools it provides possess multiple clever uses — platforming itself often felt demoralizing. Initially, <em>Animal Well</em>’s platforming felt like it had difficulty spikes that were both too great and too frequent. I could often see where I had to go and how to get there (and I often looked up video guides to confirm I was doing it right with the right tools) but actually executing was more laborious than fun and engaging. </p><div><p>Though I loved <em>Animal Well</em>’s novel take on traditional movement abilities, platforming itself often felt demoralizing</p></div><p>I’ve always felt that the difficulty of a task in a platformer should be commensurate with its importance: the hardest moments should be reserved for secrets and optional goals, while everything involved in completing the game should be more attainable. That way, I am still in control of my experience and, critically, still <em>having</em> an experience. If reaching a secret is harder than I’d like, then I can opt out to continue on to beat the game one completion percentage point lower. But if simply getting from point A to point B is too dang hard, opting out means opting out of the game entirely. <em>Animal Well</em>’s platforming convinced me I’d run into an obstacle so frustratingly difficult that I’d quit and never come back.</p><div><figcaption><em>On a lark, I decided to see what would happen if I pressed a big red skull button in a room full of crows, and yup, they pecked me to death.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Big Mode / Shared Memory</cite></p></div><p>Thankfully, that didn’t happen. Somehow, I persisted long enough to collect all four animal flames to complete the game’s first “ending,” figuring I’d stop there. But then, right before the final encounter, I found a room littered with skulls containing an upgrade to the bubble wand item. Remember this, it’ll be important in a moment.</p><p>The bubble wand creates little bubble platforms you can jump on, but you can only blow one at a time. The upgraded bubble wand allows you to blow <em>multiple</em> bubbles that, with the right technique, let you bypass a lot of the game’s obstacles. </p><p>Remember the skulls? I figured out that all the skulls in that room, piled high enough for me to reach the wand, represented the number of times I died. With that realization came the shock that even though I wasn’t initially vibing with the game, it was always vibing with me. The bubble wand upgrade is unreachable unless you’ve accumulated enough skulls to build a platform up to it. The only way I got what finally made this game click for me was because of all the frustration it put me through in the first place.</p><p>When I figured that out, I started laughing maniacally, tears in my eyes, thinking, “Oh, you cheeky bastards!” I immediately went right back to the start of the game to go egg hunting, something I already decided I wasn’t going to do. But I was locked in now. I understood. I’m stuck in the (animal) well now, and I’m never coming out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="edsBx5">This month, we have two very different thrillers — one about corporate malfeasance, one about an evil box — an underrated video game adaptation, and a very silly comedy with a great cast. We’re also highlighting <em>The Crow</em>, with the new version starring Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs just a few months away.</p>
<p id="TQm1uj">Here are the best movies you should watch before they leave streaming this May.</p>

<p id="Kog0AX"><strong>Director: </strong>Michael Mann<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer<br><strong>Leaving Criterion Channel: </strong>May 31</p>
<p id="rgji44">In 1996, <em>60 Minutes </em>ran a searing episode exposing the tobacco industry for intentionally adding dangerous chemicals to cigarettes and lying to the public. The episode relied on the testimony of whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, the former vice president of research and development at a major tobacco company. And the story behind how that episode came to be (and how it nearly never aired) is fascinating, as documented in Michael Mann’s excellent thriller <em>The Insider</em>.</p>
<p id="2IpgEb">A powerful movie about the difficulties of working ethically inside a large corporation and what real heroism actually looks like, <em>The Insider </em>is one of Mann’s very best movies — and that’s an extremely high bar. Al Pacino and Russell Crowe star as CBS producer Lowell Bergman and the whistleblower Wigand, respectively, and the excellent supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (as legendary <em>60 Minutes </em>correspondent Mike Wallace), Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, and Rip Torn. It’s a gorgeous movie to take in as well, with crisp cinematography from Dante Spinotti earning him one of the movie’s seven Oscar nominations — including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and the first of three consecutive Best Actor nominations for Crowe. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="XH0qEW"><strong>Director: </strong>Christophe Gans<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden<br><strong>Leaving Netflix: </strong>May 31</p>
<p id="9VjPbc">This movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23411610/silent-hill-movie-new-game-announcement">doesn’t get the credit it deserves</a>. Not only is it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23196727/best-video-game-movies-adaptations-tv-watch-streaming">one of the best video game movies ever made</a>, it’s also a very creepy (and gory) horror movie that does a great job of capturing the games’ mounting existential dread. You already know the premise: A girl gets lost in Silent Hill and someone else has to go rescue her, only to find all manner of untold horrors within the abandoned town. While there are bits and pieces of CGI that don’t quite hold up, the rest of this movie includes some truly terrifying creatures and sequences, and an absolutely devastating ending that few horror movies can match. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="ZQaJ91">There’s a new adaptation of <em>The Crow </em>coming around the corner this summer, so why not watch the original this month? While best known for the tragic death of star Brandon Lee, who was fatally shot in an accident during production, <em>The Crow </em>is an enduring neo-(goth-)noir classic for good reason. With a foreboding atmosphere via director Alex Proyas (<em>Dark City</em>) and the (very) dark source material, <em>The Crow </em>inspired a whole generation of goths.</p>
<p id="4eltkw">And if you love Brandon Lee in this, check out some of the other movies in his all-too-short filmography. His previous two movies — <em>Showdown in Little Tokyo </em>and <em>Rapid Fire </em>— are both stellar. Like his father, he was one hell of a movie star whose life and career was cut all too short. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="MrYfe9">I have a vivid memory of <em>The Box </em>being marketed as a horror movie, but it really isn’t. After falling head over heels for his <em>Southland Tales </em>(and with <em>Donnie Darko </em>under my belt long before that), I wanted to complete my experience with the Richard Kelly filmography with his most recent feature, which was broadly rejected by critics and audiences alike but is nonetheless a fascinating movie. And I was rewarded for that decision, albeit with some qualms.</p>
<p id="oDtuhi">You know the basic premise. It’s been memed to death — a family receives a button that will give them a million dollars if they press it, but someone they don’t know will die. But that basic premise hides a much richer movie, a tense domestic drama that unwinds into a conspiracy thriller turned [redacted for spoilers]. Like Kelly’s other movies, <em>The Box </em>is filled with interesting images and is ripe for all sorts of metaphorical readings, even if it is less successful than his two previous features. I found myself quite frustrated with the ending, especially with regard to its relationship to disability, but it’s a fascinating and endlessly discussable thriller nonetheless. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="Lv0L5o"><strong>Director: </strong>Kay Cannon<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kathryn Newton, John Cena, Leslie Mann<br><strong>Leaving Hulu: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD%2frLJHOac&amp;offerid=1589248.1409&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">May 31</a></p>
<p id="6AXDM6">A hybrid sex comedy/generation-gap comedy from <em>30 Rock </em>alum Kay Cannon, <em>Blockers </em>follows three parents who are trying to stop their daughters from losing their virginity on prom night... and also the three daughters trying to lose their virginity on prom night. It’s not nearly as conservative about young women having sex as the premise might have you believe, as the parents’ ridiculous overprotectiveness is often the butt of the joke, but the real strength is the cast: rising stars Kathryn Newton, Geraldine Viswanathan, and Gideon Adlon excel as the three main girls, while Leslie Mann, John Cena, and Ike Barinholtz are all great as the overbearing parents.</p>
<p id="d2HAjy">Often juvenile and not always funny, <em>Blockers </em>isn’t some great breakthrough moment in American comedy, but it is a fun time with a very game cast. The split between the parents and the children and their various problems and hang-ups is almost like an American version of <em>Derry Girls</em>. While <em>Blockers </em>lacks the emotional resonance of that Netflix show, it’s still an underrated Hollywood comedy during an era where very few of those have been worth talking about. —<em>PV </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-black-ops-6-on-xbox-one-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>These days, we don’t see many brand-new launches on last-gen systems. Most developers chose to forego the system in favor of new tech, like the current-gen Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. There are also rumors about the next generation of gaming consoles coming sometime in the next year or two. That said, not everyone feels the same. So, can you play Black Ops 6 on Xbox One?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-coming-to-xbox-one">Is Black Ops 6 Coming to Xbox One?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent reports online</a>, specifically surrounding product listings at GameStop, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is indeed coming to Xbox One. It will launch on last-gen and current-gen systems, along with PC, to reach the widest audience imaginable.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming heard rumors regarding Black Ops 6 on last-gen consoles in February last year, but we can only now confirm those rumors. We have confirmation from developers and retailers, which is fantastic news for anyone playing on Xbox One or PlayStation 4!</p>



<p>Furthermore, it’s important to note that you won’t find a direct listing for Black Ops 6 on Xbox One. Instead, it falls under the Xbox Series X|S version because it’s a cross-generation copy of the game, meaning it works on both systems!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-crossplay">Does Black Ops 6 Have Crossplay?</h2>



<p>If past titles are anything to go by, then yes, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will feature crossplay. Honestly, it’s nearly a must-have feature for a first-person, lobby-based shooter launching on all available systems.</p>



<p>We don’t have exact numbers, but we know the Xbox One sold approximately 58 million units, while the Xbox Series X|S sold 21 million units, give or take. That’s a massive gap in the player base, meaning most didn’t upgrade. It would be foolish of Activision to split the communities so significantly on last-gen and current-gen systems!</p>



<hr>



<p>While we’re all casually waiting for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, did you hear about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>?

            <p>The families of those killed in the Uvalde school shooting in 2022 have filed lawsuits against Call of Duty publisher Activision, accusing the company of "grooming" the 18-year-old who shot and killed 19 children, two teachers, and injured 17 others.</p>
<p>As reported by The New York Times (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/us/uvalde-gun-instagram-activision-lawsuit.html">£</a>) (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/uvalde-activision-lawsuit/">PC Gamer</a>), the dual lawsuits – one filed in California, the other in Texas – claim that the killer bought a Daniel Defense M4 V7 on his 18th birthday after seeing the gun in Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>It's the lawsuits' position that by using real-life weapons, Activision is "the most prolific and effective marketer of assault weapons in the United States". </p>
<p>They also take issue with Meta's Instagram and the arms manufacturer, Daniel Defense, too, saying that were it not for technology and video games, the socially isolated teenager living in rural Texas would not have been able to contact the gun maker.</p>
<p>Activision says that whilst it shares its "deepest sympathies" to all those impacted by the mass shooting, "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".</p>
<p>The Entertainment Software Association – the video game trade body that representations video game companies in the US and established the ESRB ratings association in the early 1990s – calls the lawsuits "baseless".</p>
<p>"We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," the ESA said in a statement to press. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies. Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence."</p>
<p>We've reached out to Activision for further comment and will update you if/when we receive a formal response.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/25/a-new-astro-bot-rumoured-to-be-announced-soon-astros-playroom-sequel/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> game could be announced in the next two weeks, as rumours emerge for Sony’s expected summer showcase.</p>
<p>This comes from the very, very reliable games industry leaker Billbil-kun, writing on <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489">French deals site Dealabs</a>. They have a remarkable track record of predicting announcements, typically revealing the monthly PlayStation Plus games just a little before Sony make the formal announcement.</p>


<p>A new Astro Bot game has been mooted by industry insider Jeff Grubb earlier this year, and it absolutely follows that Team Asobi would make a new Astro Bot game after the success and popularity of Astro Bot: Rescue Mission on the original PSVR and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astros-playroom">Astro’s Playroom</a>, which is bundled in with every PlayStation 5 as a showcase of the console’s capabilities and love letter to all things PlayStation.</p>
<p>Team Asobi spawned out of Japan Studio, having been founded as an internal team at the studio back in 2012. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/25/report-playstations-japan-studio-is-being-wound-down-but-astros-playroom-developer-asobi-team-will-survive/">Sony’s decision to shut down Japan Studio in early 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/03/astro-bot-developer-team-asobi-is-now-a-standalone-studio-separate-from-japan-studio/">Team Asobi was splintered off as a standalone studio</a> within PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>So when, exactly, will Astro Bot’s next adventure be announced? Well, Sony has yet to confirm a State of Play or PlayStation Showcase, but they typically do hold an online showcase around this time of year. With Summer Game Fest now settled into the old E3 window of early June, Sony stole a march last year with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/17/playstation-showcase-announced-for-24th-may-2023/">a PlayStation Showcase on 24th May</a>. The latest rumours and speculation – coming from Jeff Grubb and Nick Baker – suggest an event could happen as soon as next week, 28th May. Except, Sony gave one week’s notice last time around and have been completely silent on the matter.</p>

<p>Astro’s Playroom was a simple bundle of joy for pretty much every PS5 owner. “Astro cements himself as the PlayStation 5’s mascot,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">I said in 2020</a>, “with a celebration of all things PlayStation that also showcases the full potential of the immersive new DualSense controller. Astro’s Playroom is the first thing you should play on PlayStation 5.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-reboots-both-underperform-for-embracer.881406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-reboots-both-underperform-for-embracer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two big game series revivals have underperformed, Embracer Group has said, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alone-in-the-dark">Alone in the Dark</a> reboot and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/outcast-a-new-beginning">Outcast: A New Beginning</a> sequel both selling worse than expected.</p>
<p>As part of Embracer’s latest earnings report for the year ending in March 2024, the company noted that the survival horror reboot failed to sell in line with expectations, and the sequel to 1999 cult classic Outcast faced similar struggles. Both games came under the THQ Nordic brand, but have impacted the wider finances of the troubled company.</p>


<p>Other games did, however, meet or exceed expectations. Despite server issues at launch, Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection sold well, and South Park: Snow Day also “delivered within expectations”. Even better, Embracer said that&nbsp;Tomb Raider I-III Remasted “was positively received and performed above management expectations.”</p>
<p>Alone in the Dark had some moderately high hopes pinned upon it, with Pieces Interactive taking the early 90s survival horror pioneer and promising a Resident Evil 2 Remake style makeover. It featured Jodie Comer and Dariv Harbour in leading roles, while reimagining the setting and story.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it just didn’t deliver. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">our Alone in the Dark review</a>, we said, “Alone in the Dark haphazardly follows modern genre trends where it once invented them. While it mostly succeeds at drawing players into a Lovecraftian mystery, it’s hard to ignore the underbaked action elements used to patch these story beats together.”</p>

<p>Embracer has gone from a growing force in gaming to a troubled company in just over a year. Having acquired a huge number of studios and publishing labels, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/14/embracer-will-shut-studios-and-cancel-games-after-2bn-deal-falls-apart/">company has enacted sweeping layoffs and redundancies</a>, cancelled games, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">sold</a> or shuttered studios. Most recently, it was announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/22/embracer-group-plans-to-split-into-three-separate-companies/">Embracer will split into three separate entities</a>. This latest news and underperforming games in general certainly won’t help…</p>

            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios has shared the "disappointing news" that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-xbox-physical-edition-gets-a-bit-of-a-delay-due-to-production-issues">physical PS5 North America deluxe editions have been delayed once again</a>, this time to July 2024.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, last night, the team said it was "so hoping not to have to update [...] with any further news of delay", but it had "run into more production issues", further delaying the shipping of physical copies of the North American PS5 version until later this year.</p>

<p>"Due to production changes outside of our control, we have had to follow certain processes specifically set by production companies when manufacturing the PS5 discs, and unfortunately, the approval for particular regions has taken much longer than expected," Larian explained in the statement.</p>
<p>"We expect all PS5 North America copies to be ready in around 14 days - followed by another 10 days to begin delivering these directly to players. We are also in talks with the manufacturer to understand whether it is possible to hire extra temporary staff to reduce assembly times.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We have disappointing news to share with you.</p><p>While we were so hoping to not have to update owners of the console physical Deluxe Edition with any further news of delay, we’ve now run into more production issues which means that players who pre-ordered their PS5 North America…</p></div>— Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1794059975746105362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Knowing that there are some of you still waiting to play Baldur’s Gate 3, despite the fact we are unable to substitute physical goods with digital versions, we can only deeply apologise that your preorders have again been delayed," the statement concluded. "By committing to creating physical editions, we were hoping to preserve the almost nostalgic feeling of unboxing your newest game, and this is a commitment we’re hoping to bring into the future with us, this time ensuring we continue to work closely with our partners to manage the planning and production process.</p>
<p>"We’re so sorry it’s taking so long to get your preorder to you, and thank you, for continuing to support us."</p>
<p>The team was able to confirm, however, that Xbox copies are now shipping, as are PS5 versions in the EU and Oceania.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed its next game will not be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, DLC, or anything else to do with Dungeons and Dragons, but did have other games in development.</p>
<p>Back in April, the studio said it was still "early days" for these projects, with CEO Swen Vincke stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">what's coming will be the team's "best work ever"</a>. An exciting claim given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">monumental success of Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>As for a potential Baldur's Gate 4? Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">recently confirmed</a> it's "talking to lots of partners" about a new game in the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The free-to-play first-person shooter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-release-date-preseason-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDefiant</a> is reportedly doing big numbers already. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Tom Henderson</a>, the game has become the fastest ever made by Ubisoft to surpass one million unique players. In fact, it has already managed to break through the three million unique player milestone.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that XDefiant is currently outperforming even Ubisoft's rosiest expectations. However, the big question with a live service game like this is whether it can retain players' interest over time. While Call of Duty Modern Warfare III has certainly underwhelmed, the same might not be true for 2024's title, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just been confirmed to be Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft already shared the game's Year 1 roadmap, which will see the introduction of ranked mode and private matches, new arena and progression modes, a welcome list for beginners, practice zones, and ongoing anti-cheat improvements. There will also be four seasons, each coming with three new weapons, three new maps, 90 tiers of Battle Pass, and a new faction. The four factions being added in Year 1 are codenamed Ruby, Buzz, Orchard, and Horde.</p>
<p>For now, the game includes the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 maps inspired by other Ubisoft titles</li>
<li>Five Ubisoft franchise-inspired factions (one faction to be earned or purchased): Cleaners from The Division, Libertad from Far Cry, Echelon from Splinter Cell, Phantoms from Ghost Recon, and Dedsec from Watch Dogs</li>
<li>24 weapons</li>
<li>44 attachments</li>
<li>Five devices</li>
<li>Two game modes: Arena and Linear</li>
<li>Arena includes Domination, where teams fight to control three fixed zones; Occupy, in which teams fight to control one zone that periodically moves around the map; and HotShot, where players fight to get the most KOs.</li>
<li>Linear includes Zone Control, where the attacking team works to secure five zones in a progression across the map while defenders must fight to stop them, and Escort, where the attacking team must bring a package to its final destination across the map while the defenders attempt to stymie their progress, and even push the package back.</li>
</ul>
<p>XDefiant also encountered some of the usual launch title snags, such as server issues, although the developers appear to be on top of that.</p>
<p>Have you been playing this game yet? If so, what do you think of it?</p>

The reaction has now prompted Druckmann to correct the record.</p><p>“This is not quite what I said,” the veteran gaming creative tweeted late on May 24. “In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost. Well, here’s the full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game.”</p><p>Druckmann then proceeded to share an excerpt of the raw, unedited transcript from his conversation with the anonymous interviewer. In it, he talks about how gaming used to be very niche and siloed off from the rest of the culture when he was growing up, and how that has since changed, in part thanks to hit TV shows like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070">HBO’s adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s adaptation of <em>Fallout</em></a></span>. </p><p>“I’m not only excited for this game that we’re making—and it’s, it’s something really fresh for us—but I’m also excited to see how the world reacts to it,” the transcript reads. “Because of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and the success of the show, people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next. I’m very excited to see what the reaction for this thing will be.”</p><p>While interviews are often edited down for clarity and length, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the one published on Sony’s website</a></span> made a surprising number of cuts and, what’s worse, made up a bunch of things Druckmann didn’t actually say, including phrases with very different meanings from anything contained in the original. It raises the question of how many other parts of the interview aren’t accurate paraphrases of what the game designer said or are completely made-up, though presumably if there were more errors Druckmann would have corrected those as well. </p><p>One thing that Sony cut from his response was a moment of humility and graciousness. “I’ve been very lucky to have worked on my favorite games with incredible collaborators and I’m very thankful for them,” Druckmann said. It was a tacit reminder that Naughty Dog’s games are made by hundreds of people.</p><p>Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It offers a sneak peek into the world of the game… but in order to let more players get their hands on the actual game experience, <em>Blade Chimera</em> will be joining Steam Next Fest in June (next month!) with a public demo. Please check out the demo too when it releases!</p><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Blade-Chimera_2024_05-25-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Play as Shin, a Demon Hunter who has lost his memories and is now exploring the world together with his sword—the transformed Lumina demon Lux—recollecting memories about yourself, your missing wife, and skills you’ve forgotten.</p><p>Each time you recollect a lost skill, Lux changes form according to the will of her wielder, making Shin stronger and granting access to more areas of the world.</p><p><strong>The Story</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Blade-Chimera_2024_05-25-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>The game takes place in the near future, where warped monsters and ghouls have appeared from nowhere, swarming cities and forcing humans to battle against these creatures they’ve termed “demons” in an all-out Demon War. After 30 merciless years of war, the surviving humans have banded together under the Missa Association, a religious group formed by a leader who knows the secret to fighting the demons. Cities and civilizations continue to thrive despite the now regular sightings of bizarre monsters.</p><p>Three years ago, a man known as Shin was rescued from among the rubble in a cryopreserved state. With no recollection of his past, he quickly becomes one of the association’s best warriors and protectors.</p><p>However, when Shin comes across the brilliantly beautiful demon named Lux, she feels strangely familiar. This sensation of deja vu leads him to take her in, even if it means going against the creeds of the association.</p><p>From that very instant, the past begins to slowly unfold, revealing the events that caused the city to take on its current form…</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Watch beautifully animated conversations between the main characters. Join a young boy on his adventure and experience his story set in a hardcore sci-fi world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Boyhood’s End</em> is a juvenile science fiction horror adventure game, in which the world is ruled by a mechanical overlord “R. Karellen.” Every aspect of every person’s life is rated with a “human score,” and R. Karellen decides everything from academic and professional careers, romantic interests, to one’s daily meals.</p><p>The protagonist, Giovanni, has the lowest human score among the entire human race. Every day, he receives “special treatment” for everything including his meals and classes. On top of that, he gets bullied relentlessly by his classmates at the School, both in real life and online.</p><p>But one day, everything and everyone in the school starts attacking Giovanni, trying to “remake” him and raise his human score by making him “more human.” A senior student, the famously eccentric genius Campanella, reaches out to Giovanni, and they hop onto (and take over) a driverless train on the galactic railroad. And so, Giovanni gets swept up in a journey to find the “Crimson Southern Cross,” located at the farthest edge of the universe.</p><p>On their journey, the boys will meet great leaders of the past and pull reckless and destructive “pranks” on them all. Through their encounters with the history, twisted mysteries, and various horrors of the world, they will eventually have to confront the end of their own childhood.</p><p>Oh, did you hear that? The boys are (pointlessly) sounding the train whistle. Looks like it’s time for the galactic express to depart.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giovanni</strong><ul><li>“Shut up! I couldn’t care less about your twisted logic, but here’s the thing, I’m a human! And you’d better start treating me like one!”</li><li>Has a wanted <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal as a father and the lowest human score in the universe. Gets treated like trash by other people and even the system itself. Has a cynical personality and a sharp tongue, but has a soft spot for his family. Always has to earn money to pay his sister’s hospital fees. Although he lives in an age where humans haven’t had to write programs by themselves for generations, Giovanni knows the ancient craftsman technique of writing his own code from scratch. He frequently uses his coding skills to do shady side gigs on the dark web.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Campanella</strong><ul><li>“Come on, show me! Show me the true potential of humanity! Show me something unpredictable, something that could ruin the world as we know it—something a man-made thing could never do!”</li><li>Has the highest human score in the Gymnasium, and very talented in everything from academics to sports, but also has the highest total score deduction in the Gymnasium due to his frequent eccentric behavior. Talk about extreme. Campanella holds “humans” in high regard, and acts arrogantly around the inhuman and artificially intelligent R. However, many claim to have seen him chatting and playing around with R for no reason in particular.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Worldview Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="&quot;Boyhood's End&quot; world view trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJB2_n-9kPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="少年期の終り　世界観PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sa6wqqnJ5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Korean</strong></p><p><iframe title="Boyhood's End 세계관PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72rbzdc4YOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The year is 2036. Humanity has declined. Misha is a Public Safety Operator: a contractor for the Provisional Government tasked with hunting Youkai, and protecting the Quarantine City of Shin-Chiba. Within the haunted ruins of Tokyo, she unearths a mystery that could unmake what remains of civilization.</p><p><em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> is an action-horror shooter about hunting Youkai in the haunted ruins of Tokyo. Combat fuses the tense shooting gameplay of classic survival horror, with the skill-based mechanics and execution of fighting games and spectacle fighters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884769"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clutch System</strong> – Misha’s Modular Gun allows her to rapidly switch between Weapon Modules using command inputs inspired by fighting games. Efficiently dispatching Youkai requires maintaining a cool head and skillful execution, even as the horrifying creatures close in.</li><li><strong>Legends Brought to Life</strong> – The Youkai that Misha encounters are drawn from urban legends, and Japanese folklore. However, they don’t appear exactly as depicted in the well-known stories. These are the monsters the stories are based on.</li><li><strong>Powerful Status Effects</strong> – Weapon Modules are imbued with various elemental damage types that allow Misha to inflict statuses such as “freeze,” “stun,” or “bleed” upon Youkai. Learning when your next shot is going to send a Youkai reeling or freeze them solid is key to <a title="Genres > Survival [276 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</li><li><strong>Build Your Own Combos</strong> – While exploring the ruins of Tokyo, Misha will discover and build up an impressive arsenal of Weapon Modules. Weapon Modules can be slotted into different “Command Slots” in Misha’s Modular Gun, allowing players to choose which command inputs to assign to what modules.</li><li><strong>Lo-Rez Tokyo</strong> – The locations Misha explores in <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> are all based on the real-world districts and neighborhoods of Tokyo. Famous landmarks and beloved streets are realized in a beautiful low-poly aesthetic that is inspired by the early days of 3D video games.</li><li><strong>Kanpai!</strong> – Between missions, Misha and her team have nomikai at a local izakaya in the Quarantine City. These sections will allow players to explore archives from the broken world of <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em>, interact with the inhabitants of the Quarantine City, and drool over low-poly izakaya fare.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PC [20,139 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957360/NIGHTMARE_OPERATOR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>).
