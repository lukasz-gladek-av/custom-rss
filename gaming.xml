              <p><em>Labor Day</em> is here and Amazon is in the mood to clean out its shelves with some deals that feel almost unreal. These record-low prices even beat what we saw during Prime Day in July, which says a lot. And if you’re into LEGO, you probably know Star Wars sets are the ones everyone pays attention to.</p>
<p>Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/">LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi Shuttle has plummeted to an all-time low price of just $47, from a previous price of $80</a> (41% off), with a whopping <strong>4.8 out of 5 stars across more than 1,500 reviews</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Must-Have LEGO Set</h2>
<p>The T-6 Jedi Shuttle (75362) tips the scales at <strong>over 600 pieces</strong> and springs to life as <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s spaceship in the Disney+ series</strong>. LEGO made sure that the shuttle is not a special one that you build and never touch again. Wings are folded up to flight position, there is an opening cockpit, and the set makes space for play scenarios that Star Wars fans will recognize straight away.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for collectors is the lineup of mini-figures included in the kit: <strong>Ahsoka Tano herself is featured with her dual white lightsabers</strong>, but with her as well is Sabine Wren with blasters, Professor Huyang with his unique droid model, and Marrok, one of the show’s antagonists, with a double-bladed lightsaber. Minifig fans alone are already made this set worth a purchase because exclusive figures inflate aftermarket values.</p>



<p>Design-wise, the T-6 has the details you’d hope for in a modern LEGO Star Wars release: The <strong>ship measures over 10 inches long, about 9 inches wide, and stands 3 inches tall in its landed form</strong>. That makes it a satisfying build that looks good on display without taking over your entire shelf. The play features (like stud shooters and the adjustable wings) are intuitive enough for younger builders to use frequently without frustration.</p>
<p>It’s also a great gift option. With Disney+ placing Ahsoka at the center of Star Wars storytelling momentum, there’s a safe bet kids (and a decent number of adults) will have this ship on their holiday list. At under fifty dollars, it’s one of those deals you don’t hesitate at.</p>

            <p>Bioshock creator Ken Levine has stepped out from the shadows to remind the world about his next project Judas, the first-person action adventure game from Ghost Story Games, through a new dev blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">This post</a> revealed a new feature called Villainy - a player-choice driven system that modifies who'll become an antagonist throughout the game. Basically, you start off with "the big three" being on good terms, but if you ignore one of them for too long they get cross and try to kill you.</p>
<p>The post continues with Levine laying praise on Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system, and how it allowed the player to develop relationships with various orcs. This it seems is a substantial source of inspiration for the Villainy system in Judas, with one of the Big Three turning nasty feeling like "losing a friend".</p>

<p>There's still no release date for Judas. <a href="http://eurogamer.net/games/judas">First revealed back in 2022</a>, it's been largely silent on the Judas front ever since. Though, with an indication that more dev blogs are on the way, maybe we're steering a little closer to a world with Judas in it. That'll at the very least mark one of those mystery gameshow titles off the "what ever happened to…" list.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dino-crisis-remake-was-attempted-twice-in-the-past-few-years-but-projects-were-scrapped-due-to-quality-%E2%80%93-rumor.1282731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dino Crisis remake was reportedly attempted twice, but the projects were later scrapped due to low quality.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on X, known CAPCOM leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a> revealed that, in the past few years, CAPCOM attempted to bring back the survival horror series with a remake of the first game. The first attempt was from CAPCOM Vancouver before they were shut down, while the second one was from an unspecified CAPCOM team a few years ago. This project, however, wasn't turning out good and was eventually scrapped.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) I hope Capcom eventually figures out what they want to do with Dino Crisis. For the record, &amp; I don't believe this is new info, but there has been a couple attempts in the last decade to remake Dino Crisis, the first by Capcom Vancouver before they were shut down (still <a href="https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX">https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763101613318388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although previous attempts at developing a Dino Crisis remake have reportedly failed, there's a good chance the classic survival horror series may be close to a comeback. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-has-been-trademarked-in-japan-by-capcom-reigniting-hopes-for-a-comeback/">Earlier this year</a>, the series was trademarked again in Japan, something that is usually done in the country when there's a real intention of using an IP again, and in Brazil a few months ago. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-dino-crisis-trademark-revival/">Brazilian filing</a> is particularly interesting, as the series was trademarked again at the same time CAPCOM filed a trademark for Resident Evil Requiem, and with a similar trademark class, entertainment and video games. Hopefully, these trademarks really mean something is in the works for a series that is long overdue its return.</p>



<p>The Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, but the classic franchise made a small comeback earlier this year with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">GOG release</a> of the first two entries in the series, complete with new features and improvements such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support, and much more.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a> developers Crystal Dynamics have laid off an unspecified number of staff, their <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">second round of jobs cuts</a> this year. The studio say that the future of the Tomb Raider series won't be affected by this latest taking away of folks' livelihoods.</p>
<p>The news comes not too long after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot Crystal Dynamics were working alongside The Initiative was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">cancelled amid Microsoft's mass cuts in July</a>. The Initiative were shut down as part of that culling.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Crystal Dynamics announced these layoffs via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-we-made-the-very-difficult-decision-activity-7366524687985594369-VkBI">LinkedIn post</a>, which neglected to mention exactly how many staff had been let go.</p>
<p>"Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," they wrote. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition."</p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics added that the future of Tomb Raider is "unaffected" by these job cuts. There's currently a new Tomb Raider in the works, and it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">set to be published by Amazon</a>.</p>

"After nearly 8 long years I've been laid off from Crystal Dynamics. It's been a helluva run. From Avengers to Tomb Raider to Perfect Dark it has been a journey of a ton of growth.

<p>Best of luck to all affected.</p>

            <p>What a strange reality we live in, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-loves-combat-so-much-it-feels-like-its-fighting-itself">Silent Hill is becoming worryingly actionised</a> and Resident "No thanks bro" Evil is perceived as being too scary. Horror developers: that is the <em>wrong way around</em>. Regardless, the latter point has been raised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> director Koshi Nakanishi himself, who told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/resident-evil/resident-evil-7-was-possibly-too-scary-and-some-people-couldnt-handle-it-says-director-koshi-nakanishi-and-thats-why-resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-mode-to-make-it-slightly-easier-to-deal-with/">GamesRadar+</a> that part of the reasoning for giving the upcoming sequel a choice of first and third person modes was that the solely FPP <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7</a> – which Nakanishi also directed – maybe worked a little too well at enabling scares.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Looking back at Resident Evil 7's first person perspective, I implemented that as a way to make it more immersive and more scary than ever before," he said. "Which I think most, you know, media and players agreed it was an incredibly scary game, but it was possibly too scary."</p> <figure>

<p>Requiem doesn’t strictly intend to induce fewer gasps and squeaks – it’s previously been pitched as offering "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-core-concept-behind-resident-evil-requiem-is-addictive-fear-which-isnt-entirely-as-silly-as-it-sounds">addictive fear</a>" – but its third-person option will at least attempt to ease up on the intensity, for those who don’t want the beasties getting quite so up in their faces.</p>
<p>"I think some people couldn't handle it, and either couldn't finish or didn't even start [Resi 7]," Nakanishi continues. "And that's something that I look back on thinking that, you know, I want to make sure that people can enjoy this game. So if you started the game off in first person perspective, and you're finding it's too much, then third person is almost a way to step slightly back from that level of horror and make it slightly easier to deal with by having the character on screen as a kind of avatar of yourself."</p><p>I doubt this has been a recent revelation in Capcom’s minds, as the intervening <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> returned to third person for its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-now-try-a-demo-of-resident-evil-villages-new-third-person-mode">Shadow of Rose expansion</a>, including the added option to – hey, this sounds familiar – play the entire main game in either FPP or TPP. And I’d say Requiem having this choice from the start would let Nakanishi direct its scripted scares with the possibility of multiple perspectives in mind, but then what we’ve seen of the new game suggests it takes the same approach to cutscenes as Village’s third person mode: simply cutting back to first-person until you regain control.</p>
<p>As such, swinging out to an over-the-shoulder camera still won’t spare you from <em>every</em> in-yer-face jump scare, or lingering closeup of a monster’s gob. I’d also add that, having played the same Requiem demo that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">Edwin did back in June</a>, I’d agree with him that it generally seems crafted with a preference for seeing straight through the eyes of new protagonist Grace Ashcroft. Hearing through her ears, too. I, uh, completely forgot to try third person mode at the time, but it’s hard to imagine Grace’s panicked breaths and the dreadful heaviness of nearby footsteps having the same nerve-rustling impact with several feet of extra in-game distance. Still, apparently that’s the point.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-handheld-specs-leaked-will-easily-outperform-xbox-rog-ally-x-base-playstation-5-with-patched-games.1282713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 handheld specifications have leaked online, suggesting the yet-to-be-announced handheld should comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X and even the base PlayStation 5 in certain scenarios.</p>



<p>In a new video shared earlier today on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, who has recently proved to be quite reliable regarding PlayStation leaks, revealed some new information on the portable system, which has been obtained via up-to-date documentation. The handheld will be powered by the Canis APU, a monolithic 135mm square die manufactured on a TSMC 3nm node featuring 4 Zen 6c CPU cores and 2 Zen 6 Low Power cores that will run the operating system and all non-gaming tasks with 4MB of L3 for the Zen 6c CCX, a 16 CUs RDNA5 GPU clocked at around 1.20 GHz in handheld mode and around 1.65GHz in docked mode and a 192-bit LPDDR5X-8533 memory controller with support to up to 48GB of RAM. Rounding up the features of the handheld are backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, a MicroSD slot, M.2 slot, haptic feedback support, dual mics and a touchscreen.</p>



<p>There is no solid information regarding how much RAM the PlayStation 6 handheld will feature, but it is expected to feature more than 16 or even 24 GB. Asked to comment on the matter, some unspecified developers unanimously agreed that the amounts above wouldn't be enough to run next-generation games with AI features, as even features like UE5's Nanite require a lot of RAM to work properly. As such, these developers believe that anything between 24 and 36 GB of RAM is required for next-gen games.</p>



<p>With these leaked specs seemingly revealed, MLiD also made some performance estimation for the unrevealed PlayStation 6 handheld. Rasterization performance is expected to be between 0.55 and 0.75 times that of the PlayStation 5 in docked mode, while ray tracing performance is between 1.3 and 2.6, which would bring the handheld close to the ray tracing performance of the PlayStation 5 Pro at peak. Factoring in AMD FSR 4 support, the handheld should be able to run patched games at around the PlayStation 5 level of performance, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver mode</a> level with unpatched games. With the faster RDNA5 CUs, which are between 40% and 50% faster than RDNA 3.5 CUs and 60% more bandwidth, the system should also comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>With the specs on hand, MLiD also made some estimations on how much the PlayStation 6 handheld should cost to produce and its final price, which is estimated to be between $399-499, based on the better yields of the TSMC 3nm node, the cost of RAM, compared to previous generation, and the fact that Sony seems to always launch hardware at a loss, although if the estimated costs are correct, Sony would be able to take a small profit even at $399.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be one of the most popular games around, and ranked mode can throw up plenty of engagement in chat. If you’ve seen a C9 message and don’t know what it means, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>The Netease title continues to go from strength to strength, with Marvel Rivals developers regularly interacting with the community to explain controversial topics, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking system</a>, and to provide content updates.</p>



<p>With fast-paced action, players will often use abbreviations and slang to communicate in chat, and the C9 term is a common sight. To help you understand, we’ve got a full explanation.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals">What Does C9 Mean in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>C9 in Marvel Rivals is a short, taunting message used when a team neglects to capture a control point or objective, when it’s readily available to capture with ease, and loses a round or match as a result.</strong></p>



<p>The term refers to Esports team <a href="https://cloud9.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cloud9</a>, with the meme stretching back to an Overwatch tournament in 2017, where the team lost several rounds due to abandoning the objective on multiple occasions in a single match against the Afreeca Freecs Blue.</p>



<p>Given that Marvel Rivals and Overwatch share a lot of similarities, it’s not too surprising to see the term make its way into Marvel Rivals, particularly in Ranked mode.</p>



<p>Messages containing C9 will most likely be shared by opponents at the end of a round or the match, mocking mistakes made by your team. Common situations where this can occur are neglecting to capture an objective when it’s there for the taking, particularly if pushing for kills on enemy players outside the zone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-respond-to-c9-messages-in-marvel-rivals">How to Respond to C9 Messages in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p><strong>Don’t respond with trash talk to any C9 messages sent in Marvel Rivals, as it could lead to temporary or permanent bans from the game. Instead, ignore them.</strong></p>



<p>The C9 term can help you improve, however, as it’s a sure indicator that your team made a big mistake in the match. If you’ve seen this message in chat, go back and watch the replay to see where the mistake happened and what you could do better to improve.</p>



<p>Using replays in this way is a great way to improve your performance in Marvel Rivals, particularly in ranked matches, and was one of the biggest tips that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-aramori-confident-more-women-will-make-marvel-rivals-esports-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sentinels pro Aramori gave Insider Gaming in an exclusive interview</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is making a splash across multiple platforms, including a platform debut on PlayStation, but split-screen co-op availability has caused some confusion.</p>



<p>Released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded has been brought into the modern generation with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features like crossplay</a>, which is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-gears-of-war-reloaded-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest differences compared to Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>.</p>



<p>While split-screen co-op was commonplace when Gears of War initially launched, the gaming world has changed a lot in the past few decades, so we’ve got all the details on whether the feature is available in the latest version.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-ps5">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Gears of War: Reloaded offers local co-op via split screen on PlayStation 5 as one of its campaign features.</strong></p>



<p>Split-screen multiplayer in Reloaded on PlayStation 5 supports a maximum of two players, with the main account controlling Marcus Fenix and the secondary controlling Dom Santiago. In fact, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-gears-of-war-reloaded-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies to earn</a> from completing the game via co-op, which can also be done online.</p>



<p>Split-screen co-op on PlayStation 5 is launched via the Campaign menu.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-xbox">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, just like the original title and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Gears of War: Reloaded on Xbox Series X|S supports local co-op through split screen.</strong></p>



<p>The feature was a core mechanic in the original title over 20 years ago, and while split-screen co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, it remains available in Reloaded. This isn’t too surprising though, as there was no reason for the feature to be removed.</p>



<p>Just like on PlayStation, one player controls Marcus and the other controls Dom. Split-screen co-op is launched in the Campaign Menu.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-pc-amp-steam">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on PC &amp; Steam?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Gears of War: Reloaded does not offer local co-op and split-screen on PC, which has been a cause of contention.</strong></p>



<p>Initial listings for Reloaded on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> listed split-screen co-op as an available feature, though that mention has since been removed. As a result, the Steam version of the game has received a surge of negative reviews, with other issues, including crashes, also being reported.</p>



<p>The Xbox store listing for Gears of War: Reloaded states that local co-op is not available on PC, though it’s unclear whether this has been added recently or has always been there.</p>

            <p>Bethesda has teased an upcoming update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> meant to improve space travel, following a recent bit of data mining from the community that discovered hints of an overhauled "cruise mode".</p>
<p>Now, a hasty patch was uploaded to remove hints of the cruise mode from the files, but since then Bethesda have come forward with its hands up and admitted that yes, cruise mode is real and is on the way somewhat soon.</p>
<p>This came out via a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zknfAghd-s">developer spotlight on Tim Lamb</a>, a senior producer at Bethesda. In this video Lamb states: "We have some exciting things in development, including free updates and player-requested features, as well as a new DLC story."</p>

We're also adding new game systems and some smaller surprises.

With the game's absence from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> this year this has led to some confusion, but it looks like something big is on the horizon for Bethesda's Sci-Fi RPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation fans finally rejoiced in 2025 with the arrival of Gears of War: Reloaded. It marked the first time Gears has ever been officially playable on a PlayStation console. A glance at Reloaded’s Platinum Trophy suggests we might not be done yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is still one of the most shocking games to me in recent memory. The idea of a core Xbox exclusive that helped Microsoft dominate the console wars in the early 00s to 2010s being on PS5 is unreal. That’s where we are, though. Reloaded is a complete remake of the first Gears title, and PlayStation owners can experience it for themselves.</p>



<p>The Reloaded trophy list features many of the original’s challenges, but the description of the Platinum Trophy is eye-catching.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-gears-of-war-games-potentially-coming-to-playstation-5">More Gears of War Games Potentially Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’d like more. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-gears-of-war-reloaded-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded’s trophy list</a> has a Platinum Trophy called “Nothin’ Left.” As usual, you earn it for getting every other trophy in the game. This is a tough feat when you consider you need to beat every campaign mission on Insane Difficulty.</p>



<p>The Platinum Trophy description is very interesting: “Your adventure is over, <strong>for now</strong>…”</p>



<p>The final two words are very telling. The Platinum Trophy is exclusive to PlayStation users, and Xbox users don’t have an extra Achievement for getting all the others. It feels like a message tailored specifically to PS fans. There are already rumors that <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is only the beginning of the ports and remakes.</p>



<p>Initial leaks suggested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-games-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-include/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded was going to be all three</a> of the OG Gears games. Reports indicate that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-gears-e-day-on-ps5-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears E-Day is on its way to PS5</a>. I think whatever happens, there’s a good chance we’ve not seen the last of new Gears content on PlayStation.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/dead-take-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-take-review.1282686/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Dead Take doesn’t announce itself with cheap shocks. Instead, it creeps in like a bad memory, pulling you through the corridors of an opulent mansion where every locked door feels like it’s hiding something rotten. It’s less about what jumps out at you, and more about what lingers when the screen goes black.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEAD TAKE | OUT NOW | OFFICIAL LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nx-Adkki9yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From its opening frames, Dead Take signals a different kind of horror. This is less a sprint through monsters and more a slow walk into moral quicksand. It’s a first-person, FMV-driven psychological thriller about ambition, manipulation, and the way an industry can turn people into raw material. You play Chase Lowry (Neil Newbon), an actor following the trail of his missing friend, Vinny Monroe (Ben Starr), inside the silent mansion of a powerful Hollywood producer. There’s no combat here and precious little hand-holding, just a maze of puzzles, screens, and an awful lot of things you can’t unknow once you’ve seen them.</p>


<p>The single-location setup does the heavy lifting. The house is lavish, sterile, and empty; your only contact with its owner, Duke Cain, comes as disembodied messages and the artifacts he’s left behind. The silence is suffocating, not because anything is chasing you, but because every drawer or projector you touch might peel back another layer of somebody’s performance—on screen and off it. The emptiness matters: you’re never measuring people in the room, only the versions of themselves they’ve recorded for others to see. That distance is the point, and it’s where the game’s nastiest questions live. Cain’s voice, while uncredited in-game but widely identified as creative director Abubakar Salim, adds a smug, omnipresent chill as he needles you from afar.</p>


<p>FMV can be a gimmick, but here it’s the backbone. Newbon’s Chase anchors the story with a weary, probing presence; most of his “acting” is in how you, as Chase, watch others. Starr’s Vinny is the live wire: charming on the surface, then fraying in front of the lens as opportunities curdle into coercion. Watching him unravel, in screen tests, interviews, and clipped “notes”, is more disturbing than any loud sting.</p>
<p>The supporting roster sells the conceit that this is a Hollywood ecosystem chewing people up. Jane Perry turns up as Lia Cane, icily professional and impossible to read, while Alanah Pearce’s Victoria Case is a cooler, more vulnerable counterpoint. There are also cameos from well known figure heads in the gaming industry, such as Laura Bailey, Sam Lake, and Matthew Mercer, each slotted in as faces you “know” from elsewhere, which the game smartly uses to poke at your own parasocial expectations. That extra-textual recognition isn’t a distraction; it’s the horror. Fame is a mask, and Dead Take keeps asking why we’re so eager to trust it.</p>
<p>Crucially, you’re not reading micro-tells across a dinner table; you’re parsing them through an edit suite. The most chilling moments are small—breaths held too long, a line delivered just a bit too clean, an apology that lands like a threat. You are constantly wondering if you can trust anything you see on the screen.</p>

<p>Moment to moment, this is an exploratory puzzle game. You sweep rooms for scrawled numbers, rummage through props and contracts, and, most importantly, collect USB sticks to feed the theatre’s workstation. There an AI-assisted editor lets you splice together found footage – auditions, interviews, B-roll – into “new” cuts that surface codes, unlock doors, and nudge the story forward. It’s elegantly literal: the same manipulations that shape careers and headlines are the tools you wield to progress.</p>
<p>I just wish this feature was utilised to greater effect. You are very limited to what you can actually splice, with the only correct combinations pushing the narrative forward. It would have been great if you could splice other pieces of footage together to get bonus insight into the goings on of Dead Take. Discovering the correct splices usually follows with a knocking on the theater door, which is initially scary, until the fifth time it happens where something magically appears to progress the story. It’s never explicitly explained whether something super natural is going on or if Chase has lost it. Maybe that’s the point though.</p>
<p>And yes, there are jump scares; loud, sometimes very loud. They get you early and occasionally overstay their welcome later, becoming very predictable and way less scary. The scare design is effective in the moment; the audio balance, less so.</p>

<p>Underneath the genre trappings, Dead Take is a character study about what people will trade for a shot at being seen. Vinny wants the role. Chase wants the truth. The house wants them both. The way you assemble clips to get what you need is the subtext made mechanical: stories are built, not found, and the builder always leaves fingerprints. When the game lets you sit with that, when you realize a cruel outburst or a teary confession is both “real” and carefully staged, it becomes properly unsettling.</p>
<p>The industry satire isn’t subtle. It doesn’t have to be. Power flows through gatekeepers; “notes” are weapons; NDAs feel like spells. There’s a particularly sharp sequence where a creative pitch is reduced to a brand deck, and the footage you’re splicing is less a “scene” than a negotiation over who’s allowed to exist inside it. The critique lands because the performances do. The FMV isn’t a novelty, it’s the only way to make these cuts hurt.</p>
<p>Credit to the art and sound teams for making a still, empty mansion feel predatory. The lighting carves the house into little stages – the piano room, projection suite, gallery – while long corridors amplify your doubt. The score is sparing, letting the granular foley work of keys, paper, a projector stuttering to life do the creeping. There’s restraint here. The game wants you leaning forward to hear, not flinching at every corner.</p>
<p>It’s also keenly paced for a shorter experience. I finished it in around three hours, but you can expect about four to five hours on a first run, depending on how often you get lost in the edit bay. That length feels right for the structure: long enough to build a rhythm of explore-watch-splice, short enough that the central metaphor doesn’t wear thin. If anything drags, it’s those occasional lock-and-key detours or an over-eager sting. The loop settles into a satisfying pattern: sweep a wing of the house, find a clue, sit down with the footage, and make a truth you can use.</p>

<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, Hollow Knight: Silksong impressed us during our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and excitement levels are through the roof with players eagerly waiting for their chance to get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>Modern gaming is now a mostly digital world, with physical releases becoming increasingly rarer, and we’ve got all the details on whether Silksong will have a physical edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hollow-knight-silksong-have-a-physical-release">Will Hollow Knight: Silksong Have a Physical Release?</h2>

<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be releasing a Physical Edition, but it won’t be available at launch on September 4. Instead, it will be released in 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Physical copies will first be available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles in early 2026, before physical versions of the game on other platforms follow later in the year.</p>



<p>Specifics on why a physical release will come months after a digital release have not been stated, though it’s likely to be due to the small team that <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> has. This has resulted in other changes too, including making up part of the decision <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to send out review copies</a> to media and content creators.</p>



<p>Pre-order details for a Physical Edition are also not available, though we should see more news in the weeks and months after the release takes place, with the focus understandably on preparing for release.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-collector-s-edition">Will There be a Hollow Knight: Silksong Collector’s Edition?</h2>



<p><strong>It has not been confirmed whether Hollow Knight: Silksong will receive a Collector’s Edition, though it could be on the cards in future.</strong></p>



<p>The original Hollow Knight game received a Collector’s Edition, which featured a physical copy of the game, including all DLC, a 14-page comic book, a box case, a metal brooch, and a gold foil art print set. Inside the physical copy, there was also a manual and a fold-out map of Hallownest.</p>



<p>Players didn’t have to wait too long for the Collector’s Edition either, with Hollow Knight initially launching in February 2019, with the Collector’s Edition following in May. However, with the Physical Editions of Silksong not coming until 2026, the wait for a Collector’s Edition this time around will likely be longer.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima parted ways with Konami in 2015 after spending decades as one of the top creative minds in the company. Since that time, Kojima has launched his own company and released two Death Stranding games. Okamura has openly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-producer-would-love-to-work-with-hideo-kojima-on-metal-gear-solid/1100-6524582/" data-ref-id="1100-6524582">shared his admiration for Kojima</a> and expressed his desire to work with him again on MGS. However, Kojima has his own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">MGS-like game</a> called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>, which may still be a few years away. The director recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/" data-ref-id="1100-6533807">Physint is still in a conceptual phase</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is out today on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Although it won't be ready at launch, Konami is adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/" data-ref-id="1100-6532384">a new online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt</a> this fall. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-deltas-new-online-multiplayer-mode-wont-support-cross-play/1100-6533922/">it won't support cross-play</a>. The new version of the game was very positively received in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">GameSpot's review of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p>

                <p>While players are still enjoying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">Peak's brand-new Mesa biome</a>, the game's latest patch is here to address some technical concerns--specifically making it easier to run <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> on lower-powered computers.</p><p>The latest patch, which brings the game to version 1.27.a, introduces a new Texture Quality graphics setting. The new option, which Team Peak says has been much-requested, allows players with low VRAM to lower the texture quality, reducing the incidence of low framerates, missing graphics, and potential crashes. The developer notes that the lower texture quality "doesn’t even look much worse," so it's worth checking out for anyone who's been experiencing performance issues in Peak.</p><p>The developer has also added support for DX11 graphics API, alongside existing options DX12 and Vulkan. "It might be better, it might be worse," the patch notes warn, but suggest players who have had issues with the other options give it a try anyway. "We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!"</p><p>The performance-focused update has also made Peak's existing Render Scale options "more dramatic," meaning players who choose Medium or Low options should see a more obvious difference in performance.</p><p>In addition to these changes, Team Peak has added a new accessibility setting in the form of Photosensitive Mode, which dials down a number of visual effects that may impact people with photosensitivity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new performance options make up the bulk of this update, though a few other things have been mopped up with the small patch. In absence of a true map randomizer, the dev says Mesa and Peak will now simply alternate every other day--and because Mesa will appear less often, the secret entrance in the map will now appear 50% of the time instead of 25%.</p><p>The Peak dev has also reintroduced a known issue to the game with The Kiln's lava--the patch notes say they failed to reproduce the issue in-house, so are re-enabling the rising lava in hopes of getting more reports about the bug and when it occurs.</p><p>Check out the full list of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498330460301034111" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>PEAK PATCH 1.27.a:</h2><h3>OPTIONS</h3><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS SETTING: Texture Quality  <ul><li>This is actually huge. You can now lower the texture quality across the game, which is important for players with low VRAM. This can resolve issues with low framerate, missing graphics, and even crashes. Also it doesn’t even look much worse. Check it out!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS API: DX11  <ul><li>The game can now be launched in DX11 in addition to our DX12 and Vulkan options. For players who have had trouble with our previous two options, give this a try. It might be better, it might be worse. We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!</li></ul></li><li>Render Scale options are now more dramatic, you should see higher performance gains if you play on Medium or Low.</li><li>NEW ACCESSIBILITY SETTING: Photosensitive Mode.  <ul><li>This mode changes the following:  <ul><li>Dynamite, Flare, and Scout Cannon lit fuse effects are less flashy</li><li>Screenshake is lessened.</li><li>Bright lights from the dynamite explosion are disabled.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from taking various sources of damage are less intense and more gradual.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from the Energy Drink, Lollipop, and Heat Pack are less intense.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>You can now change your sash in the Passport to any you’ve unlocked via ascents!</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><ul><li>The ALPINE and the MESA will now alternate every other day.</li><li>A secret entrance in the MESA is now open 50% of the time instead of 25%.

                <p>After a couple of weeks of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-beta-update-brings-rival-cartel-to-drug-selling-game/1100-6533908/" data-ref-id="1100-6533908">testing on the beta branch</a>, the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1 </a>update, Rival Cartels, is now live in the main game. The update introduces competition in the form of Hyland Point's Benzies family, as well as a new property to purchase, a new vehicle, and more.</p><p>Viral hit Schedule 1 sees players build a drug-dealing empire from the ground up, and the new update adds some new obstacles for the player's rise to power--as well as new possibilities. The Benzies family will only be introduced once the player has unlocked a few customers in Westville, and once you're on their radar, they'll interfere with your business through ambushes, theft, robbing your dealers, and stealing your customers. You'll also be able to truce with the Benzies, unlocking new cartel-player deals.</p><p>Once you've completed the rival cartel's full storyline, you'll be able to purchase the new Hyland Manor property. The update also comes with a few new features, including a graffiti system that can be used to reduce the cartel's influence and gain XP. Cartel influence is something you'll have to be aware of as you progress through Schedule 1--different areas on the map will now be locked if cartel influence is too high, and players will have to reduce the influence in order to unlock new regions.</p><p>As well as the new property and mechanics, the update also adds a handful of new items and cosmetics, including the Hotbox vehicle, a pump shotgun, and some new hairstyles for you to customize the player character.</p><p>Despite its runaway success, Schedule 1 is the work of a single developer operating as Tyler's Video Game Studio, or TVGS. Tyler has apologized for recent updates taking longer than initially scheduled, and in the most recent Steam update said that he will no longer be specifying release dates for updates. The solo dev has also said that he hopes to get some office space and bring a couple of full-time developers on board for Schedule 1 soon.</p><p>Check out the rest of the patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393722" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Schedule 1's latest update</a> below:</p><h2>Schedule 1 v0.4.0</h2><h3>Additions</h3><ul><li>Added the Benzies family - a powerful rival cartel in Hyland Point.

                <p>Next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will introduce players to Grace Ashcroft, the newest protagonist in the franchise. In the trailers shared so far, Grace has been way over her head in danger. That's how she enters the story, but she won't remain that way forever. According to director Kōshi Nakanishi, Grace's transformation from helpless to powerful may represent the "most extreme gap" in the franchise.</p><p>"We're at the testing phase now in development as we gear up to the February release, and even as we play it internally, putting ourselves in the mindset of the players--I really feel that it's going to be an incredible rollercoaster," Nakanishi told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "They're going to feel like that curve of tension to release is going to be ... it's perhaps the most extreme gap between those two axes. The points on that curve are going to be so far apart from each other that it's going to be incredible."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil 9 Requiem - Official Gamescom Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To illustrate his point without giving away spoilers, Nakanishi referred to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-explores-the-backstory-of-new-heroine-grace-ashcroft/1100-6534107/" data-ref-id="1100-6534107">the unhinged creature that hunts Grace in the trailer</a>. It's the latest stalker character in the RE franchise, but Grace will have a way to deal with it even if she can't kill it.</p><p>"We're pretty tight-lipped on the details at this stage, but we want to give players a method to overcome the stalker enemy," noted Nakanishi. "What that entails is something that we'll be getting into down the line, but I think that you'll feel like you finally have a chance to turn the tables and deal with the stalker in a way that you haven't been able to in past titles."</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27, 2026. It's part of Capcom's plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-gears-up-for-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-celebration-with-new-website/1100-6534067/" data-ref-id="1100-6534067">the 30th anniversary of Resident Evil</a>, most of which remain under wraps for now. Weapons director Zach Cregger is also helming the new Resident Evil movie, which is set to debut in theaters on September 18, 2026.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">post shared on LinkedIn</a>, the studio thanked those impacted by these layoffs for their "hard work, talent and passion", stating Crystal Dynamics is "committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition".</p>

            <p>
Konami has acknowledged issues with Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater, as the stealth game remake launches today.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of release, some reviews have noted disappointing performance, particularly with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> version of the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am0ER7iW2lo">Digital Foundry</a>, for instance, noted issues due to the console's PSSR upscaling, despite it overall being a beautiful game.
</p>
<p>
In a statement shared on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022">social media</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">Steam</a>, Konami said it had "received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them", though general performance is not mentioned beyond a couple of specific points causing crashes.

<p>
The known issues acknowledged by Konami are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>
<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater is available now across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">Eurogamer's five star review of Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</a> describes it as "a surprisingly sensitive remake from Konami" that brings a legend back to life.

            <title><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast Hires Former Monolith Developers to Work on New Project]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-hires-former-monolith-developers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-hires-former-monolith-developers-to-work-on-new-project.1282635/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There is little doubt that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Monolith Productions</a> by Warner Bros. was one of the worst news of the year in the gaming industry, so it's great to learn that Wizards of the Coast has hired a small team of former developers led by Michael de Plater.</p>



<p>Truth be told, de Plater and his colleagues had been working more recently at Cliffhanger Games on the Black Panther game that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a few months ago by Electronic Arts</a>. Prior to that, though, they had been at Monolith Productions for a long time. de Plater himself worked on both 2014's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and the sequel, 2017's Middle-earth: Shadow of War. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Wizards of the Coast president John Hight said:</p>



<p><em>We're super excited to have him as part of the team. We were actually able to bring him and 14 key people that he's worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us. He'll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can't tell you yet. We want to give him time. We'll go through a fairly lengthy concept process where they're going to look at a lot of different ideas.</em></p>



<p>It sounds like it will take quite a lot of time before the public gets any info on the new project, but at least we know it's coming. Hight also said it's going to be a fairly similar process to that seen with Stig Asmussen's Giant Skull, although that team hit the ground running and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already making a D&amp;D  action/adventure game</a>.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast has <span>been investing heavily in video games lately. About a year ago, then-president Chris Cocks (now CEO at parent company Hasbro)&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-goes-all-in-on-videogames-wants-to-ship-1-2-games-per-year-starting-late-2025-early-2026/" target="_blank">revealed</a>&nbsp;a plan to ship one or two video games each year, starting in&nbsp;</span>late 2025 or early 2026.</p>



<p>Its announced projects, be them internal or external, include <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/">a new D&amp;D game from Invoke Studios</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op D&amp;D game from Starbreeze</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>, the digital tabletop adventure <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEMEO x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: BATTLEMARKED</a>, the aforementioned D&amp;D action/adventure game by Giant Skull, the sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a> in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe game in the making at Atomic Arcade. Another project made at Skeleton Key was reportedly canceled earlier this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected.</p>



<p>Here's the whole message that was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.</em></p>



<p><em>To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.</em> <em>To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision.</em></p>



<p>The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP.</p>



<p>In April 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">vague goals to create an interconnected universe</a> that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air on Prime Video</a>.</p>



<p>As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-shown-in-the-not-too-distant-future-says-amazon-games-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-mentions-next-starfield-dlc-for-the-third-time-but-still-can%E2%80%99t-confirm-details.1282614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans have all but given up waiting for the next Starfield expansion, which is <strong>long </strong>overdue for an announcement. In July, I conducted a deep dive into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-missing-expansion-bethesda-silence-unease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Starfield DLC</a>, which has been teased by Bethesda Game Studios for more than a year but has no firm indication of what it is or when it will be released.</p>



<p>It’s in danger of shattering Todd Howard’s promise of ‘one major expansion a year for Starfield’, the 2023 space RPG that set the world ablaze for all of about two weeks.</p>



<p>In a recent developer showcase, yet another reference to the Starfield expansion was dropped, <strong>but yet again</strong>, it was mentioned that no details can be shared.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-starfield-s-next-expansion">Where is Starfield’s Next Expansion?</h2>



<p>Shattered Space, the first Starfield expansion that ultimately failed to move mountains, was detailed <strong>before Starfield even came out in September 2023.</strong> We knew what it looked like months before it launched in September 2024.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, almost an entire year later, and <strong>we haven’t got a clue what the next expansion will be</strong>.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has had umpteen chances to reveal the next Starfield expansion, but has neglected to do so, which suggests issues with the DLC’s development.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?t=303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent developer spotlight</a> with Tim Lamb, who has been with Bethesda since 2006, broke down his career. In the closing seconds of the interview, Lamb addressed the future of Starfield:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As it comes to Starfield, I’m really excited for players to see what the team has been working on.</p>



<p>We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p>



<p><strong>I can’t go into all the details just yet</strong>, but I will say that part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June 2024, Todd Howard confirmed another expansion was in development, and in March 2025, the Bethesda team said that ‘exciting things’ are planned for this year that they can’t talk about. We’re now approaching September 2025, and <strong>we still have absolutely nothing to go on</strong> where Starfield is concerned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76’s Premium Subscription is Giving Members Another Massive Advantage]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76%E2%80%99s-premium-subscription-is-giving-members-another-massive-advantage.1282599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76’s ‘premium subscription’, Fallout 1st, is set to give players another huge advantage over ‘non-paying’ users of the post-apocalyptic MMO platform. In recent years, many key perks of the plan have popped up, with Bethesda Game Studios stumping up plenty of reasons why Fallout fans should part ways with some monthly cash to secure Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the latest change to Fallout 1st, a ‘Doctor Bag Aid Box’ has popped up on the PTS (Public Test Server) in Fallout 76. This feature will enable Fallout 1st subscribers to store an unlimited number of chems in their C.A.M.P.</p>



<h2 id="h-unlimited-chem-storage-in-fallout-76-courtesy-of-fallout-1st">Unlimited Chem Storage in Fallout 76, Courtesy of Fallout 1st</h2>



<p>When I was a non-stop fan of Fallout 76, I’d endlessly preach the benefits of Fallout 1st. For a few dollars a month, you can secure a stack of Atoms, boosters, custom server access, exclusive outfits and items, survival tents, and <strong>much more</strong>. It seems silly to have a Fallout 76 account that’s <strong>not </strong>paired with Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>The latest addition might be enough to sway more players over to the realms of Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the PTS, players have noticed the arrival of the Doctor Bag Aid Box, an item that has been talked about for a few weeks. In Fallout 76, the Doctor Bag Aid Box is a deployable item in your C.A.M.P. that allows you to store an unlimited number of chems, such as Stimpaks.</p>



<p>Given how Stimpaks, Super Stimpaks, Psycho, Jet, Buffout, and other chems have a fair weight requirement in Fallout 76, this is a boon for players building their character/s around using them. No longer will they take up precious stash allowances, and soon, they’ll have a dedicated space in your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p>This mimics the addition of the ammo storage unit that was thrown into Fallout 76 several months ago, and it, of course, aligns with the scrap box that Fallout 1st subscribers have been using for years.</p>



<p>Would unlimited chem storage in Fallout 76 sway you into purchasing Fallout 1st? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
