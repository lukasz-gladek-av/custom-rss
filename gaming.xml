            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’m a big fan of both The Last of Us games. The first game is easily one of my favourite games ever, and the second game is up there somewhere too. Combat is a real highlight for me, specifically its scrappy, improvisational nature alongside all the attention to detail that Naughty Dog lavished these games with to make each situation incredibly intense, but if I’m honest a huge part of why I love these games is the story. My only real issue with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2</a> is that the narrative pacing constantly drags me out of all the artfully built up tension with flashbacks and diversions. With the recently released Chronological Mode, I was very interested to see if that could improve, to my mind, the flow of the storytelling.</p>
<p><em><strong>BEWARE:</strong> As we’re going to discuss the story of The Last of Us Part 2, there will be spoilers for both The Last of Us games… and the TV show. Shocking, we know.</em></p>



<p>So what is chronological mode? Well, it does exactly what it says on the tin: you play through the entire game but, instead of flashing forwards and back wildly, it’s all in strictly chronological order. That means that the experience of playing the game, particularly towards the beginning, is drastically different. You actually start here playing with Abby in a brief fifteen minute intro to the character where you’re also introduced to her zebra-saving father… only to see how he’s so cruelly wrenched away from her and Joel’s role in this – it cuts to Joel cleaning his guitar whilst telling Tommy about it. Before you get to shoot a gun, you’ll be seeing all the big revelations that were saved for later parts of the game, including that incredible dinosaur/space museum scene, Owen and Abby finding an aquarium, and more.</p>
<p>So much of The Last of Us Part 2’s early narrative was hung around this mystery about Abby and her motivations for killing Joel so close to the start of the game, those revelations being held back to be revealed in flashbacks later on. Seeing everything laid out in order bring so much more depth and understanding to Abby’s character that was, for many players, masked by the same kind of instant, uninformed hatred that Ellie felt. There is, of course, an artistic link to having players so aligned with their character, but the end result was arguably too visceral for many.</p>

<p>After the introductory scenes, as the game moves on to Seattle, the chronological reordering helps to eliminate the pacing issues that I felt with the original game. Instead of the long stretches where you see just one character’s story, where the story builds up to a huge climax, only to be sent back in time and have to wait for it to build up all over again, the two sides of the timeline are interwoven. The experience of playing two characters in opposition to each other like this is quite unique.</p>

<p>There are a few oddities that are a result of this, though I’m not sure they could have really been avoided. Specifically, because Abby and Ellie are both in the same storm at one point early in the game, you witness that storm starting up twice in quick succession, but from each perspective. It’s chronological, but there’s nothing being cut, so some of the bits overlap each other anyway, and that can be a little strange.</p>
<p>It’s also fair to say that this story and the game was not designed with a chronological telling in mind. I wasn’t exaggerating when I said you don’t fire a gun for a good two or three hours and there’s lots of stuff that was saved for the latter half of the game that take up the beginning. It’s all incredibly emotional, it looks gorgeous, and contains some of the best performances in any game ever, but it’s definitely a much slower start.</p>

<p>By contrast, recutting a film or a TV series to would be much easier, but for a more natural feeling video game, the ebb and flow of gameplay would also need to be considered and adjusted, which this mode doesn’t do. Had this game been designed with a chronological story in mind, it would have been stitched together very differently, and perhaps still have had space for some of the flashbacks, like the museum visit, to be kept in place. This is&nbsp;an imperfect solution to an imperfect problem, and it does mean that it is still better to play The Last of Us Part 2 as originally designed for the first time through, with a Chronological Mode playthrough being more rewarding as a second play.</p>
<p>I do still prefer Chronological Mode so far. I haven’t finished it – it’s a long game after all – but I’m planning to just to see how different its finale hits like this. The pacing issues were my only real issue with the standard campaign anyway, and this has improved the game for me once you get passed the slower start, seeing how both sides of this conflict react to each other’s movements in sequence. I do applaud the ambition of Naughty Dog to cast Abby as a villain for the original release and then unwrap her motivations and backstory to make her sympathetic, narratively speaking, but that’s a huge undertaking to redeem a character after seeing them only through their enemy’s eyes and one that didn’t land for a large part of the audience. I can’t help but feel that the game suffered because of that angle. Perhaps doing things in the “proper” order would’ve been better?</p>

		<p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has been released, exploring a bit more of the game’s story and world that you’ll get to explore when the game launches for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">16th October 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Make the Most of Your Adventure in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eo7PmXkP0LA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer reveals more about the story of Pokémon Legends Z-A, as your character arrives in Lumiose City and is quickly invited to join Team MZ, an organisation that is intent on protecting the city of Lumiose. In the group is Urbain or Taunie – gendered characters that will be your main buddy in the game – then the fashion desinger Naveen and aspiring dancer Lida.&nbsp;They’ll be your allies when going up against the main threats to the city.</p>
<p>Lumiose, you see, is transforming into a city that’s friendlier to both Pokémon and humans, letting them cohabit in the space. What this really means is that Pokémon will wander around in Wild Zones during the day, just waiting for you to come along and chuck a Poké Ball at their heads. During the day you’ll also be able to go shopping, changing up your character’s hair style, looks, and picking from a wide range of outfits to look all stylish. If you’ve got a Furfrou, you’ll be able to give them fancy haircuts too, like a Pokémon poodle kind of thing, and then just hang around at various spots around the city with your Pokémon.</p>


<p>By night, you’ll enter into the Z-A Royale with the Pokémon you’ve caught, looking to climb the ranks… from Z… to A. As you do so, you’ll end up facing off against bosses, such as Corbeau, the leader of the very nefarious-looking Rust Syndicate.</p>
<p>They are up to no good, I have absolutely no doubt, but there’s two other characters that will help to unpick the game’s core mystery. Emma, the so-called best detective in the city, will ask for your help to investigate things, while Mable, the acting director of the Pokémon Research Lab, will use you to pad her portfolio and CV when applying for the main job, getting you to catch Pokémon to aid in her research and then using this to claim that she’s got great management skills and is able to motivate workers to get results, all while keeping the budget in check.</p>
<p>Anyway, the big new mystery is that wild creatures are suddenly able to go Mega all on their own, with Rogue Mega Evolution Pokémon running rampant! You’ll have to Mega Evolution your own creatures to fight back, perhaps using the newly revealed Mega Dragonite, who now has wings sprouting out of its head and a big pearl on its tail.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and Switch 2, and fans will be keen to discover what this means for performance and graphics, after the frankly abysmal state of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on original Switch. That game was patched with Switch 2 support and now plays a whole lot better, but it’s still very rough on the original console. Z-A will bring improved resolution and performance to the Switch 2 Edition of the game, but how will it run on the base console?</p>

		<p>The Pokémon Company and Wallace &amp; Gromit creators Aardman Animations have announced the stop-motion animation Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d and Pichu.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu | Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om_7wKXw1XE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The animation is set to come out in 2027.</p>
<p>Little is known about The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d and Pichu, though we can infer from the teaser trailer that Pichu and Sirfetch’d get up to mischief. Don’t believe me? Well, I don’t really know what to say.</p>
<p>The trailer blurb says:</p>

<p><em>Sirfetch’d and Pichu are front and centre as the heroes of the show, which is set in a region Trainers have explored before—one that is very close to Aardman’s heart. The series will offer a unique look at the Pokémon world, told from the perspective of Pokémon, with the signature Aardman sense of character, comedy and craft.</em></p>
<p>Partnering with Aardman is sure to deliver some wonderful animation, with the studio having a litany of award-winning animated hits, starting with the original claymation Wallace &amp; Gromit shorts before getting much more ambitious with full cinematic productions like Chicken Run, The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! Shaun the Sheep Movie and last year’s TV movie Wallace &amp; Gromit Vengeance Most Fowl.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Netflix show Pokémon Concierge is set to continue with new episodes arriving on 4th September. The first season of four episodes released in 2023, with&nbsp;Dwarf Studios adapting the world of Pokémon into animated figurines and felt creatures. It’s a lovely art style.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW Pokémon Concierge Episodes ????️ | Coming September 4 to Netflix | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzL8NUUgwdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The series follows Haru, a down on her luck workaholic who gets away from it all by visiting the Pokémon Resort and becoming a concierge, working to care for Pokémon visitors to the island. The second season looks like there’s a romantic storyline.</p>

<p>Titled 'The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Aardman Animation has officially lifted the lid on its upcoming collaboration with Pokémon — and, as you'd expect, it's a TV series.</p>
<p>In today's Pokémon Presents, we got our first look at <strong>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu</strong>, a stop-motion animated series that is set in "a region Trainers have explored before—one that is very close to Aardman’s heart." Weeeeell... that sounds like Galar, doesn't it?</p>
<p>The teaser doesn't show much, though we think Wooloo could give Shaun the Sheep a run for his money here. You can also spot the little Pichu's ears and Sirfetch'd's distinctive leek sword and shield.</p>
<p>The show isn't due to air until 2027, but we're already grabbing the cheese and crackers.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the teaser in the comments</em>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-effect-tv-show-gets-the-benefit-of-having-the-same-production-team-the-fallout-tv-show-has.1249725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon's Fallout TV show was praised for a number of things, one of them being how well the creative team behind the show was able to recreate the world of Fallout for the small screen. Beyond the performances and the characters, it was a huge boon to see how much everything looked and felt like it was right out of the game, and thanks to some eagle-eyed fans, we know that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/">Mass Effect</a> show could look just as good. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Eurogamer</a>, writer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">Daniel Casey,</a> who is penning the scripts for the Mass Effect adaptation and operating as an executive producer on the show, shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCIXbiuSR5R/?igsh=a2IydzBvYmVwNGFp">last November in an Instagram post</a>, that the majority of the production team behind Fallout, will be working with him on Mass Effect. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm working on a Mass Effect show for Amazon</em>," Casey wrote. "<em>We're greenlit to start our writer's room at the top of 2025. Doing this right is and has been top priority for nearly two years now (though we paused for the strike last year). We have a great pilot script and series outline, the team that Amazon has in place (same team as Fallout including the fantastic Scott Farris) is incredible. Standby for further updates. This is gonna be the next year/two years of my life. And it'll be special</em>."</p>



<p>This doesn't ensure that the Mass Effect TV show will have the entire right look and feel, or that the characters will be stellar, or that the show will be a hit overall, but it does give the show a big leg-up. Mass Effect and Fallout are similar in that they both exist within expansive worlds, where multiply stories can be told without ever treading on the same ground the game's have already walked on. </p>



<p>It's a boon to see that many of the same people who understood the asssignment in adapting Fallout are also going to be working on Mass Effect. Hopefully, we'll learn more about the series soon.</p>

<p>The core rules for <em>Unmatched</em> are the same across all the sets (except the <em>Unmatched</em>: Tales to Amaze set, which tweaks the rules to add in solo/co-op play). Players pick their fighter, and can play 1v1, a free-for-all, or a 2v2. Then, each turn, players take 2 actions (and can pick the same action twice) from moving, attacking, or scheming.</p>

<p>Attacking and scheming require players to play an attack or scheme card from their hand, and moving lets you draw a card, and then move the amount on your character's stat card. You can also play cards to boost your move, and some abilities, attacks, and schemes also let you boost them. Play continues back and forth until only one fighter remains.</p>

<p>Although the core rules are simple and straightforward (the rulebook is 20 digest-sized pages with large text and lots of examples), the depth and strategy come from the individual characters themselves. Each character has a unique stat card and deck to give them a thematic style of play. Some characters also come with 1 or more sidekicks to add another dimension to their style of play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-3.jpg?itok=NJIrA8li 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-3.jpg?itok=o_hWYTwe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unmatched: The Witcher</em> Steel and Silver lets you choose between Geralt, Ciri and the Leshen as your fighters.</figcaption></figure>

<p><i>Unmatched: </i>Silver and Steel includes 3 characters from <em>The Witcher</em> franchise. The main protagonist of the first 3 video games, Geralt of Rivia, the protagonist of the upcoming <em>The Witcher 4</em> game, Ciri, and one of the monsters from the franchise, the forest monster, the Ancient Leshen.</p>

<p>The White Wolf, Geralt of Rivia himself, as you would expect, has an aggressive deck. Most of his cards are combat-focused, and most have additional flexibility of adding additional mobility to Gerlat, drawing cards, or discarding your opponent's cards. At the start of the game, you get to build Geralt's deck, choosing between 2 sets of Potions, Armors, and Swords depending on what you're going up against. Geralt also brings along Dandelion as his sidekick, a ranged fighter with attack cards that can move your opponent's fighters and discard cards from their hand.</p>

<p>Ciri is another aggressive fighter, but her cards aren't initially as powerful as Geralt's. Instead, most of the cards in her deck have a Source icon, and other cards gain power, depending on how many Source cards are in your discard pile. The Lion Cub of Sintra attack card, for example, has a printed value of 2, but 4 with 1 Source card in the discard pile, and 7 with 5 Source cards in the discard pile. Ciri deploys with Ihuarraquax, who has cards that let them move and damage foes after combat, and search for Source cards from the deck.</p>

<p>The Ancient Leshen has extremely powerful attacks, and also adds +3 to attack card values if it has already attacked that turn. It has 13 cards in its deck with a printed value of 4 or more. Powerful as it is, the Leshen is slow, with a move of 1, so it can be easily kept at range by your opponents. The Leshen does have cards that let it move to any space after combat, and has 2 fast wolves as sidekicks, but getting that super-powerful second attack can be a challenge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-4.jpg?itok=WrjcmZhx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unmatched-the-witcher-4.jpg?itok=YiuY4hxY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unmatched: The Witcher</em> Realms Fall lets you choose between Yennefer/Triss, Philipa and Eredin as your fighters.</figcaption></figure><h2>Realms Fall</h2>

<p><i>Unmatched: </i>Realms Fall includes 3 (technically 4) characters from <em>The Witcher</em> franchise. The powerful sorceresses and Geralt's love interests across the franchise, Yennefer and Triss, another powerful Sorceress, Philippa Eilhart, and the big bad from <em>The Witcher 3</em>,&nbsp;Eredin Bréacc Glas.</p>

<p>If you choose Yennefer and Triss, you then have to pick between them for your hero and sidekick. Both come with miniatures and sidekick tokens that represent them, and 2 stat cards depending on who you choose as the hero. Their deck remains the same, regardless of whom you choose, as most of their cards can be used by either, with 3 Yennefer and 2 Triss only cards.</p>

<p>They have a good mix of offense and defense, with Yennefer's Incinerate card having a printed attack value of 7, but can be ignored by your opponent discarding 2 cards. Triss's Merigold's Hailstorm card only has a printed attack value of 4, but your opponent must also either discard 2 cards, deal 3 damage to their hero, or discard the top 4 cards from their deck. The main difference between the pair is that if you choose Triss as the hero, her ability lets you deal 2 damage to a fighter adjacent to her after playing a scheme, and if you choose Yennefer, her ability means that attacks can be boosted.</p>

<p>Philippa and her sidekick, the powerful spymaster Dijkstra, have a defensive deck that likes to force your opponent to discard cards and cycle through their deck. Their offensive and defensive cards can block the value of your opponent's cards and also allow you to choose which card they play. Philippa's ability means that you're never short of cards yourself, and can always draw up to 4 cards at the end of your turn.</p>

<p>All of the fighters in both <em>Unmatched: The Witcher </em>boxes have ongoing scheme cards, which persist after playing as long as you meet the criteria. Philipa's Polymorph card, using her ability to turn into an Owl, means she can be placed in any space, and then her movement value is raised to 5, as long as at the end of your turn, you're not in a zone with an opposing fighter.</p>

<p>Eredin, as King of the Wild Hunt, brings along 4 Red Riders as sidekicks. You'll want to throw the Red Riders at your opponent, because once they're all off the battlefield, Eredin becomes enraged, adding 1 to all of his combat cards and boosting his move to 3.</p>

<p>Almost all of his cards gain extra abilities, usually extra damage once he's enraged, so throw your Red Riders at your opponent, and then bear down on them with Eredin for the kill. Eredin's cards aren't super powerful, but they deal consistent damage, and he can be pretty unrelenting. The Wild Hunt attack/defence card deals 1 damage to every fighter that's adjacent to one of your fighters, allowing you to remove a lot of weak sidekicks quickly with some clever positioning.</p>

<h2>Unmatched: The Witcher Realms Fall and Steel and Silver Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>In a vacuum, the<i> Unmatched: The Witcher </i>boxes give a great thematic <em>The Witcher</em> experience. Each character feels thematically unique with Geralts' changing deck options, Eredin's relentlessness, Ciri's growing power, the almost stationary but powerful Leshen, the controlling and wily Philipa, and the powerful ranged sorceress combination of Triss and Yennefer.</p>

<p>The <em>Unmatched</em> system is straightforward and extremely easy to learn, letting you focus on the strategy of the fighter you've chosen. The variation and replayability come from that variety, so the more fighters you have, the longer it lasts.</p>

<p>Both Steel and Silver and Realms Fall both have 3 fighters, so a single box definitely feels like it has a finite amount of games before things start to feel samey. Having both boxes improves that, and long-time fans of <em>Unmatched</em> will find 6 unique and fun fighters to add to their games. Fans of <em>The Witcher</em> coming into <em>Unmatched</em> with these sets will find an accessible system, a great mix of characters that feel like the characters they know and love.</p>

This is usually where we get a bunch of updates on live-service games like <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, and <em>Go</em>, as well as a more substantial look at whatever RPG is in development over at Game Freak. As expected, <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A </em>made an appearance, and there were a few surprises along the way. If you want to watch the full presentation you can do so below, but if you just want the highlights, read on.</p><h2 id="h553741"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div><div><p>The stream began with a pre-show of sorts with a DJ set hosted by a pair of DJs Pikachu. (Much like “attorneys general,” DJs Pikachu is the correct plural here.) The music selections included some pretty rad electronic remixes of classic <em>Pokémon </em>music. Release the tracks on streaming, TPC!</p></div><div><p>Kicking off the Presents is a look at the next season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, the amazing stop-motion show on Netflix. Haru is still working at the resort and has an unruly Sealeo to take care of, but she also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend Kent showing up. The show looks just as wholesome and soul-cleansing as season one. The new episodes will premiere on Netflix on September 4. </p></div><div><p>A new stop-motion series is also in development called <em>The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu. </em>The charming teaser features a Wooloo calmly grazing as all kinds of Pokemon-related shenanigans are happening just out of view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A new outdoor attraction is opening up in Japan. Made to look like a real forest and town featuring statues and attractions based on Pokémon, it’s set to open in 2026. Tickets will go on sale later this year.</p></div><div><p>Now for the game updates. <em>Pokemon Go</em>’s next Go Fest event, Max Finale, will take place on August 23 and 24, and will feature Max Pokemon, including Eternatus.</p></div><div><p>We didn’t see much of <em>Pokémon Masters EX</em> this time, but Carmine &amp; Sinistcha will join the game on July 29 as a sync pair.</p></div><div><p>A bunch of pirate-themed characters and cosmetics are coming to the puzzle game/management sim <em>Pokémon Cafe ReMix</em>, including a captain outfit for Lapras, Alolan Meowth, Totodile, and Minccino. You can also recruit a summer-themed Jigglypuff to help out at your cafe.</p></div><div><p>The Legendary Beasts are coming to <em>Pokemon Sleep</em>, so expect to see Suicune, Entei, and Raikou show up in your research in September. A new area called Amber Canyon is also coming to the game in August.</p></div><div><p>Latias is joining the MOBA <em>Pokémon Unite</em> for its fourth anniversary. Latios joined the roster on July 18, with Latias to follow on August 8. A new battle mode called Electrode Volleyball is also now available in-game.</p></div><div><p>We saw some of the new full-art Mega Evolution cards coming to the Trading Card Game, including Lucario, Gardevoir, Kangaskhan and Venusaur.</p></div><div><p>Minutes before the Presents began, a new puzzle game called <em>Pokémon Friends </em>was released on the App Store. Someone flipped a switch too early, it seems. The game centers around collecting <em>Pokémon </em>plushies by solving short puzzles in a variety of classic, traditional brainteaser formats. The game is free-to-play on mobile and apparently a $9.99 package on Switch.</p></div><div><p>After a brief mention of the game’s Switch 2 upgrades, it was announced that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>are getting new tera raids for the Treasures of Ruin, but you’ll only be able to capture them after the raids have been completed one million times across all players.</p></div><div><p>We finally saw our first footage of <em>Pokémon Champions</em>. The battle simulator includes ranked play, private battles, and a new training mode that lets you alter monster stats and move pools, and really craft your team. It’s coming to Switch and mobile in 2026.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show is a new look at <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. We started with a pretty slick trailer showing the main character running around the city, meeting new characters, and trying on new clothes, with their Pokémon following them around the whole time. The presentation focused on the story, cast, and what you can do in the moment-to-moment, but it also revealed one new Mega Evolution: Dragonite, which brings back some of the visual elements of its previous evolution, Dragonair, such as wings on its head and a pearl on its tail. And that was it. Alrighty then. The game looks really cool and there’s some exciting stuff here, but I was hoping for a more substantial blow-out on the rumored Mega Evolutions. Maybe they just want to keep those under wraps until the game comes out on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682]]></content:encoded>

It's believed that this arcade cabinet has been installed within Namco Funscape for testing, with early bugs ironed out after public play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Shot's first episode is its prologue, with a second episode titled "Hunted". Loading up the prologue, the game then introduces Resident Evil 2's setting to players: "Leon and Claire find one another on the streets of Raccoon City. Chased by zombies, they evacuate to the police department only to discover further horrors within."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you select your episode, a zombified hand shatters through the screen, pulling you (and your co-op partner) in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening section sees Leon and Claire fighting their way into the Raccoon City Police Department, past zombie cops and zombie dogs. The game's visuals appear to be based on Capcom's 2019 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Resident Evil Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once inside the building, the pair introduce themselves to each other before more zombie cops interrupt the party. Still, there's time for a little bit of exposition from just-about-still-alive cop Marvin Branagh, before the action continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with other arcade lightgun games, you'll need to point the gun away from the screen and pull the trigger to reload. You'll automatically reload when you run out of bullets, but manual reloading is faster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how long Resident Evil 2: Dead Shot will remain playable at Namco Funscape, but if you're headed down in the near future look out for the neon red-lit cabinet with images of Leon, Claire and Ada Wong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's intriguing to see the Resident Evil series featuring Raccoon City here once again, ahead of the franchise's 30th anniversary next year, and the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Requiem will see a return to the "overarching narrative" of Resident Evil begun 30 years ago</a>, and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brief-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-reveals-first-person-footage">early trailer has already featured the reappearance of the RCPD</a> — albeit after its later destruction in Resident Evil 3.

Most seeds won't grow in regular dirt, so you'll need to do some work to it before you can start a farm. It's best to protect your designated farm plots with a fence to keep out any unwanted mobs.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_make_farm_plots">How to make farm plots</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529998-farmplotexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529998" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529998-farmplotexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529998"></a><figcaption>9x9 farmland example with one water block in the center</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529998-farmplotexample.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First, craft the hoe tool, which allows you to turn dirt blocks into farmland. You can then place most types of crops in the game in these blocks of land. You'll also need a water source, but you don't need a lot to water the crops. One block of water will hydrate a 9x9 section of farmland when you place the water in the center square.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crop_farming_tips">Crop farming tips</h3><p dir="ltr">Light is also important for most of the crops, but it doesn't need to be natural light. You can grow crops indoors as long as you place plenty of light sources around the area. An example of indoor farming can be seen in the image below. You'll also want to put torches around your outside crops to keep them growing at night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529999-potatocrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529999" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529999-potatocrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529999"></a><figcaption>Indoor farming with potato crops using torches as light</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529999-potatocrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To farm faster, use bone meal directly on the plants to accelerate crop growth.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, some crops will have more specific water and growing requirements, and we'll discuss those in the sections below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Each_growable_crop_in_Minecraft">Each growable crop in Minecraft</h2><p dir="ltr">In the sections below, we'll guide you through finding and planting each type of growable crop in Minecraft.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_grow_wheat">How to grow wheat</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530000-wheatcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530000" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530000-wheatcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530000"></a><figcaption>Wheat crops</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530000-wheatcrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Wheat seeds are obtained by breaking normal grass. This is one of the easiest crops to get started with, as the seeds are very abundant. You must plant the seeds on tilled farmland with at least one water block, as mentioned above.

These seeds can be found in villages or chests, and you'll need to plant them in farm plots just like the carrots, potatoes, and wheat. These seeds follow the same rule of a 9x9 section of farmland with one water block, as mentioned above.</p><p dir="ltr">Beetroot is used for crafting red dye and cooking the Beetroot Soup recipe.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_grow_pumpkins">How to grow pumpkins</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530002-pumpkinfarming.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530002" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530002-pumpkinfarming.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530002"></a><figcaption>Pumpkin farming</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530002-pumpkinfarming.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll need seeds to grow pumpkins. These can be easily gained from harvesting pumpkins found in grassy areas, but you can also randomly loot them from chests.</p><p dir="ltr">The pumpkin seeds must be planted in farmland to grow, and these follow the light and water requirements of the other crops mentioned so far. The slight difference here is that the pumpkins will grow on a block adjacent to where you planted it, so these crops need slightly more room than others. You can still use the 9x9 farm plots with pumpkins, but some people prefer to organize the pumpkins in double rows, as shown in the image above.</p><p dir="ltr">Pumpkins can be used to make pumpkin pie.

Harvesting is the best way to get seeds, but you can also randomly loot them from chests.</p><p dir="ltr">Melon seeds must be planted in farmland to grow, and these follow the light and water requirements of pumpkins and other crops mentioned so far. Melons grow in the same formation as the pumpkins mentioned above, meaning they also require at least one adjacent block of space that is open.</p><p dir="ltr">Melons can be eaten and also used to craft Glistering Melons.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_grow_sugar_cane">How to grow sugar cane</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530004-sugarcane.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530004" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530004-sugarcane.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530004"></a><figcaption>Sugar cane planted in sand by the water</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530004-sugarcane.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sugar cane naturally grows near bodies of water. Just head to your nearest river, lake, or seaside and break the sugar cane that's growing to harvest it.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike most crops, sugar cane doesn't use farmland to grow. Sugar cane stalks can only be planted on sand and dirt blocks, and they must be next to water. To harvest your crops, you want to make sure you only break one block above the stalk in the ground. This avoids any need to replant the sugar cane.</p><p dir="ltr">Sugar cane is used for making resources like sugar and paper.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_grow_cocoa_beans">How to grow cocoa beans</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530005-cocoapods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530005" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530005-cocoapods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530005"></a><figcaption>Cocoa pods in the jungle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530005-cocoapods.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cocoa beans can be harvested from the cocoa pods growing on trees in the jungle biome. Cocoa can only grow on jungle wood, so while you're in the jungle, you'll want to also harvest some jungle wood. You don't need to place it on full jungle trees, though; these pods can grow on jungle logs or planks as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Cocoa beans are used for making cookies and brown dye.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_grow_Nether_wart">How to grow Nether wart</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530019-6b657cf7-6255-4d90-8226-879993519479.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530019" data-ratio="0.56270491803279" data-width="2440" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530019-6b657cf7-6255-4d90-8226-879993519479.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530019"></a><figcaption>Nether wart in soul sand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530019-6b657cf7-6255-4d90-8226-879993519479.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like the name suggests, Nether wart is found exclusively in the Nether.

Harvesting giant mushrooms gives you the chance of looting regular mushrooms, with the color depending on the type you're harvesting.</p><p dir="ltr">Mushrooms need to be planted in low-light areas.

                <p>As part of the Pokemon Presents presentation, The Pokemon Company announced a brand-new Pokemon game for Switch 2, and you don't have to wait to play it.</p><p>Pokemon Friends is a new puzzle game out now that aims to "help untangle your mind." Players solve random puzzles and place the yarn they earn into a "Plush-O-Matic" to get an in-game Pokemon plush.</p><p>"As you try to make them all, you can track your crafted plush in the catalog. You can also mark your calendar with a stamp each day you play, and then go back and practice the puzzles you played on those days," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNJb21AX0-4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qNJb21AX0-4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players will also encounter strangers in the game world who will ask you to bring them a specific plush. Completing these quests unlocks those plushes and increases your friendship level with townsfolk. "Grateful townspeople will give rewards, including furniture, which you can use to decorate your in-game plush rooms," the game's description says.</p><p>Pokemon Friends is also available on mobile devices as a free download, but on Switch and Switch 2, it's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for $10 from the eShop.</a> This includes the Basic Pack, which comes with 30 puzzles, 70 craftable plushies, and 11 yarn types. There are more microtransactions, too, including Puzzle Packs 1 and 2, which add more puzzles to the game. They cost $15 on their own or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/puzzle-on-bundle-packs-1-and-2-70070000029782-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$26 in a bundle with both.</a></p><p>The announcement of Pokemon Friends came during the Pokemon Presents broadcast, which also featured numerous other announcements, including more details on a real-like Pokemon park. Check out the gallery below to get a rundown of all the major announcements.</p>

                <p>Ironmouse, a female VTuber widely considered the most successful on Twitch, has announced that she is leaving the agency that represents her. Ironmouse has been part of the VShojo agency since November 2020, but in a video posted to <a href="https://youtu.be/MwLbGcUMy6g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">her YouTube channel</a>, she alleges that the company owes her "a significant amount of funds," and that it failed to donate more than $515,000 that she raised for the Immunodeficiency Foundation charity.</p><p>Ironmouse has a rare primary immune deficiency disease known as Common Variable Immunodeficiency, or CVID, meaning that she has a low- to near-non-functioning immune system. This disease means that Mouse spends almost all of her time bedridden, getting sick a lot, and having to remain isolated. When Ironmouse began streaming, she just wanted to see if she could "make some friends" but she was afraid to show her real face online. That's when a friend suggested that she try using an anime avatar, and she became a VTuber.</p><p>After being approached to join VShojo in 2020, Mouse says she spent a long time "considering" whether she could become a corporate VTuber or not. Ultimately, she decided that the benefits of retaining her anonymity and having VShojo handle her payments were good reasons to proceed, and she joined the company in November of 2020. Since then, she and her online friend<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPsZ_0SkFdi551iYTG04R2g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> CDawg</a>, real name Connor, have raised more than $4 million for the Immunodeficiency Foundation through online subathons, where viewers contribute subscriptions on Twitch to raise money for the charity, Cycleathons, where Connor will cycle an extended distance taking donations, and other charitable events.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLbGcUMy6g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MwLbGcUMy6g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ironmouse has done two subathons during which she decided to donate half of her revenue to the Immunodeficiency Foundation. The first of these she says went off without a hitch, and VShojo--as the company handling her Twitch payments--successfully donated more than $329,000 to the Immunodeficiency Foundation. Her second subathon in September 2024 saw her beat the all-time Twitch subscriber record of 306,621 previously held by Kai Cenat. This meant that over $515,000 had been raised for the Immunodeficiency Foundation, and once again Ironmouse says she asked VShojo to make the donation on her behalf. "Unfortunately, still a year later, VShojo has not paid the charity," she explains.</p><p>Ironmouse explains that the Immunodeficiency Foundation is a charity that helped her immensely when she was going through her diagnosis, feeling "scared" and unsure of what would happen next. "This entire situation has broken me. I just wanted to do something good and to give back to a community that helped me, but unfortunately that's not the case," she continues. Mouse goes on to confirm that she wishes she could talk in more depth about the situation, but that she has been advised to wait for legal proceedings.</p><p>In solidarity with Ironmouse, other VTubers that are represented by VShojo have begun to remove the agency's name from their social media handles, and informing their communities that they will be streaming soon to explain what their next steps are--raising the question of whether the controversial situation could cause other talents to leave VShojo, too.</p><p>VTuber Kson has <a href="https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently streamed</a> to announce her departure from the agency, and alleged that VShojo has failed to pay her since September 2024. "I have been lied to from the company a lot about the situation," she explained, "My payments stopped last September. I was asking what's going on for a long time, multiple times. All they said was, 'It's going to be paid,' and it was never paid, and I think it will never be." Kson continues to explain that the reason she waited so long to reveal the information and quit the agency is due to doubts that the money would ever be paid. "That was scary for me," she said.</p><p>Kuro has <a href="https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also announced</a> that he "submitted a leave contract" 11 days ago--it's unclear whether he was aware of Ironmouse's situation at the time of submitting that request. </p><p>VShojo had been under scrutiny recently as three of its talents left the agency since May 2025, as well as the former CMO and director of talent both resigning. VTubers who were formerly members of VShojo have also spoken out about the Ironmouse situation, with Zentreya--who left the agency earlier this month--posting that her "heart hurts for the VShojo community" and encouraging people to support one another. Current VShojo members Kuro Kurenai, Apricot, Henya, Hime Hajime, AmaLee, and Michi Mochievee publicly issued support for Ironmouse.</p><p>Ironmouse has published a <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify link </a>that is raising funds directly for the Immunodeficiency Foundation. At the time of writing it has raised over $334,000. She will continue to stream as an independent VTuber.</p>

The player will be recruited into Team MZ as soon as the game begins, and they'll be introduced to Naveen, Lida, Urbain, Taunie, and the rest of the team soon after.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo7PmXkP0LA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Eo7PmXkP0LA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players will also meet Emma, a detective in need of help with some cases around the city, and Mable, a researcher who asks the player to catch Pokemon for help with research. The trailer also introduced Rogue Mega Evolutions--special in-game battles against particularly tough boss characters--as well as a new Mega Evolution for Dragonite.</p><p>Scheduled to launch on October 16 for both Switch 2 and Switch, Pokemon Legends: Z-A takes players back to the Kalos region and Lumiose City for a new adventure. The Paris-inspired city was introduced in Pokemon X and Y for the Nintendo 3DS, and since then, the vibrant metropolis has undergone some significant urban redevelopment.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-its-big-twist-on-gameplay/1100-6530425/" data-ref-id="1100-6530425">There have also been some big changes</a> to the gameplay of this Pokemon game, as players will duke it out in Pokemon battles that are held from dusk til' dawn as they seek to level up in the the Z-A Royale tournament.</p><p>Combat unfolds in real time instead of the turn-based format from most Pokemon games, and positioning plays a key role in determining victory. Players will be able to enter Battle Zones to take on other trainers and improve their overall ranking in the game's tournament. On top of that, the game will also offer new characters to meet and plenty of wild Pokemon to capture.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Announced earlier this year, Pokémon Champions appears poised to become the successor to old favorites like Pokémon Stadium, but we haven't learned much about the game to this point. That changed today, thanks to a new trailer from The Pokémon Works, detailing some of what players should expect with the upcoming battle-focused title.</p><p>Similar to Pokémon Stadium, players can import the Pokémon caught on their mainline game journeys. This time, it's done through Pokémon Home. However, you can also recruit Pokémon to join their teams, including Trial Recruitments that allow Pokémon to join your team for a limited time. To permanently recruit a Pokémon, you must use Victory Points, earned through methods like winning Ranked Battles. Victory Points can also be used to train Pokémon and fine-tune their stats and moves.</p><p>Once you have your team, you can compete in Ranked Battles or Casual Battles against trainers around the world, or Private Battles against friends. Battles can also be traditional Single Battles or more chaotic Double Battles.&nbsp;</p><p>Pokémon Champions is set to arrive on Switch, iOS, and Android in 2026. If you'd rather not wait to get your battling fix, Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Stadium 2 are available on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library on Switch 2 and Switch, and Pokémon Colosseum is confirmed to come to the Switch 2 GameCube collection in the future.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2025/07/22/new-trailer-shares-more-info-about-pokemon-champions]]></content:encoded>

Today's livestream added another app to this lineup -- <a href="https://www.pokemon-friends.jp/en/">Pokémon Friends</a>, a daily puzzle game for Switch and mobile. While it may look like the other free games, it's a bit more complicated than that.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNJb21AX0-4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNJb21AX0-4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer shows off a variety of simple puzzle formats, like one where you connect a line of lightbulbs in a single stroke, a slide puzzle where you direct water from one side of the screen to another, and a challenge where you rotate railroad tracks to create a path for a cart. When you complete puzzles, you get in-game plushes of Pokémon you can use to decorate some in-game rooms. According to the game's listing on the iOS App Store, the game has "over 1,200 puzzles" as well as "up to five save files," so families can have separate progress on a shared device. The trailer shows kids of all ages playing, including with their parents, so it seems geared towards a slightly younger audience.</p><p>However, while the game is free to download on mobile devices, it costs $9.99 on Switch in the United States. The FAQ section of the official Pokémon Friends site breaks it down; essentially, <a href="https://www.pokemon-friends.jp/en/dlc/">the Switch version comes with the Basic Pack</a>, a DLC bundle that allows players to do an unlimited number of puzzles per day. You can purchase the Basic Pack on mobile too, but it's a base feature of the Switch version. <a href="https://www.pokemon-friends.jp/en/dlc/lineup/">There are also two more DLC options</a> – Puzzle On Pack #1 and #1 – that are available to buy from day one as standalone packages or in bundles.</p><p>It's a confusing monetization system, but it seems like if you just want to give the game a try, you should download the free version on mobile before committing to the console version. The game is available today on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-friends/id6741408067">the App Store</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonfriends">Google Play</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2025/07/22/pokemon-friends-is-out-today-for-free-on-mobile-but-10-on-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During today's Pokémon Presents, we learned more about the upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-october-release-date-switch-2-edition-upgrade-confirmed">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> through a new trailer. Framed through the Nintendo Switch 2 Version, we learned a lot about the story, characters, and boss battles players will be able to participate in within this version of Lumiose City.</p><p>In the new trailer, we learn about the strange anomaly that players will investigate, where wild Pokémon are Mega Evolving and causing trouble. These Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon lose control and appear to play out as boss battles, similar to the Frenzied Nobles in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. In the Pokémon Presents trailer, it shows a battle against a Rogue Mega Evolved Tyranitar. You can even Mega Evolve your own Pokémon, including the new Mega Evolution of Dragonite, and it looks like you can fight alongside another trainer in these boss battles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Lumiose City strives to be for both people and Pokémon. During the day, you can traverse the city, catching Pokémon and exploring. However, at night, the strongest trainers emerge to battle to improve their rankings and advance in the Z-A Royale. Team MZ is formed to protect Lumiose and consists of fashion designer Naveen, dancer Lida, and others. Your player character appears to join Team MZ to help with its mission. We also see the Rust Syndicate, the team that undoubtedly serves as your rival, led by Corbeau, who also appears to have business with Team MZ.&nbsp;</p><p>While not battling, you can explore, customize your character's looks and outfit, and even give your Furfrou a haircut. You can also take photos with your Pokémon or relax at a café. Along the way, you can help Emma, a detective in Lumiose City, assist Mable, the director of the Pokémon Research Lab, with her research, and complete side objectives for other characters around the city.&nbsp;</p><p>There's still much we don't know about Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but we're excited to learn more in the lead up to it arriving on Switch 2 and Switch on October 16.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2025/07/22/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-details-supporting-characters-and-mega]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo is releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> bundle which will include both the console and upcoming release, Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>Of course, this bundle will include the Switch 2 edition of the game, which the team previously said will boast improved graphics and frame rates.</p>
<p>Those interested in picking up this bundle will be able to pre-order from tomorrow, 23rd July. The bundle will then launch on 16th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced">when Pokémon Legends: Z-A itself finally releases</a>. I have popped an email over to Nintendo to check pricing, and will update when I hear back. </p>

<p>Nintendo has previously bundled games with its consoles. On Switch 2's launch last month, many opted for the console that came with a downloadable <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> code.</p>
<p>As for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, here's what the official blurb says: "Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a new frontier for the Pokémon video game series, blending an RPG story unfolding in a single city with action elements and a real-time battle system unlike anything seen before in the franchise.</p>
<p>"Trainers can look forward to the beginning of a new adventure in Lumiose City - one woven by people and Pokémon together!"</p> <div>

<p>The iconic gen one dragon hasn't previously had an evolved form, but this new game will introduce its mega evolved form as part of the game's story.</p>
<p>It's set in Lumiose City, part of the Kalos region from gen six, and will feature wild pokémon that have begun mega evolving on their own and gone rogue. It'll be down to players, alongside Team MZ, to take them down.</p>

<p>Team MZ are the protectors of Lumiose city, and includes fashion designer Naveen and professional dancer Lida. Other characters in the game include detective Emma and Pokémon Research Lab director Mable.</p>
<p>During the daytime, players will explore the city, find pokémon to add to their party, customise their characters and pokémon, and help out the citizens in side quests.</p>
<p>At night, they'll take part in the Z-A Royale, competing against powerful trainers to climb the ranks.</p>
<p>All footage shown in the new trailer was seemingly from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> edition of the game, though it honestly still looks pretty basic visually. On the new console, players can expect improved graphics and frame rates.</p>
<p>The game will release on 16th October this year, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced">announced back in May</a>, across both Switch 1 and Switch 2. The Pokémon Company has already shown a fair amount of the game, so now we're just waiting on that release to try it for ourselves.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is something of a spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-budget-bare-minimum-or-the-series-purest-form">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, released back in 2022.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive/">Saber Interactive</a> and Boss Team Games are bringing an iconic horror franchise back to life&nbsp; with Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, a single-player survival horror action game set in the flesh-ripping world of Hellraiser.&nbsp; They’ve also managed to persuade actor Doug Bradley to return to the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Hellraiser, or at least the books and the first movie, have always leaned heavily into sex and BDSM where pain also means pleasure, and judging by the trailer Boss Team Games have kept that element as it begins with a very intimate scene.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The fact that the game looks so authentic may have something to do with Clive Barker himself being onboard for Hellraiser: Revival.</p>
<p>“Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings,” said Barker. “The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence—the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque—and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p>

<p>Hellraiser: Revival follows Aiden who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration puzzle box and save his girlfriend from the clutches of Pinhead himself. The puzzle box is not just the McGuffin for the game, you can use it to unleash hellish powers while you battle the Cenobites.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-tease-horror-game-hellraiser/">Last week,</a> Saber Interactive teased a new horror game that was set to be revealed this morning, and almost immediately, players picked up on it potentially being a Hellraiser game. Well, today we found out that those suspicions were correct, as Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games announced a survival horror Hellraiser game, called Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival.</p>



<p>In an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/22/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival/"> Xbox Wire</a> post, executive producer on Hellraiser: Revival, Nenad Tomic, describes the game as "<em>single-player, survival horror action game</em>," and as a "<em>story-driven</em>" game where players will step into the role of Aidan. As the trailer teases at the start, when a mysterious puzzle box, the Genesis Configuration, pulls his girlfriend Sunny into the hands of Pinhead, it's Aidan's job to save her, using the box to pull her out of the Labyrinth and bring her home. Presumably so they can continue where they're interrupted in the trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Clive Barker, who fans will recognize as the writer behind The Hellbound Heart, the book that he eventually adapted to the first Hellraiser film, has "<em>been deeply involved with the game from the very beginning</em>," according to Tomic, as Barker has been helping guide Saber's hand "<em>from the visual style and story motifs to the lore and the character personalities, his creative input has ensured that the game remains authentic to the spirit of Hellraiser</em>."</p>



<p>In a press release for the game's reveal, Barker added, "<em>Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings. The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding Hellraiser lore, Tomic continues that this game borrows from the first two Hellraiser films, but is a new story in the world of Hellraiser, and does not have a direct narrative connection to the films. Fans of the series will however recognize elements of the Hellraiser world, including of course the Genesis Configuration, and the Cenobites.</p>

<p>While Tomic stops short of saying when Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival will be out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, he does say that "<em>it's closer than you think</em>," and adds that more of the game will be shown later this year. Which means we could be looking at a late-2025 release, and since it's a horror game, there's always the possibility that it is aiming to be out sometime in October. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-geforce-driver-optimized-for-wuchang-fallen-feathers-killing-floor-3-both-with-dlss-4-mfg/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 577.00) optimized for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers</a> and Killing Floor 3. Both PC games are scheduled to launch on July 24.</p>



<p>The first one, developed by Leenzee and published by 505 Games, is a soulslike action roleplaying game set in the land of Shu during a fantasy rendition of the late Ming dynasty (seventeenth century). In WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, the land is plagued by warring factions and a mysterious illness that spawns monstrous creatures. Players take the role of the titular Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior afflicted with amnesia and the aforementioned horrific Feathering disease, who must navigate the uncertainties of her mysterious past. </p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers features day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA Reflex. According to NVIDIA, at 4K resolution and max settings, DLSS can boost performance by an average of 5.9X on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which can enable all of those technologies. More specifically, the RTX 5090 averages 312 frames per second, the RTX 5080 211 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti 185 FPS. Stay tuned on Wccftech to read our full review of this new Soulslike game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the same day, Tripwire Interactive is releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a>, the latest chapter in the cooperative zombie-killing shooter series. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game allows GeForce RTX owners to accelerate performance by activating NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Those with high enough frame rates can ditch the latter for improved image quality with DLAA. Of course, NVIDIA Reflex is also available to improve responsiveness.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dlss-191-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Another Unreal Engine 5 game, the free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter The First Descendant, is receiving an update on July 24 to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supported</a> Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and several ray traced effects.</p>



<p>Today marks the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-qa-were-definitely-thinking-about-joining-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildgate</a>, Moonshot Games and Dreamhaven's player-versus-player shooter game, which features built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution with the latest transformer model. Lastly, next week Riot Games will upgrade Valorant to Unreal Engine 5, retaining the existing support for NVIDIA Reflex.</p>

<h2>PokePark Kanto is opening in 2026</h2>

<p>PokePark Kanto, the first "permanent outdoor&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>attraction", will be opening in 2026 in Japan's Yomiuriland amusement park. It looks like the perfect holiday destination if you want to immerse yourself in a world of real-life Pokemon (well, as close as you're going to get, anyhow).</p>



<p>Next, we got a series of announcements regarding ongoing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>mobile games.&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Fest Max Finale 2025 was first up, and it'll see Max Pokemon appearing, with Eternatus making its debut in the game as well.</p>

<p>Over in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>, you can look forward to battling Carmine and Sinistcha, and you can log in now to get a 3,000-gem gift.&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe Remix</em>, meanwhile, is getting a very cute Lapras sea captain outfit, which is coming tomorrow.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Unite</em>'s fourth anniversary is bringing Latios and Latias into the fray, and Pawmi, Pawmo, and Pawmot are also set to make an appearance in the game soon.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Friends&nbsp;</em>is a cute mobile puzzler</h2>

It's a puzzle game that sees you connecting various things, like tracks, bulbs, or ice paths, to help little critters reach their goals.</p>

<p>You'll gain plushes for solving puzzles, and you can use them to decorate in-game plush rooms. The game is coming to Switch, Android, and iOS later today.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>are getting new Tera Raid Battle Events</h2>

<p>Shiny versions of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>'s Ruinous Quartet are coming starting from tomorrow. You can add them to your team, but each Pokemon will need to be defeated a million times (in total, not just by you) to get them.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Champions&nbsp;</em>gets more info</h2>

<p>Next up, we got to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, an upcoming battler that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">revealed back in February</a>. The game is planned for release in 2026 on Switch and mobile devices, and it looks like a fun way to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>battling.</p>

<h2>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-dragonite-pokemon-presents-july-2025.jpg?itok=lKEupujN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-dragonite-pokemon-presents-july-2025.jpg?itok=IONpUK-a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at its little wings! D'awww.</figcaption></figure><p>The last thing we got to see as part of today's presentation was a new look at&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">planned for release in October</a>. Sorry, hopeful&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>fans; doesn't look like you're getting a Gen 10 reveal today.</p>

<p>The new trailer revealed Team MZ, an organization devoted to protecting Lumiose, where the game takes place. The game's day-night cycle was also revealed; you'll explore and catch Pokemon by day, then take part in the Z-A Royale tournament event by night.</p>

<p>This game's villainous team is the Rust Syndicate, headed up by the rather sinister-looking Corbeau. He's got "some kind of business with the members of Team MZ", but you'll have to play the game to find out what that is.</p>

<p>We got a look at a Mega Evolution for Dragonite as well, which is pretty cute. It's got Dragonair-like adornments on its head and tail, and it was shown off as part of a new storyline in the game that involves Pokemon Mega Evolving by themselves.</p>

<hr><p>That's all for today! Join us again whenever the next Pokemon Presents airs, and we'll do it all again!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive spent the last week teasing a big announcement, and now it’s finally been revealed: <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em>. The first proper, single-player adaptation of the famous horror franchise showcases the return of Pinhead actor Doug Bradley and includes a red-band version of the trailer you won’t find on YouTube.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to save his girlfriend from a hellish abyss,” reads the official description for <em>Hellraiser</em>. “Playing as Aidan, you will harness the box’s infernal abilities in order to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and his Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will become a legend, even in Hell.”</p><p>Horror makes me queasy, and I’ve never been able to sit through an entire <em>Hellraiser</em> movie before. So, it didn’t take much for the game’s first official trailer to gross me out. But the real <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> trailer is actually only hosted on the game’s website. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hellraisergame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hellraisergame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It does not hold back</a></span>. I can’t embed that one, though, so here’s the YouTube version:</p><p>It shows Aiden and his unnamed girlfriend having sex before she solves the puzzle box, summons the Cenobites, and is subsequently ripped apart by chains as the extra-dimensional, sadomasochistic cult is wont to do. Taking the women in refrigerators trope to new hellish depths, we then get a quick sizzle reel of Aiden using melee weapons to beat the crap out of various monstrosities. No release date was teased, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> Saber Interactive is making <em>Hellraiser: Revival </em>with Boss Team Games, who it previously collaborated with for<em> Evil Dead: The Game</em>. However, that adaptation, which featured the return of Bruce Campbell but faced mixed reviews over its lack of content, was primarily an asymmetric multiplayer game. <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> looking like a traditional first-person action adventure should be a lot more reassuring to fans who want another story in that universe rather than another knock-off of<em> Dead by Daylight</em>. </p><p>Saber Interactive confirms this is a brand-new Hellraiser story within the established canon. The most recent film was the 2022 reboot directed by David Bruckner. While no sequel has been announced, one is reportedly in the works. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hellraiser-pinhead-doug-bradley-red-band-trailer-saber-1851786676]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Billionaire video game industry veteran Gabe Newell, the founder of Valve, has shared his thoughts on the role that artificial intelligence could play in the future of technology.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFctkKv6RM&amp;t=1s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Zalkar Saliev</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/gabe-newell-says-ai-is-a-significant-technology-transition-on-a-par-with-the-emergence-of-computers-or-the-internet-and-will-be-a-cheat-code-for-people-who-want-to-take-advantage-of-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>) from his yacht, Newell said he thinks it's "incredibly obvious" that machine learning and AI systems are going to "profoundly impact pretty much every single business." He said we could be looking at a huge technology transition on par with the arrival of the computer and the internet.</p><p>"So if I had to point to a technology transition to get in front of, it's to figure out how to use AI to do anything better. If you wanna be an accountant, learn AI, if you want to be an attorney, learn AI, if you're gonna be a programmer, you know, make sure that you know how to use the tools that are comfortable with those programming concepts. That all seems super obvious," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFctkKv6RM" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IPFctkKv6RM?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Newell went on to say that people who reacted quickly when the internet came online years ago reaped the benefits of embracing the new technology, and something similar could happen with AI.</p><p>"On the internet there were the companies and individuals who saw the opportunity and took advantage of those opportunities to create more value either as an individual or as a corporation and they zoomed ahead of everybody else," Newell said. "So essentially AI is going to be a cheat code for people who want to take advantage of it."</p><p>That Newell is a big believer in AI is not a surprise. After all, he is a <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">co-founder of Starfish</a>, a neural network company similar to Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Starfish uses AI systems to fuel its research.</p><p>AI has been a major player in the world of technology and video games for some time already, but its expansion seems to be accelerating in part through evolutions of the technology, including generative AI. Nvidia, which supplies some of the hardware used to propel AI advancements, is reaping the benefits of late, recently becoming the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most valuable company in the world with more than $4 trillion in market cap.</a></p><p>Exactly how advancements to AI might impact jobs in gaming, and all sectors, remains to be seen, but some have expressed fear about job losses. In fact, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">job losses due to AI are coming</a>, but overall hiring will increase due to the number of new jobs created.</p><p>In related news, the video game voice actor strike recently ended, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">one of the major sticking points being protections against AI. </a></p>
