		<p>Ever since watching Honey, I Shrunk The Kids on VHS – yes, I am that old – I’ve had a fascination with viewing our natural worldfrom a different perspective. My son has inherited this from me, with ants, bugs and creatures often taking up residence in our home, and only occasionally escaping from whatever abode we’ve housed them in. Grounded 2 is a game built on that same generational fascination, the wonder of this known, but unknown, landscape, and the incredible creatures that live there. Oh, and being able to ride on them, that’s important too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grounded 2 - Early Access Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Shyth7f8zd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Few games have managed to make our natural world feel so alien, or the few metres of a grass lawn as expansive as the original Grounded. It was a game that started life in Early Access, growing steadily with its community’s input, and becoming a clear jewel in the Xbox pantheon. They’re hoping that the same path will work for the sequel, and in Grounded 2, it’s not so much that bigger is better, but rather that this is small, but perfectly formed.</p>


<p>I love games that let you choose between first and third person, and from the off, that puts Grounded 2 in my good books. It really helps you to have either a sense of scale, or a sense of immediacy, and you can switch between the two in the pause menu. I’d have preferred it to be on a simple button press or stick click, but I’ll live with it.</p>
<p>You have the same four characters to choose from, with Max, Willow, Pete and Hoops all looking like kids that loiter in the street, but appear more likely to help you in with your shopping than steal it. Set in the 80s, there’s a touch of Kid N Play about Max and a smidgen of, well, Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, about Pete, to give you a really strong sense of time and place.</p>


<p>If you were a kid then yourself, there’s plenty of nods to your childhood to keep you chuckling away too, especially through the opening cutscene. Even if you weren’t, the writing throughout is just perfectly weighted, and genuinely funny.</p>
<p>Ominent, headed by the worryingly cheery Sloane Beaumont, are the big bad company here, and they’re clearly up to no good, drawing the four kids into a murky world of scientific shenanigans and missing minors. There’s a nice lightness of tone to these early moments with the game, and they’ve definitely captured the miniaturised person movie vibes.</p>
<p>You find yourself shrunk down, and making your way through a damaged facility, where it turns out you’ve been recruited as an employee of Ominent. Actually, when I say recruited, I mean kidnapped using an explosion to cover up what’s happened.</p>
<p>From here, you’re embarking on a survival crafting adventure that’s keen to give you a whole heap of control and options, without necessarily explaining them all. If you’ve been playing the original recently, then this might feel easier, but with my last time with Grounded coming a number of years ago, it feels pretty full on. I think the onboarding experience just needs a little tweak though, since it’s also immediately engaging, and gives you plenty to do and focus on from the off.</p>

<p>That starts with foraging, grabbing everything in sight, before moving onto more active resource collection using your axe, hammer or shovel. Each item you collect can then be analysed, unlocking further knowledge about its uses, or new recipes that it’s a component of.</p>
<p>This is a classic survival game, so whatever you’re building, you need to think about food and water. It’s way too easy to get carried away building and collecting before you suddenly get told you’re going to die in two minutes. If you do die – which you probably will – you just respawn, and need to find your way back to your backpack in order to collect everything you had. It doesn’t feel overly punishing, but you’ll be a lot warier after the first time it happens.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of combat against an array of bugs and creatures in Grounded 2, and Obsidian have made it more varied and exciting than the original, with weapon specialisations that can turn you into a mage, knight or dual-wielding assassin. There’s currently fewer enemy types, but I expect we’ll see a steady stream of them as the game continues development. Combat definitely feels better in first person, with a level of accuracy there that third-person can’t match. I’m not sure how much Obsidian can do to remedy that, but here’s hoping they can make a few tweaks.</p>
<p>For all that the first steps felt full-on, Grounded 2 does a great job of making its natural world feel connected and intuitive. From things like having to knock down a particular type of grass to get grass seeds, to the way that ants will steel food from your cooking spit, this feels like a real, living world, and it’s a constant delight thanks to that sense of realism and natural discovery.</p>

<p>Grounded 2 looks great. It builds on the original’s art design and layers on a modern sheen of enhancements, making it a genuine looker, especially within the survival/crafting genre. Brookhollow Park might be a regular park, but Obsidian have found clever ways to make different areas have distinct looks, including frozen wilds thanks to an ice cream truck. Performance on PC is mostly stable, though as you build up your base and come across more enemies, the frame rate can definitely take a bit of a hit.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 already has a clear advantage over its predecessor, taking everything that worked well in the original while making smart changes to various mechanics, making things more natural and easier to live with. I can’t wait to see where it heads over the coming months, as it feels like Grounded 2 could be another essential title for Obsidian and Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rapidly approaching new NFL season also means a new Madden game to enjoy, with Madden 26 now available. While all eyes may be on your offense, having a strong defense is crucial, so we’ve selected some of the best defensive playbooks.</p>



<p>Regardless of your game mode of choice, defensive playbooks are vital for success in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a>, even if you’ve settled into a strong offensive output using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-offensive-playbooks-madden-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best offensive playbooks</a> in the game. </p>



<p>Rather than sifting through all the teams to find the right defensive playbook for you, however, we can make things much easier by pointing you in the direction of the best defensive playbooks Madden 26 has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Defensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rock solid. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>With a variety of strong formations, the Green Bay Packers’ defensive playbook is a solid choice, particularly when you’re just starting to get to grips with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. With 4-3 and 4-6 formations included, it’s great for defending against both the running and passing game.</p>



<p>One of the biggest strengths, however, is the variety of Nickel approaches, putting your Linebackers pretty much anywhere you want them to. This allows for regular pressure on any opposition quarterback, forcing opposing players into mistakes.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</h3>



<p>Another option for any player who wants their defensive setup to be highly versatile is the New England Patriots defensive playbook, which includes 3-4, 4-3, and 4-4 formations. If you’re new to Madden 26, it’s another solid option to get you started while you get a feel for the game.</p>



<p>There’s also decent Nickel and Dime options, the latter being some of the best formations in the game. Essentially, the Patriots playbook fits into pretty much every category you’d want it to, ticking off all the boxes.</p>



<h3 id="h-kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</h3>



<p>The strong 4-2-5 formation choices in the Kansas City Chiefs defensive playbook is great for defending against the passing game and, surprisingly, there’s still an abundance of Blitz options to put pressure on the opposing quarterback and halting the running game.</p>



<p>You’ll need to call upon your cornerbacks for a lot of these Blitzes, however, but with an abundance of deep coverage, it shouldn’t leave you too exposed. Once you get used to things, it can be a really effective playbook option.</p>



<h3 id="h-detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</h3>



<p>The 3-3 formation is a fan-favorite in the Madden series and the Detroit Lions rely heavily on this setup in their defensive playbook. You’ll have more than enough options to call upon and, while it might not stand out at first glance, I highly recommend trying it out.</p>



<p>Other options include 4-3 and 3-4 formations, as well as Nickel and Dime, but, in truth, it’s fairly limited in that capacity. If the 3-3 is your calling though, look no further.</p>



<p>What has been your go-to defensive playbook in Madden 26 so far? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p> Six weeks on from the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">Diablo 4's ninth season, Sins of the Horadrim</a>, Blizzard has finally patched up some lingering bugs introduced with the season's new Horadric Strongroom micro-dungeons. Most importantly, players shouldn't have any further problems collecting Horadric Tomes when clearing Strongrooms.</p><p>The Horadric Tome bug has been reported by players for weeks across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1m16y3k/horadric_tome_not_dropping_at_all/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Blizzard's <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/horadric-tomes-not-dropping/227696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">help forums</a>, and the Diablo IV Discord server, and has finally been patched this week. The bug saw players going without a Horadric Tome drop even after grinding Strongrooms, while playing with others who were having no issues finding them.</p>

<p>The first patch following Season 9's release fixed a bug causing duplicate Horadric Tomes to drop on occasion, but the bug causing tomes not to drop at all has persisted until now. Players managed to find their own workarounds for the bug involving swapping between different characters, but no doubt will be glad for an official fix.</p><p>The small patch also fixes up some other issues introduced with Horadric Strongrooms, including a bug with Escalating Nightmares not escalating properly where Strongrooms are involved. The patch is live now for all platforms. Check out the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215995/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list</a> of bug fixes below:</p><h2>2.3.3 Build #67827 (All Platforms)</h2><h2>Bug Fixes</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Horadric Tomes sometimes did not drop when expected.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Escalating Nightmares where the Vile Hive dungeon didn't properly escalate if the Agony boss was defeated in a Horadric Strongroom.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some quests would randomly stop being tracked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Druid’s Wolves' attacks did not always get increased damage from Aspect of the Alpha or the Lust for Carnage Paragon Node while the Unique item Storm's Companion was equipped.</li></ul>

                <p>Aside from the odd pizza and energy drinks, food is a rarity in the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding</a>. So what's a weary porter supposed to do when they need a quick bite to eat? Grab a cryptobiote and chow down, that's what. If you've ever been morbidly fascinated with these wriggly--and disturbingly fleshy organisms--the good news is that you can make some for yourself, thanks to Sony posting a recipe for them online. Even better, these are vegetarian-friendly, so you won't be biting into any post-apocalyptic meat here.</p><p>The recipe looks simple enough, and it allows for you to craft several colorful variants of Cryptobiotes. All you need are a few ingredients like water, glutinous rice flour, and some white bean paste, and you can add some flavor with coffee powder and chili peppers to add some color to the end product. This will give you globs of food that you can roll into the correct shape, and with some fried hiyamugi noodles and chocolate sprinkles as a finishing touch, the end result should be something that Fragile would approve of.</p><p>Remember, <a href="https://youtu.be/9wGpvPkR-lQ" rel="nofollow ">a Cryptobiote a day keeps the Timefall away</a>.</p><p>If you've been looking to check out Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-august-2025-include-this-day-one-release/2900-6875/" data-ref-id="2900-6875">you can grab a five-hour trial for the game</a> if you're subscribed to the Deluxe tier of PlayStation Plus. This will allow you to check out a substantial portion of the game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-gameplay-is-too-good-for-me-to-waste-my-time-watching-its-bad-cutscenes/1100-6532896/">and even more if you decide to skip through cutscenes</a>. Since it launched earlier this year, Death Stranding 2 has emerged as one of those games that most players have stuck with, as game director Hideo Kojima revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/80-of-death-stranding-2-players-who-finished-it-kept-playing-after-the-credits/1100-6533497/">almost 80% of the players who finished it kept playing</a>.</p>

<p>Jackbox Games has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/jackbox_party_pack_11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a>, scheduled to launch on the Switch later this year.</p>
<p>It's looking pretty ridiculous, which is exactly what we've come to expect from the Jackbox franchise, so if you're looking to play a few fun party with family or friends on Christmas Day or Boxing Day (or really any day), then you might want to check this one out.</p>
<p>The minigame highlight for us has to be <strong>Hear Say</strong>, which essentially has you recording sound effects via your phone which are then played in short clips for the other players. It looks (or rather sounds) pretty hilarious.</p>
<p>The full selection of minigames included are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><u><em>- Legends of Trivia</em></u>:</strong> Work with your party to fight fantasy monsters in this cooperative trivia battle<strong><br>
- <u><em>Suspectives</em></u>:</strong> Investigate a crime and defend your innocence in this social deduction game where every player is on trial<strong><br>
- <u><em>Doominate</em></u>:</strong> Wreck wholesome ideas in this hilarious, head-to-head joke‑writing game<strong><br>
- <u><em>Hear Say</em></u>:</strong> Record custom sound effects and watch them come to life in this sound‑based party game<strong><br>
- <u><em>Cookie Haus</em></u>:</strong> Sketch strange desserts based on bizarre prompts in this cozy drawing game</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be sure to let you know the final release date for Jackbox Party Pack 11 as soon as we hear (say) more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 port of Tekken 8 is not off the table, but it is also far from certain at this point. The news comes directly from Game Director Katsuhiro Harada, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to Eurogamer</a> during the recent Evo event:</p>



<p><em>It's an interesting option, and not totally off the table. But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware. From a business standpoint, the Switch 2 is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are no… (laughs) There is nothing to announce.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly a surprising statement from Harada. After all, this is not a complex open world, but a fighting game powered by Unreal Engine 5, which fully supports the latest Nintendo console. Far more taxing titles, like Cyberpunk 2077 for example, have been successfully ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. Perhaps the real reason is that Bandai Namco does not see enough of an audience on the console to justify the port expenses, although fellow Japanese CAPCOM begs to differ, having released Street Fighter 6 on the Switch 2 when it launched on June 5. The port has been well received so far, too.</p>



<p>Anyway, Tekken 8 continues to be supported. At Evo 2025, Bandai Namco announced that a new DLC character, Armor King, will be released on October 13 for Season 2 Character Pass owners and on October 16 for all users. Additionally, a new fighter named Miary Zo from Madagascar will be released as DLC this winter, along with a new stage called Baobab Horizon.</p>

              <p><em>Superman</em> is available to stream from tomorrow, August 15, via NBC’s astonishingly expensive <em>Fandango At Home</em> service. And to accompany its arrival, a five-minute cartoon has been released on YouTube that features the movie’s stand-out character, superdog Krypto. It’s apparently to be the first of a few cartoons, with more due to appear next year. You can watch the whole thing below.</p> <p>One of my favorite things about James Gunn’s very enjoyable Superman flick was that Krypto is never redeemed. Sure, he happens to help out in some vital moments, but it’s never through altruism or some internal sense of heroic duty–it’s cos he gets to bite someone. It must have been so tempting to include a schmaltzy scene in which Krypto is forced to choose between enjoying biting someone’s ankles or putting his own interests aside to save a key character, showing us that there’s some good in his little doggy heart. It’s so wonderful that it never happens. All his helpful moments are self-interested, and that’s a joy.</p> <p>That’s not the case in this astonishingly bad cartoon. Yeah, sorry, I lured you in with a non-committal tone, but I’m woefully unimpressed with what’s been put out here. It begins correctly, with Krypto eye-zapping a flea, and then using his super-powers to terrorize an innocent pigeon, but then completely loses its way by the end as the doggo is saving a school bus out of obligation. Boooooooooo.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Krypto Saves the Day! - Short Film" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPm9ezfa6Qo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>It doesn’t help that the entire short is derivative of Hanna-Barbera’s&nbsp;<em>Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</em>, (which I have Mandela Effect-levels of remembering being called <em>Stop The Pigeon</em>), yet doesn’t have the basic courtesy to even nod to this. You don’t make a cartoon about a dog trying to catch a pigeon and not tip a hat–that’s revolting.</p> <p>But unlike&nbsp;<em>Dastardly and Muttley</em>, there’s absolutely nothing inventive or ingenious here–just a bunch of clumsy events that repeatedly put a school bus in peril, until its crappy conclusion. And yes, sure, I’m making a big, silly fuss about a five-minute free cartoon used as a commercial, but also, it sucks that it’s hung around the neck of such a lovely movie.</p> <p>As a Brit, I don’t have access to your Fandango At Home service, but oh&nbsp;<em>boy</em>, those are some prices! You can <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/Superman-2025-/4349896">pre-order access to&nbsp;<em>Superman</em></a> ahead of tomorrow for $30! I’m sure you’re used to these fees, and I imagine they’re meant to be <span>contemporaneous prices</span> with a couple of people going to the theater, given its still showing. Given prices on other movies on the service, it looks like it’ll be $20 just to rent–imagine Blockbuster trying that shit! Good lord. I get resentful when Amazon Prime tries to charge me £3 to “rent” a film, and then sets time limits on how long I have to finish it!</p> <p>Anyway, I bet you weren’t expecting this level of complaining in a post about a free cartoon! But then, they should have made it good. In the meantime, here’s a perfect palate cleanser.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stop the Pigeon Intro Opening" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj6-LG5VpGk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>DLSS and DLAA are sophisticated graphical and performance-related techniques. They’re crucial for games like Battlefield 6 and its Open Beta. If you’re having problems with DLSS and DLAA not working, this guide has all the answers on why this is.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Open Beta</a> is up and running. You can already tell there’s a greater strain being placed on the beta compared to week one. The social media clips and the hype have got everyone worked up and excited to play.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Week 2 has been hit by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-matchmaking-update-01-arrives-to-fix-playlist-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking and playlist problems</a>, and there’s also DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling<br>) and DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) nuisances.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-dlss-amp-dlaa-working-in-battlefield-6-open-beta">Why Isn’t DLSS &amp; DLAA Working in Battlefield 6 Open Beta?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not as crisp and clear as it could be. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Both DLSS and DLAA are currently disabled in the Battlefield 6 Open beta due to an “issue” being investigated by the BF6 team.</strong></p>



<p>This is a very vague explanation, I know. But this is all the Battlefield Comms <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a> has disclosed for now. This was its first statement on the technical fault:</p>



<p>“The team is aware of reports regarding DLSS / DLAA being unavailable in the Open Beta. We’ll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience!”</p>



<p>Thankfully, we’ve had further updates since then with better news.</p>



<div><article><p><span>The team is aware of reports regarding DLSS / DLAA being unavailable in the Open Beta. We’ll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience!</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-when-will-dlss-amp-dlaa-be-fixed-in-battlefield-6">When Will DLSS &amp; DLAA be Fixed in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 team believes the DLSS and DLAA issues will be resolved by the end of August 14.</strong></p>



<p>Update 01 on the DLSS and DLAA indicates the root cause of the problem has been found. The team is working on it as I write this—alongside a myriad of other headaches—and has given a timeframe.</p>



<p>“The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly.”</p>



<p>As always, this doesn’t mean this <em>will </em>be the case, and there could be unforeseen delays. For now, you’ll have to endure slightly more uneven performance and sub-optimized explosions and gunfire for now. The Battlefield Comms is being very active and vocal on the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, so we do anticipate updates through the beta weekend.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates!</p>



<div><article><p><span>DLSS / DLAA Issue Update 01 —

The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta.

We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly.</span></p></article></div>

            <p>Stay in cover. It's coming. THERE. You see it? A tumbleweed, the deadliest of creatures to roam the desert. Stay quiet, it might roll up on us! Well, at least we'll stand some chance of survival, thanks to a patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>'s devs have just put out in response to the Mesa update being deemed to damn hard.</p>
<p>If you missed this update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peaks-mesa-update-lets-you-shimmy-your-sandy-butt-up-some-sandy-buttes-adds-tornados-and-dynamite">emerging atop the release summit the other day</a>, it adds in the cannibalistic co-op climber's first new biome, offering a different challenge to the alpine cliffs folks have been scaling since the game burst onto the scene. Key to surviving this desert is not to succumb to the heat, get blown up by dynamite, or fail in your attempt to recreate Indy's boulder scene with some mobile shrubbery.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As it's turned out, though, not getting deathed by those threats is providing even harder than expected. "We’re hearing you loud and clear: the Mesa is really hard," co-publishers Aggro Crab and Landfall declare in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/537736322372077260">the notes</a> of the game's latest patch. "Part of me say...<em>good</em> suffer. But it does seem like it’s a bit unfair sometimes, so this patch is to adjust balance and fix bugs that are causing that!"</p>
<p>This brings us to the tumbling weeds. These terrifying bundles of brush now deal thorn damage instead of causing injuries, while their ability to knock you flying has been "made more consistent", and now scales based on the size of the particular tumbleweed. I'm outraged on the part of the plucky little tumbleweeds everywhere who'd been merrily punching above their weight, only to have their power sapped at the whim of Big Weedkiller.</p><p>At least they're not alone. Dynamite now spawns in luggage "slightly less often", and has been robbed of its ability to fatally blow you up through walls. Scorpions now have to be able to see you to become aggroed, have had their movement slowed a little, and "now deal less poison damage depending on how close you already are to passing out". Three more seconds of protection from fall damage has also been added to the scout cannon, and the weight of a mysteriously unnamed  <em>thing</em> has had its weight reduced, mysteriously.</p>
<p>To be fair, developers Team Peak have also helped the tumbleweeds by fixing an issue that'd stopped them from spawning. They've also fixed some problems with the kiln, in addition to disabling the rising lava in it, until they can work out how to make the heat growth sync up across every player in a party's game.</p>
<p>Right. I think the weed's tumbled on. We're clear to move out. Ahh, what's next to cl-wait, is that? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98gooner%E2%80%99-reputation-has-been-addressed-by-its-game-director.1269891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the beginning, Marvel Rivals started out as a budding hero shooter. A few weeks in, and it had amassed an audience of several hundred thousand players and counting. It’s established as one of the best free-to-play games, but recent skins that leave little to the imagination have raised eyebrows.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> launched with a star-studded roster with fabulous unlockable skins. It is a free-to-play game after all, so paid cosmetics were always going to be a thing. We’ve seen an increased influx of more scantily-clad costumes and somewhat exposed heroes, shall we say, in recent skins—leading to the ‘Gooner’ accusations.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-a-gooner-game">Is Marvel Rivals a ‘Gooner’ Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>C’mon, you’ve probably bought at least one of them. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-summer-party-swimsuit-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Summer Party Swimsuit Event</a> and its array of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-costumes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Swimsuit Costumes</a> have contributed greatly to Marvel Rivals’ ‘Gooner’ label.</p>



<p>Game director Guangyun ‘Guangguang’ Chen recently spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivalsAssembled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rivals Assembled</a>. In a special interview talking about all things Marvel Rivals—including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EOMM</a>—Guangguang was asked: “How do you guys respond to people calling Marvel Rivals a gooner game?”</p>



<p>Guangguang barely flinched before replying: “Because our design is inspired by classic comic themes, including some very outstanding skins, like Mantis and also Psylocke’s Vengeance, these all come from classic comic designs, and we create some more fashionable designs based on them to gain players’ appreciation. I think this also reflects the broad recognition from our players.”</p>



<p>“As mentioned earlier, with the Squirrel Girl and the Krakoa Resort skin, these are actually designs based on real-world themes and the season’s storyline. For designs like these, we try our best to integrate the storylines from the season, including elements from Krakoa, and blend popular elements from real life. We create new designs based on that, and I’m very grateful these designs have been well received by the majority of players.”</p>

<p>Brace Yourself Games is continuing its stellar lineup of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> crossover DLC with a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/everhood">Everhood</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>The succinctly named 'Everhood Music Pack' adds four new tracks to the falling notes rhythm game, all of which will be available to purchase separately or as a bundle. The DLC is now live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/57784/Rift__Everhood_Music_Pack/">Steam</a>, and the developers have announced that it will be falling onto Switch "at a later date" — so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Here are the four tracks from the RPG mash-up series that you'll find in this new wave of crossover bonus content:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Final Battle" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Feisty Flowers" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Revenge" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Why Oh You Are LOVE" by Dancefloor is Lava</li>
</ul>
<p>To see in the new releases in style, Brace Yourself Games is also adding a <em>free</em> Rhythm Rift, 'Powers of Destruction' by Cazok, for good measure.</p>
<p>This crossover DLC follows similar collaborations with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pizza_tower">Pizza Tower</a> and Hatsune Miku, and it looks like there's even more to come — which is exciting, because the base game is really rather good.

            <p>The dawn of the second <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta weekend is here. Before it got underway, EA made a few tweaks based on feedback from last week's bout of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>ing about, with the headliners being some playlist changes and the introduction of custom match searching.</p>
<p>It's no massive reinventing of the big battlewheel, but hopefully should make a positive impact on the time folks have in this bit of the beta, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">sees the Empire State map debut</a> alongside week one's offerings. Rush and squad deathmatch modes are also joining the fray.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With the great entry bell for this second beta weekend having just tolled at 9AM BST on August 14th, EA snuck out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options">a post last night</a> revealing these "learnings and changes." The playlist rejigs are, I suspect, the bit you'll care most about, with the devs aiming to deliver "more variety and choice" by having more playlists rotate between different modes.</p>
<p>The example given is the All-Out Warfare playlist, which includes Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush modes for this second weekend. "Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time," EA explained. There's a full rundown of which modes you can expect in playlists at different times across the four days of the beta weekend in that post, so peruse at your leisure.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Your  participation in Battlefield 6's first Open Beta weekend across PC,  Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X|S made it a truly unforgettable  experience for the team. We're thrilled by your feedback, and are  focusing on making the October 10th launch even better.</p><p>Looking  back…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955691976130453569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The custom search feature, meanwhile, lets you pick your desired map and mode combos before you start matchmaking, with the game then endeavouring to stick you in a session that mirrors your choices. That's provided such a gun-filled Goldilocks zone is currently out there, and has a free spot. EA also insist that it's "not a server browser," thank you very much. It'll be on offer for open weapon mode playlists during the beta.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that the training grounds, an initiation mode, and a run-through of of how Rush matches work will be on offer for newbies this weekend, so no worries if this is your first chance to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-early-access">jump into the Battlefield beta</a>.</p>
<p>Time will tell whether the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">entry queues</a> will be a bit less huge at the outset, or that the other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-beta-been-treating-you-to-infinite-loading-screens-ea-are-on-the-case">initial teething issues</a> were all whacked on the head during that first weekend. In any case, don't forget to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">enable secure boot</a> if necessary.

            <title><![CDATA[Is Black Myth: Wukong Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a long wait, Black Myth: Wukong is finally set to release on Microsoft platforms, so you may now be wondering whether the title will be available on Xbox Game Pass. We’ve got the answer.</p>



<p>Releasing August 20th on Xbox Series X|S, Black Myth: Wukong was one of the stand-out games of 2024, making huge waves after launching on PlayStation 5, and was one of the contenders for the Game of the Year title.</p>



<p>12 months after an initial release, Black Myth: Wukong is poised to make its debut on Xbox, and we’ve got the details on whether that includes a Game Pass inclusion.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-myth-wukong-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a long wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Black Myth: Wukong will not be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on August 20th.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/black-myth-wukong/9NWQ1Q1FR0C9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is not an Xbox first-party title, and there has not been any announcement on the game coming to the service. As such, this confirms it won’t be included.</p>



<p>Although Xbox has not announced the second wave of August titles coming to the subscription service, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-for-august-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous announcement</a> covering up until the 14th, Black Myth: Wukong will not be one of the titles included. If it was, it would have been a huge surprise and would have been announced well in advance.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Black Myth: Wukong Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Black Myth: Wukong will ever be added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog in the future, although nothing can be ruled out entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science has close ties with Sony, releasing the title exclusively on PlayStation in August last year, and, while that timed-exclusive period has come to an end, it doesn’t mean the floodgates will open for an addition to the service.</p>



<p>Truthfully, if Black Myth: Wukong were to become available on any subscription service, it would probably be Sony’s PS Plus service. Even then, such an addition is unlikely to happen for a while, given the popularity of the title, so there’s not really any reason for Game Science to secure a deal.</p>

			<p>You have to love indie games. Ideas that probably wouldn’t raise the pulse of the shareholders at Ubisoft or Activision are given the chance to grow and develop, bringing surprises, joy and a range of emotions that their AAA brethren can only hope to emulate. Is This Seat Taken? is the perfect example of this, a cosy puzzler that’s fundamentally about helping people to enjoy where they’re sitting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? – Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQLzRj1E6Ao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you arrive in each city, beginning in beautiful Bareclona, you’re given a series of stages where the characters have to be appeased. They’re generally going on a journey, so you have to work on the seating arrangements for the trip, dealing with people who can’t face backwards, have forgotten to wash that day, or desperately want to chat to the person next to them.</p>


<p>The problems arise when other people dislike smells, don’t want to talk, or just want to be on their own, forcing you to think long and hard about where they’re going to sit. As you progress, the demands get greater, the dislikes become more wide ranging, and more and more people want to get on the bus. You’ll find yourself shifting people all over the place, like a game of musical chairs for toddlers who may or may not sit in the nearest chair, for reasons known only to them.</p>


<p>It’s not just buses, but cars, cinemas, gigs, diners and various other places where sitting down is a key part of the experience. Fundamentally, the action, such as it is, is the same for each stage, but the changing setups help to keep things interesting, with different needs such as food and drink, friends, belongings and music coming to the fore based on the context.</p>
<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a cosy little view into the human mind. Let’s face it, we’re all a fussy bag of desires and dislikes, and most of the time, we don’t share those with the people we’re put into close proximity with. There’s a key sense of discomfort when you place someone incorrectly, and their face makes sure you know it – I literally couldn’t bring myself to complete a level without achieving a 100% rating. That’s probably made stronger by years working in customer service, but it’s funny to find it so affecting when you’re placing a batch of cartoon shapes into a bus.</p>

<p>Is This Seat Taken? has a simple but lovely art style. Each person is represented by a different shape, and little details such as hats, shoes and earrings to personalise them. The notes you’re given on their needs are also chunky little handwritten lists, with a tickbox to show you’ve got each element right. It’s all enhanced by the chill musical ditties playing in the background, which sit just the right side of elevator music. They don’t distract, instead massaging your clever little brain as you take care of all these needy little shapes.</p>
<p>There’s a few mild foibles to Is This Seat Taken? which take you slightly out of the fiction, not least the food and drink areas where you can sit random people together who’ll dive into the same box of fries or share a cup of coffee. Once you’ve got over that slightly strange fact – made weirder by the notion that people are otherwise <em>so</em> demanding in the game – you can just settle into the calm and enjoyable puzzling. It’s overall not the toughest of games, but everything is so well done that you likely won’t notice.</p>

		<p>Pearl Abyss has confirmed that Crimson Desert will not be released in late 2025, with a new release now expected in early 2026. The game was f<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/11/crimson-desert-pearl-abyss-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-2021-open-world-fantasy/">irst revealed back in 2020</a> with an initial release year of 2021, before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/02/crimson-desert-delayed-new-release-date-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox/">getting delayed in August 2021</a>. The news came from an earnings call (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026">Gematsu</a>). It was less than a year ago when Pearl Abyss released the below trailer giving the late 2025 release window.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the earnings call, Pearl Abyss said, <em>“Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voice-overs, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market. The launch of Crimson Desert, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</em></p>
<p><em>The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week. We are grateful for your continued interest in our company, and we will do our utmost to deliver an even better experience going forward.”</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-thats-full-of-surprises/">Battling four bosses in Crimson Desert reveals a game that’s full of surprises</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of Crimson Desert, Stefan said, <em>“We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year”</em></p>

<p>The official Battlefield Communications page has acknowledged an issue concerning matchmaking when choosing playlist options in Battlefield 6. The ‘Update 01’ has been deployed in a bid to rectify this, and there’s more details on future measures in the works.</p>



<p>Was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Weekend 2</a> ever going to go smoothly without a single problem? Probably not. That’s a testament to the work that Battlefield Studios has put into the game’s testing and marketing. Thousands—potentially millions—of players are desperately trying to log in for the second-week beta. Understandably, there’s a big issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-update-01-drops">Battlefield 6 Update 01 Drops</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Revive matchmaking, please. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battlefield Comms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page has been active since the Weekend 2 beta started. It’s trying to keep players up to speed with bugs and potential hiccups you might encounter.</p>



<p>Matchmaking is proving to be one of the biggest walls we want to blow a hole through, though.</p>



<p>Here’s what Update 01 brings: “If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update. EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair. The team continues to assess this.”</p>



<p>If the problem is happening to you, I recommend trying these methods. The final sentence shows that this is a <em>high priority</em> for the team, and more updates are likely in the works.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-offensive-playbooks-madden-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-best-offensive-playbooks-in-madden-26.1269861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is here with a fresh slew of content to dig your teeth into, though you won’t be able to get anywhere without the best offensive playbooks. Fortunately for you, that’s where we come in.</p>



<p>Whether your mode of choice is Franchise Mode or Ultimate Team, Superstar Mode or going head-to-head against your friends online, a strong offensive playbook in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> is crucial. Without one, you’ll struggle to find any momentum.</p>



<p>Even if you have the best players in the world, a decent playbook is pivotal to unlocking their full potential. To make things easier for you, we’ve picked out our six favorite offensive playbooks.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-offensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Offensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</h3>



<p>Arguably the best option in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a> for those who want a versatile offence, able to call upon both passing and running plays, the Chicago Bears playbook is incredibly strong. In fact, the only downside is that there are no Pistol plays to call upon, but there’s enough to keep you busy.</p>



<p>If you have a decent slew of receivers and running backs in your team, and you don’t want to rely heavily on one player, the Bears playbook is the perfect choice. With it at your disposal, it will be difficult for any opponent to predict your next move.</p>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>Another option for those who want to rely on short passes, the Green Bay Packers playbook is exceptionally strong. Overall, the Packers have one of the most versatile playbooks in Madden 26, with a wide range of formations to call upon.</p>



<p>Top of the list are the Bunch formation plays, a go-to for many players in the community, and they are the perfect tool in your arsenal for breaking down a tough defence. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</h3>



<p>The New Orleans Saints playbook is the best choice for those who want to rely on short passes, as well as having several options for a mobile quarterback. While it might not be the playbook that dominates highlight reels, it’s effective in getting you moving and is probably the best choice to start with.</p>



<p>Well-balanced with a variety of formations, including Wildcat, there are some deeper plays you can call upon to mix things up. However, the strength is certainly in quick passes and pitches. </p>



<h3 id="h-philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</h3>



<p>The Eagles have been one of the strongest teams in the NFL for years, so it’s hardly surprising that they boast one of the strongest and most versatile playbooks in Madden 26. To unlock the full potential of the playbook, however, you’ll need a strong Tight End in your ranks.</p>



<p>Another strength is the variety of ways you can keep your opponent on their toes, with an array of trick plays to call upon. Even against the toughest defences, the playbook is loaded with options to keep you ahead and leave your opponent on the backfoot.</p>



<h3 id="h-san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</h3>



<p>If you want to lean heavily on a talented running back, the San Francisco 49ers playbook is the one for you. Ideally used when facing a zone defense, this playbook is perfect for finding a receiver in wide open space, or hammering through the defensive line with your running back.</p>



<p>The downside, of course, is the playbook requires a top-class running back, and, without it, you’ll struggle to find momentum. If you’re in Franchise Mode and have that at your disposal, or have packed a top-class running back in Ultimate Team, I highly suggest taking a looking at this option.</p>



<h3 id="h-los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</h3>



<p>Another option for anyone wanting a run-focused offense is the Los Angeles Chargers playbook, with boasts a wide array of Singleback plays. There are also some rather unique plays to call upon to leave your opponents in a spin, though you’ll require decent depth with your running options.</p>



<p>The benefit over the 49ers playbook is a decent chunk of Shotgun plays to call upon, bringing your receivers into the game more and providing greater options when calling plays. </p>



<p>Which playbook has been your go-to in Madden 26 so far? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>!</p>

Often, individuals working for external support teams, like localization or quality assurance, will be omitted. Sometimes, studios will leave out the names of people who departed ahead of launch. Improper crediting doesn't always mean a person can't list a project on their resume, but it's—at best—unfair to the developers who worked on the game and aren't credited and, at worst, actively hampering careers.

Their first game credit for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metal Gear Solid 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a 'special thanks' at the end of the roll call—something that didn't accurately represent the scope of their contributions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When they began specifically asking for credits, they were told the studio that had solicited their services didn't include external developers in their credits.

Sega of America's contract, for instance, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/sega-workers-reach-landmark-collective-bargaining-agreement">requires the company to credit all workers that contribute to its games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—including "early QA testers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">ZeniMax Workers United has two pages dedicated to crediting practices in its signed contract agreement. It sets out the following attribution guidelines:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">a) The Employer will credit all bargaining unit employees who are assigned (or ancillary) to the title and are employed 90 calendar days before a project’s full public release date. Anyone not employed 90 days minimum before the projected full release date will appear in “Special Thanks”, “Additional Credits” or some other equitable designation.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">b) Bargaining unit employees must work on the title for at least 30 calendar days before the credit lock date. Contributors below this threshold will appear in “Special Thanks”, “Additional Credits” or some other equitable designation.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">c) Bargaining unit employees will be credited by their lived name (first and last) and their role or nature of work at the time credits are created. In the event a bargaining unit employee updates their lived name with Human Resources, the Employer shall then update the publicly accessible list of credits, if available. Changes or updates to in-game credits will be at Management’s discretion.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">d) Credits shall be updated with credit given to those who meet these criteria for additional major releases related to the game (large updates, DLC, etc).</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The contract also has a section that lays out the visibility of credits, too. The credits have to be made available to anyone who plays the game, regardless of whether or not they've completed it. There's even a process that outlines how the company must be informed if mistakes are made, and if they want to change how their name appears. (The contract doesn't have any process—aside from being "at the employer’s discretion"—on how people who no longer work there can have theirs changed).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unions, then, have both collective worker power and legal strength to push back on a multitude of issues, including crediting problems. The union has resources that an individual may not, meaning workers don't simply have to trust an internal policy. They can also garner widespread cross-industry support. UVW-CWA, unlike the unions under Sega of America and ZeniMax, is a direct-join union. That means any game worker can join its ranks, regardless of where they work or whether they’re a freelance or contract worker.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">UVW-CWA currently has more than 500 members across the industry in North America and Canada. It works differently in that there isn't a contract between the union and specific companies. Instead, its power comes from the collective voice of members.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The freelancing group under UVW-CWA is looking to create contract standards to help individual workers negotiate crediting terms into their contracts with companies. Webster said the union hasn't nailed down exact language just yet, but explained it could be useful, for instance, to ensure anybody who worked on a game for more than 30 days must be included in the credits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Game developers and publishers could work with unions in drafting a clause in the contract stating that all external collaborators are credited no matter how big or small that collaboration is," Morales added. Crucially, those clauses could be used to hold companies accountable if people are not properly credited. Morales said organizations like ATRAE are working to help people receive proper credits. That includes helping developers contact studios to make them aware of crediting issues in the hopes of delivering a fix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios don't always comply, but with contracts in hand—or a mass of worker support—that could change.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/video-games-have-a-serious-crediting-problem-but-unions-can-help]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA and Dice have detailed what's changing in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> Beta in its second week, which kicks off today and runs until 17th August.</p>
<p>Changes are being made to the All-Out Warfare playlist and there is now more control over map and mode selection thanks to custom search. New players will still be able to access training and general gameplay overviews for classes, Breakthrough, and Conquest.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Playlists Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>During Week 2, we're delivering more variety and choice for how you’d like to play with more playlists rotating between multiple different game modes. As an example, the All-Out Warfare playlist will include both Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. The in-game descriptions for each mode will tell you which modes are included in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Search Options</strong></p>
<p>Based on your previous feedback and to give you more control over map and mode selection, we're introducing a new feature called Custom Search.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. Note that this is not a Server Browser (which is not being tested this week).</p>
<p>During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>Weekend 2 Playlists Overview</strong></p>
<p>Here is an overview of what the Open Beta Weekend 2 playlists will look like:</p>
<p><strong>Day 1, Thursday 14th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Rush</li>
<li>Attack &amp; Defend (Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 2, Friday 15th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Squad Deathmatch</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch)</li>
<li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 3-4, Saturday 16th - Sunday 17th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch).</li>
<li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
<li>Rotating through playlists daily is specific for the Open Beta while we're still able to test and gather feedback, and is not planned for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other details to note:</strong></p>
<p>Training Grounds will continue to offer the Firing Range and gameplay introductions for classes, Breakthrough, and Conquest.</p>
<p>Players at career rank 15 and below can access Initiation Mode, which includes AI Soldiers. This initiation experience is tailored for new players and will shift from Breakthrough to Conquest. Separately, there will be a non-playable introduction to Rush as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback and enthusiasm over this weekend. We look forward to seeing how these playlist options work in the matchmaking and the flexibility they offer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 6 releases on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles on 10th October.</p>

            <p>Around a week ago, <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804">146,000 people mourned the death of a horse they'd never met</a>. This might be the best single thing that has ever happened in videogames, although I don't imagine the horse would give a shit. Grass Wonder was a famous Japanese racehorse, but it's likely the majority  of those that mourned his death online are only fans of Japanese horse racing by proxy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/champion-grass-wonder-the-grandsire-of-maurice-dies-at-30">Here is an article about Grass Wonder's death</a> that does not mention <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224770/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> once. I find this profound and comforting, in the sense that it feels miraculous that such intertwined cultural spheres can still exist in their own siloes. There are people who knew Grass Wonder well, yet would look at you playing the anime horse girl game in wordless confusion, save a muttered directive that you seek the love and light of a forgiving god.</p>
<p>I'm not going to eulogise Grass Wonder because I do not care about Grass Wonder any more than I care about any other horse, and don't especially feel like pretending I do just for the sake of a bit. I think all horses are pretty good but I cannot eulogise them all. But Grass Wonder <em>is </em>special is the sense that Grass Wonder is the horse I'm currently thinking about. Grass Wonder is, as far as I'm concerned, the most famous horse in the world right now. He tramples with disdain over the frail, fallen forms of lesser attention economy aspirants, and from beyond the grave no less.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Again, we can tell from that social post linked above that Pretty Derby has inspired at least 146,000 people that I imagine would not have otherwise known about the existence, never mind death, of Grass Wonder, to spend at least some time this month thinking about his passing. I have not played <a href="https://umamusume.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Wonder">the horse girl game</a>. Perhaps it has the power to repair my relationship with my own soul, although I'm sceptical. But today, at least, it has conjured for me a reminder that fate has both a sense of humour and a penchant for Gacha mechanics. If the universe is, indeed, a machine for producing ever more potent instances of novelty, it did a fine job with the cultural impact of this racehorse's fatal organ failure.</p><p>According to the article linked above, Grass Wonder "sired 736 winners from 1327 foals". If someone in the comments could enlighten me to whether this is a misprint I would be grateful. Grass Wonder has been breeding for 25 years. If we assume the above to be true, that's about 53 kids a year, or one a week. Goliath-felling levels of mythical dick slinging, that. A real legacy, although Grass Wonder's impact on me will remain the still very notable achievement of making me think about horse dick while writing about videogames. This basically never happens. Oh, maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>, actually. Weird that it happened twice, etc.</p>

		<p>The life immersion sim inZOI will be releasing on PS5 in 2026, Krafton has announced. The aim is to get the game out in the first half of 2026 and it could be the target is to launch it a year after early access launched on PC, which was in March this year. Krafton has confirmed the PS5 version will be optimised for consoles and it will have the same features as the PC version.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Early Access Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwngGWQWSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition to the PS5 announcement, Krafton also announced the free Island Getaway DLC, which will add the new location of Cahaya. Cahaya is a location that is based upon South East Asian locations, and it will add new activities such as snorkelling and swimming. There will be two islands to explore in Island Getaway, including a resort island and a main island. Motorcycles and electric scooters will allow players to travel around all locations in the game, and you will also be able to undertake new roles including farming, mining, fishing, and gem crafting. Random gatherings will also take place around the world of inZOI, and there will be new ways to co-operate with other players too. Krafton has also stated that this update will bring limited controller support, which will be in a testing phase.</p>
<p><em>“Cahaya was shaped by feedback from our players, going all the way back to Early Access launch earlier this year,”</em> said Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim, CEO of inZOI Studio and Director of&nbsp;inZOI.<em> “This DLC reflects a vision we’ve built together with our community. Developing a game in a new genre has been a real challenge, but the support we’ve received means everything to us, and we’re just getting started.”</em></p>

<p>The launch of the Island Getaway DLC will coincide with the Mac launch of inZOI on August 20th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-playable-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be playable for the first time at Gamescom 2025 next week</a>. The hype among fans is increasing on a daily basis, and the latest round of rumors provided <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955489759536771403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> by CAPCOM insider Dusk Golem will fuel them even further. According to Dusk Golem, while the game isn't an open world as originally designed, it still has open levels such as Raccoon City and a vehicle is available to travel around them. CAPCOM has reportedly been working hard to improve the performance in those Resident Evil Requiem levels, which bodes well given the issues seen in Monster Hunter Wilds. Lastly, Dusk Golem said that the combat segments with Leon have been enhanced with some elements borrowed from The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p><em>Right now, officially, they've talked about the ability to switch between first &amp; third person on the fly (and basically designing two different games alongside each other to accomplish this as it required big retooling to work with both), the new lighting/shadow engine, the hair engine from Pragmata. Additionally, we know the stalker uses a new dynamic AI system they've done to behave uniquely and intelligently on the fly. There's a few other innovations, some I know, but also, sure, I don't know all of them. A small handful I don't mind sharing is they've been working hard to achieve having good performance on open-level designed areas like Raccoon City, along with a vehicle to travel around it. The combat with Leon has seen huge innovations, honestly, some The Last of Us Part 2-isms, but also its own innovations.</em></p>



<p><em>There's been an effort to provide more environmental physics systems and interactivity for Grace's segments where she has to work with the environment more, and balance light and darkness. And more I won't say, and sure more I don't know. But they have a lot more to reveal.</em></p>



<p>It should be noted that, at this time, Resident Evil Requiem only has one official protagonist, FBI technical analyst Grace Ashcroft, who is sent to investigate a series of strange deaths at the Raccoon City hotel where her mother died eight years ago. However, CAPCOM has often kept other playable protagonists quiet throughout the series, so it wouldn't be too much of a surprise if the Leon rumor turned out to be true.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>Hey, Agent 47. That's a really nice scarf. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is getting written about a lot these days so I'm seeing quite a few screenshots of buildings being blown up. I'm not sure exactly why, but I seem to have developed a visceral distaste for images of buildings being blown up recently. At times like these, it's nice to look at a nice scarf.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It feels grandiose and a little paranoid to relate those images of bombed-out structures to part of a larger cultural project of desensitisation, although I'm not <em>not </em>struck temporarily mute and reeling and a touch nauseous at the moment we find ourselves in, in which art about love is reframed as pornography, too vile to touch, and in which art that conjures and celebrates reminders of contemporary global suffering fades so routinely into the normal order of things. More than normal. Hot property. Hot like chapped dehydrated lips under a cruel sun. Hot like fire from the sky.</p>
<p>So, as I say, it's nice just to see a lovely scarf. Helps take the mind off things, you know?</p>
<p>I can see that you're enjoying that scarf, too, Agent 47. Don't lose focus, though. You almost missed that security camera!</p>

<p>You have to take out the cameras first, 47. It's just good business, taking out the cameras, right before you do something too vile for words. Oh, right. News. Yes. IO Interactive recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7356956984207630336">hired a new writer on World Of Asssasination</a> in former Edge editor Jen Simpkins, which likely means we'll be getting more substantial updates that I'd previously assumed, lining up with IO's promises that Hitman isn't completely wrapped up as they move on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>. This is a videogame news piece on a videogame website. You can't say it isn't.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sports Interactive and SEGA has released a new teaser for Football Manager 26, the next football manager game that will be released after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-to-focus-on-fm-26/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled earlier this year.</a> This new video gives us a glimpse at some in game footage of the Football Manager 26’s match day experience, including a tease of player walk outs. There is also a focus on the Premier League branding, which has been officially licensed for the new release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | GUESS WHO'S BACK | #FM26" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faFwhGRwLCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This has been a very bumpy journey for Sports Interactive and its long running Football Manager series. The cancellation of Football Manager 25 was the first time a game in the series had ever been cancelled, and the main reason for this was the shift from the old engine to Unity to provide a more up to date gameplay experience. Football Manager 25 was meant to incorporate women’s football, but it was going to cut &nbsp;Sports Interactive also announced some features were set to be removed from FM25, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. It is not yet clear if these modes will be in Football Manager 26.</p>
<p>While there is no release date for Football Manager 26 yet, it would be expected to follow previous games in the series and launch at some point in November, so players can play through the 2025/26 season and beyond. Sports Interactive has stated more information will be coming soon about what to expect in Football Manager 26.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-%E2%80%98fox-hunt%E2%80%99-multiplayer-mode-launches-in-fall-with-no-crossplay.1269816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KONAMI announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox Hunt</a>, the multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, will be available sometime in the Fall season. However, there's also some bad news: the official Japanese account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1955585126286377462%7Ctwgr%5E73386f46dba965f7676b994d8eff39cf2cc05419%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-will-not-support-cross-play-konami-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that there will be no crossplay in Fox Hunt. </p>



<p>This is less than ideal, to say the least, especially for a multiplayer mode that launches after launch. Most players might have already forgotten about it by the time Fox Hunt becomes available. Some fans are already worried that the mode could be 'dead on arrival', although that's way too early to say. </p>



<p>Fox Hunt has been heavily inspired by the fan-favorite Metal Gear Online, as outlined in the mode's official description: </p>



<p><em>A thrilling, hide-and-seek-based, completely original online multiplayer experience. This unique Metal Gear online experience utilizes the central elements of the base game: camouflage and survival.</em></p>



<p><em>It is based on the Sneaking rule from METAL GEAR ONLINE. It utilizes the fundamentals of one of the most popular game rules from METAL GEAR ONLINE, as well as the iconic sneaking gameplay elements of the METAL GEAR series. The latest graphical enhancements amplify the tension of hide-and-seek to a whole new level.</em></p>



<p>Still, this is really just an extra. The main course will be the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, which fans of the series have been waiting for a long time. Developed with the help of Virtuos (which also took care of the Oblivion Remaster) in Unreal Engine 5, MGS: Delta Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to debut in exactly two weeks</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game features a few quality-of-life improvements, such as a modern control scheme (although the original is optionally available, too), but the original's core experience remains intact. We'll soon learn if it stands the test of time.</p>
