<p>If you happen to be scrolling the PlayStation Store of late, you might notice a particularly familiar-looking art style in the shape of developer Wisnu Sudirman's '<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10017289">Anime Village Online</a>'. Contrary to its appearance, this is not an Animal Crossing game. That's right, we have another rip-off on our hands (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/another-suspiciously-animal-crossing-like-game-has-appeared-on-the-playstation-store/">VGC</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5svkinm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Set to be released in 2027 (though we wouldn't bet on it making it that far), Anime Village Online promises to be a "cozy life simulation game where you can create your dream village, decorate your home, and enjoy a peaceful world — all while playing solo or with friends online". It boasts such original features as the chance to "Design and expand your own charming house", "meet NPC villagers", and "Invite friends to visit your village". Is this ringing any bells?</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of those features can be mapped to just about every cosy game we can think of — and not <em>everything</em> is an Animal Crossing rip-off — but there's something about that key art which just looks <em>very</em> ninja-worthy. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YellowFlower69/">YellowFlower69</a> said as they shared the game page to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/">r/playstation</a> Reddit forum, "someone is getting sued".</p>

<p>No screenshots have been added to the PlayStation Store game page just yet, but based on that description and key art, we imagine that they'd probably have more than a little AC flavouring.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that we've seen something distinctly New Horizons-y appear on the PlayStation Store, either. Earlier this year, the similarly titled '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/random-geez-ps5-game-anime-life-sim-sure-looks-familiar">Anime Life Sim</a>' caught our eye with its all-round Animal Crossing vibe. That project ended up being a straight asset flip of the 'CozyLife: Social Sim Game' Unreal Engine template and, unsurprisingly, has since been taken down.</p>
<p>We don't know for sure whether Anime Village Online will meet the same fate (it probably will), but just make sure you aren't fooled by another one of Redd's fakes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Every addition to Nintendo’s online catalog of classic games is a welcome one. Not least because there’s no reason on Earth that the company doesn’t just add them all at once, given they’ll <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-reddit-mod-archbox-million-2000631966">sue you into the sun</a> if you try to play the 30-year-old games by any other means. But this latest update for the SNES collection in what’s now called Nintendo Classics, alongside a&nbsp;<em>Bubsy</em> and a <em>Fatal Fury</em>,&nbsp;features a <em>Mario</em> game that’s never been released outside of Japan before.</p> <p>Let’s do <em>Bubsy In: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</em> first. You have to forgive the double-punning title, because the SNES and Genesis release was extremely well received in 1993. The first of eight <em>Bubsy</em> platform games (with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4bq6P8e5gk">a ninth to come next year</a> from an increasingly desperate Atari), the nothing-like-a-bobcat Bubsy sets out to save…balls of yarn. Not exactly high-peril stakes, but a classic piece of 16-bit platforming with an animation style you just don’t see any more.</p>

 <p>Next up is&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: Special</em>, a 1994 SNES release following its 1993 arcade debut. It was the third game in the <em>Fatal Fury</em> fighting game franchise, and essentially an improved version of 1992’s&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury 2</em>. It added previously CPU-only boss characters to the fighting roster, and rather significantly added combos to the series. It has looped around in the past, with an Xbox Arcade release in 2007, a Wii version in 2009, and then yet again appeared on consoles in 2017. While the Neo Geo version is generally thought to be the best, this is obviously an emulation of the SNES port.</p>

 <p>The final addition is certainly the most intriguing.&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Wario</em> was put out for the Super Famicom in 1993, but then never went on to receive a worldwide release—even though the game was entirely in English. But now the rest of the world can finally discover this peculiar <em>Lemmings</em>-like puzzle-platformer featuring Mario stumbling around levels with objects obscuring his view after Wario wedged them over his head. You play as Wanda, a fairy, who magics the levels’ platforms to keep Mario safe and guide him to Luigi who’ll pull the object off his noggin. And she did all this using the SNES’s mouse peripheral. So yes, with the Switch 2’s mouse-like controllers, that’s achievable once more.</p>  <p>Because these are SNES games, they’re included in the basic, cheaper version of Nintendo’s Switch Online subscription package, rather than the nonsensically named “+ Expansion Pack” higher tier. So, that’s the $20 a year version, unfortunately necessary if you want to play any Switch games online or use the save cloud feature. The Expansion Pack addition bumps it up to $50 a year (so, you know, two months of Game Pass) and adds in GameCube, N64, Genesis and GBA catalogs, as well as “free” DLC for a few Nintendo games.</p>

            <p>As the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> beta draws to a close, almost 99 percent of later matches were cheater free, Activision has claimed.</p>
<p>The online beta began last week and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-is-out-and-is-already-plagued-by-cheaters">initially seemed to be plagued by cheaters</a>, but a few days later Activision claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-cheaters-banned-within-30-minutes-activision-claims">97 percent of cheaters were banned within 30 minutes of playing</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in a message from Team Ricochet, Activision has stated its anti-cheat tool has gone from strength-to-strength over the course of the beta.</p>

<p>On the first day, it said, 97.5 percent of matches were free of cheaters. And by the fifth day, that rose to 98.8 percent of matches being cheater-free.</p>
<p>"The trend is clear: Each day of Beta, #TeamRICOCHET adapted and improved, preventing and stopping cheaters faster - and ensuring more players experience the clean matches they expect," reads a post from the official Call of Duty Updates account.</p>
<p>"This is the result of years of investment, refinement, and collaboration across teams who care deeply about fair play. Our work doesn't stop here."</p>
<p>The Ricochet anti-cheat will continue learning once the full game is released next month.</p>
<p>"Cheaters were expected," Activision wrote in a previous post on the topic. "But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat.</p><p>"Those who did manage to slip through didn't last long. Most never made it into a match. You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta. We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We're watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt.</p>
<p>"And this is just the beginning. When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat's defenses will only grow stronger."</p>

<p>Cheaters have long been an issue in Call of Duty's online multiplayer, with the latest advancements in Ricochet Anti-Cheat being part of Activision's continued efforts to clean up the game. It remains to be seen how cheaters will fare once the game is released, but Activision appears confident in preventing the vast majority of cheaters from reaching a match.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 will release on 14th November across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>However, it has stiff competition from EA's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, out tomorrow. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">that game's anti-cheat methods proved successful during its beta</a> in August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s destruction technology has received praise from all players, and it seems that dropping previous-gen consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, was key in reaching that standard. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have elaborated on the destruction tech used in the game several times ahead of release. The title utilizes tactical destruction, which brings “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-elaborate-on-tactical-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unparalleled levels of freedom</a>” to the game, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by <span>the&nbsp;intimate destruction</span> experience in Bad Company 2. Now, the developers have explained what it takes to achieve this level of destruction in BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-magic-trick-behind-battlefield-6-s-destruction-is-dropping-previous-gen-consoles">The ‘Magic Trick’ Behind Battlefield 6’s Destruction is Dropping Previous-Gen Consoles</h2>



<p><span>During a new interview with Battlefield 6’s technical director, Christian Buhl,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-dev-says-its-destruction-tech-is-so-delicious-for-one-simple-reason-the-only-magic-trick-is-that-were-not-on-the-ps4-or-xbox-one-any-more/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>&nbsp;asked what the secret sauce was behind the game’s destruction system.</span> Buhl revealed that “Maybe the only magic trick is that we’re not on the PS4 or Xbox One anymore.” This enabled developers to work with increased memory and CPU speed, which in turn improved overall performance. As the developers weren’t trying to optimize the “game to run on a PS4, for example.”</p>



<p>However, there was still a lot of work done towards Battlefield 6’s destruction after dropping previous-gen consoles. Buhl spoke about “testing destruction” and the different areas that need to be optimised. The technical director also talked about the Frostbite engine, which was built for Battlefield, and destruction, and “those pieces are core parts of the engine.” The developer concluded, stating,”&nbsp;I don’t think there was any magic bullet. It was just a lot of testing, a lot of iteration, a lot of work.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-and-multiplayer-has-the-same-destruction-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale and multiplayer</a> have the same destruction system. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-players-dont-give-a-damn-about-new-portal-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 12% of BF6 players</a> give a damn about the new Portal mode. What are your thoughts on removing previous-generation consoles like Xbox One and PS4, which could help improve Battlefield 6’s destruction?

<p>Full credit to whoever discovered it</p>

<figure data-uuid="77adc1e2113ac"><a title="Mario galaxy credits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77adc1e2113ac/mario-galaxy-credits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, as we all know, Nintendo does like to hide fun little secrets and easter eggs within its adventures, especially when it comes to stuff like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario Galaxy</a> games.</p>
<p>You know, things like the part of Buoy Base Galaxy that looks like a Poké Ball, or Captain Olimar's S.S. Dolphin floating about in the Space Junk Galaxy. Yes, we love some clever little nods and winks.</p>
<p>However, as it turns out, not all secrets are quite so equally created. As highlighted by the excellent <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mariobrothblog.bsky.social">@MarioBrothBlog</a> (cheers for the heads-up <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/super-mario-galaxy-has-a-horribly-inefficient-secret-the-credits-are-always-loaded-in-the-background-while-you-play-which-has-the-inadvertently-heartwarming-side-effect-of-making-sure-the-platformer-always-remembers-the-nintendo-legends-who-made-it/">GamesRadar</a>), the Super Mario Galaxy games, in their original Wii forms, secretly load the entire staff credits into RAM at all times, even though...well, you only really need that to happen at the start or end, ideally.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890gzwoys&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>As you can see, the original social media post has at least found a nice way to frame this discovery (attributed to <a href="https://x.com/heyimheroic">@HEYimheroic</a>) in that it's a nice way to permanently — and constantly — honour the creators of this bona fide all-timer.</p>
<p>Supper Mario Broth goes on to provide further info through a few follow-up posts: the RAM used up by the credits being programmed in this way is around 1/400th of the entire available memory, which adds up to about one or two in-game objects.</p>
<p>It also turns other that in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> the issue was addressed by having a more efficient approach to loading, although the files <em>do</em> still load at all times regardless.</p>

<p>Given that Nintendo has got itself into a little bit of bother a few times lately with credits, and specifically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/metroid-prime-engineer-let-down-by-exclusion-of-original-credits-in-remaster">removing some of them from the likes of Metroid Prime Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/retro-staff-credits-removed-from-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-forever-entertainment-confirmed-as-devs">from Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, it's nice to see that once upon a time the original creators remained right where they should be.</p>

            <p>You might remember that a little while ago, Bethesda <a href="https://www.vg247.com/elder-scrolls-6-npc-opportunity-charity-auction">announced an auction</a> which'd see the winner given the chance to design a character in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. Bids were donations to the charity Make-A-Wish, and narrowly missing out on top spot was one from the folks behind the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, the series' long-running and very good independent wiki. The good news is that those folks how now met with Bethesda and had the chance to design their NPC, which'll be a memorial to a forum user whose roleplaying has crossed paths with official Elder Scrolls lore.</p>

<p>"We just finished up a meeting with Bethesda where we got to design a character for The Elder Scrolls 6," reads a post from the UESP lot earlier today, October 9th. "Honestly, a lot of us went into the meeting pretty nervous and even reserved, but now we're all extremely excited for what's in store."</p>
<p>I'll confess that despite being a big fan of the Elder Scrollage, I couldn't immediately recall hearing about these lorekeepers being offered the chance to design a character in the series' long-teased next entry. As it turns out, after coming up short of the NPC design auction's $85,300 dollar winning bid, the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks ended up chatting to Bethesda about the reason they'd decided to get involved.</p>

<blockquote>The significance of Loranna's RP to unofficial lore lies in the forum posts of developer Ted Peterson, who used the roleplay as a doodle ground to play with worldbuilding and character ideas. According to Peterson, he would get insider information on what Bethesda was doing for the next game and its worldbuilding, such as King Helseth of Morrowind outlawing slavery or Arch-Mage Hannibal Traven of the Mages Guild existing, and incorporate it into the campaigns. Later on, he would use concepts originated in the roleplay, some of which made it into official lore via A Pocket Guide to the Empire: Third Edition and in-game books present in Oblivion. As a source, Loranna's RP can inform these official materials with greater context. Peterson himself maintains that roleplay is "only partially canon," and that its contents should be treated as a secondary source that only become fully canon or fully non-canon once incorporated into or disproved by primary sources later on.</blockquote>
<p>Despite the outcome of the auction, Bethesda agreed to let the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks design their character provided they could "match the auction amount with a group donation campaign to Make-A-Wish". Doing so took some teaming up with fellow Elder Scrolls lore site <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a> and others, as well as a traffic bump spurred by the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><p>"It's kind of unbelievable that we got this far," the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks wrote in an Instagram post back in May. "This whole thing started on an offhand comment about possibly teaming up, and then grew into this giant group effort. We're looking forward to adding this character to TES VI. We couldn't think of a more appropriate way to honor Loranna's contributions to both the Elder Scrolls community and the lore than a community charity fundraising effort like this while simultaneously making an addition the lore proper.</p>
<p>It's always great to see the odd character in a massive RPG be used for this kind of thing, and I'm glad the folks who've facilitated me being able to instantly check what <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cattle">cows have looked like in every Elder Scrolls game</a> have been able to create an in-game way to remember Loranna.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft reportedly cancelled development on its next Assassin's Creed game last year over political concerns due to its planned post-American Civil War setting.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Game File</a>, the game would have been set in the Reconstruction period that followed the civil war in the 1860s and 1870s, with players taking the role of a Black former slave fighting for justice in the South and confronting an emerging Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>However, Ubisoft reportedly cancelled the project in part due to the reception to Black samurai Yasuke in this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which sparked a backlash over diversity and inclusion.</p>

<p>Game File spoke with five current and former anonymous Ubisoft employees involved in the project who were all enthusiastic about the game but were left frustrated by its cancellation.</p>
<p>Reportedly, word of the project's cancellation filtered through Ubisoft from Paris last July, in part due to the backlash against Yasuke, but also due to concern over the current political climate in the US.</p>
<p>"Too political in a country too unstable, to make it short," said one source.</p>
<p>"I was terribly disappointed but not surprised by leadership," said another. "They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political 'status quo' and take no stand, no risk, even creative."</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed franchise boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">Marc-Alexis Coté spoke with Eurogamer about the backlash against Yasuke last year</a> following the game's reveal. Discussing the "shifting cultural landscape" around representation in media, he said: "These conversations can influence how our games are perceived, but rather than shy away from those conversations, we should see them as an opportunity.</p>
<p>"Assassin's Creed has always been about exploring the full spectrum of human history, and by its very nature, that history is diverse. Staying true to history means embracing the richness of human perspectives - without compromise."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">Ubisoft announced its new Tencent-funded subsidiary Vantage Studios</a>, which will now be responsible for the company's biggest franchises, including Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Then, at the start of this week, Ubisoft revealed the Saudi-funded DLC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TjZ8XG8QBY&amp;t=3s">Valley of Memory</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>.</p>

<p>"I'll take on all of you!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has shared a fresh trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> Year 3 Fighter Pass update on <strong>October 15th</strong>, this time shining the spotlight on the 'Mech Zangie-F' costume.</p>
<p>The character first made an appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/marvel_super_heroes_vs_street_fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a> and has since been included in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/street_fighter_iv">Street Fighter IV</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a> as an alternate costume for Zangief. The design for Street Fighter 6 is quite a bit more industrial than previous incarnations, but we're digging the overall look.</p>
<p>Of course, the main draw for the new update will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/get-your-first-proper-look-at-c-viper-gameplay-in-street-fighter-6">the new playable character C.Viper</a>. Originally introduced in Street Fighter IV, she since appeared in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultimate_marvel_vs_capcom_3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a> but skipped the fifth main Street Fighter entry as a playable fighter.</p>
<p>Her appearance comes with a brand-new look, but players will also be able to unlock a 'classic' costume of sorts that will bring back her iconic design from the fourth game.</p>
<p>In addition to C.Viper, Alex and Ingrid will also be added to the fighter roster as part of the Year 3 Fighter Pass in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The file sizes for Pokémon Legends: Z-A have dropped ahead of next week’s release, and, as is customary with titles on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles, you won’t have to clear out too much space.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the first Pokémon title to launch on Switch 2, though it’s also available on the original Switch console and launches on both platforms on October 16.</p>



<p>While Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-vs-switch-2-performance-which-version-should-you-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t include any additional features or content</a> that have been advertised ahead of launch, the file size is almost double on the newer console.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Small sizes. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Preloads for Pokémon Legends: Z-A are now available on both platforms, as of October 8, which confirms the file size on both generations of Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>On the original console, you’ll need 4.0 GB of space for the game, while those on Switch 2 require 7.7 GB of space, which even those of us who struggle with maths can spot is almost double the size.</p>



<p>The small size of the game on the original Switch may raise eyebrows when compared to previous titles, with Scarlet &amp; Violet clocking in at around 6.8 GB, Legends: Arceus being 6.1 GB, while Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl were 6.9 GB. Those pale in comparison to Sword and Shield, though, which was 12.4 GB.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A on the original Switch is, therefore, the smallest file size of a mainline Pokémon game since Sun &amp; Moon on the Nintendo 3DS.</p>



<p>The smaller size can be explained by the setting of Legends: Z-A taking place solely in Lumiose City, rather than an entire region, but the new battle mechanics could have pushed the file size up in comparison.</p>



<p>Either way, it’s good news on both platforms for any player who doesn’t want to uninstall other games to make room for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, as you should have more than enough space.</p>



<p>Which starter are you going to choose in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It even had its own theme song — Haruo Minami’s 'Sekai no kuni kara konnichiwa' (Hello from the countries of the world), which Kojima quoted in his essay — with lyrics that focus on saying "hello" and "holding hands" across countries and borders (the song is on <a href="https://youtu.be/NyRgp8r0mwo?si=73PZdSfGxM561D8U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a> with English subtitles).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the Expo, I experienced 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind' up close. I said 'hello' and 'shook hands' with (avant-garde artist) Taro Okamoto, (sci-fi novelist) Sakyo Komatsu, (architects) Kenzo Tange and Kisho Kurokawa, and (fashion designers) Junko Koshino and Hanae Mori. It was all a shocking 'close encounter of the third kind,'" Kojima remembered. "Technology, science, design, fashion, history, the world, culture, society. You could say that that 'hello' back then shaped who I became. 'Shaking hands' with the Expo changed my life and my vision of the future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima explained that "the Expo's greatness wasn't just in the glimpses it offered of cutting-edge technology and the daily life of the future. It showed me the global diversity of nations, ethnicities, races, religions, customs, and histories. It embodied the essence of 'past and future' and 'the world and harmony.' Without that Expo, I wouldn’t have developed my future-oriented and globalized outlook. Metal Gear and Death Stranding would not have come into being."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the major attractions of Expo '70 was the Moon Rock at the U.S. pavilion, which had been brought back from the Moon by Apollo 12 astronauts the previous year. Despite his many visits, Kojima said that "unfortunately, the U.S. pavilion, where I’d hoped to see the Moon Rock, was too crowded, so I never got to see it with my own eyes." He also recalled waiting over two hours to get into the U.S.S.R pavilion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does Kojima feel about the current Expo 2025 that is being held in Osaka, and how did his experience compare? In a <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/67790" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>follow-up essay</u></a> published in An-An, Kojima wrote about visiting Expo 2025 on a very rainy day, camera in tow again: "I wanted to see for myself how 'globalism' and 'visions of the future' have changed over the past 55 years, and how the baton will be passed on (to future generations)." However, the experience gave Kojima a "strange feeling."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Metal Gear Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer explained: "I didn't get that sense of a tremendous future like I did as a child (at Expo '70). It wasn't thrilling or exciting. Just a ceaseless, predictable tomorrow stretching on and on. It wasn't that there was no 'future' — rather that I couldn't ascertain the next 'tomorrow' for myself. The 'future' I dreamed of at that (1970) Expo — I've already experienced most of it. Robots, videophones and moving walkways have become commonplace. The tomorrow that this (2025) Expo promotes is one that children will witness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima gave the opinion that World Expos are primarily for children, as they are the ones who will take mankind into the future. Whether the futuristic designs at the 2025 Expo will be representative of what the real future will be is "something old people can never know." However, Kojima added that he enjoyed the Expo: "Although I will not be able to experience this future firsthand, I plan to go again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any player of Metal Gear Solid or Death Stranding doesn’t have to look far to see how both series feature diverse casts of characters, with stories often set in the near future that grapple with both the tremendous possibilities and dangers of technology. MGS1 explored genetic engineering and the concept of gene-therapy enhanced soldiers, MGS2 delved into the dangers of internet censorship and human-sounding AI chatbots (making it an interesting revisit in 2025), while MGS4 showed a mech-filled future in which paramilitary conglomerates wage endless wars for profit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its Chiral Network, Death Stranding holds up a mirror to the benefits and dangers of the internet and digital society, and the struggle to reconnect a fragmented, post-apocalyptic world. Legacy and passing on the future to subsequent generations are also big Kojima themes, and it seems they were shaped by his childhood experiences of Expo '70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a side note, the Expo '70 site is still open to the public today, although all the pavilions that awed the young Kojima have since been demolished. Now called the Expo'70 Commemorative Park, it still features the event's symbolic Tower of the Sun, a sculpture by Taro Okamoto.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Kojima Productions.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

However, the idea quickly turned messy when "Doja Cat," via Fortnite's account, seemingly posting a reference to "rose toys" (a vibrating adult toy). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back on Doja Cat's <em>actual</em> X account, the rapper broke the fourth wall and stated that Fortnite's posts were all pre-planned, and that she'd told Epic Games not to make the sex toys reference. "S*** cringe as f*** now I'm embarrassed," Doja Cat wrote, followed by a wilted rose emoji. Fortnite then deleted the post referencing "rose toys" shortly after. Doja Cat then deleted all of her messages referencing the incident.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/08/untitled-1-1759952211464.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite and Doja Cat's now-deleted posts. Image credit: X / IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some onlookers have suggested the whole incident was planned, including Doja Cat's typically-messy fourth wall break. But that theory would seem to rely on Fortnite itself being comfortable posting about an adult toy on its social media account which is followed by millions of young fans, which seems unlikely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you'll be able to snap up a Doja Cat skin from Fortnite's Shop, alongside an array of other famous faces. These include (deep breath): Wednesday Addams, Jason Voorhees, Scooby-Doo (plus also Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred), Black Phone's Grabber, Terrifier's Art the Clown, Ghostface and... even more. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2238260585-1759997531382.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doja Cat's Jimmy Fallon appearance, sitting on her Fortnite crown of thorns.

As for Fortnite itself, its new spooky gameplay extends beyond the game's main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes. A fresh Reload map, Nitemare Island, will debut tomorrow, October 10, featuring a Halloween-themed town and looming castle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Fortnitemares comes hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-fortnite-reveals-kpop-demon-hunters-rumi-outfit">the game's big KPop Demon Hunters collaboration</a>, which will run until November 1.

Oh, and $20 billion in debt.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The move will see EA become a private company, but a lot of questions around what could become the largest leveraged buyout ever (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/electronic-arts-go-private-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-2025-09-29/">according to Reuters</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) remain. In search of answers, we spoke to a number of analysts to understand how the&nbsp;seismic&nbsp;buyout could impact Electronic Arts' thousands of employees, its products, and the wider video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of how the deal is structured, the new ownership group will collectively contribute $36 billion, with the final $20 billion coming via debt financed through JP Morgan Chase Bank. The sale will take Electronic Arts off the stock market and place it into the hands of private equity investors, but the pressure of that $20 billion in debt is looming large.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The move is called a leveraged buyout because a portion of the deal is financed through debt. There's a chance the company could kick on and generate a profit. Or it might become overwhelmed by that debt and go bankrupt—which is precisely what happened when private equity firms purchased Toys R Us in 2005 in a $6.6 billion deal that saddled the company with $5 billion in debt.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/laid-off-zenimax-online-studios-developers-form-sackbird-studios" target="_self" data-discover="true">Laid off ZeniMax Online Studios developers form Sackbird Studios</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The retailer filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and Canada in 2017 because any cash it did make was used to pay off that debt,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketplace.org/story/2019/06/12/a-look-back-at-kkr-the-investment-firm-that-bought-out-toys-r-us-among-others">according to Marketplace</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The difference here is that Toys R Us was in worse shape than Electronic Arts at the time of its sale, struggling to compete with online marketplaces like Amazon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The $55 billion buyout saddles EA with debt that only makes sense through new revenue streams&quot;">"The $55 billion buyout saddles EA with debt that only makes sense through new revenue streams"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PitchBook gaming analyst Eric Bellomo told Game Developer that "the record of leveraged buyouts is mixed," pointing to the failures of Toys R Us and Joann Fabrics but the success of Hilton and Dell. Silver Lake, in particular, will be a boon to this endeavor, he said: "Silver Lake brings meaningful experience in gaming through its position in Unity and a strong track record of top-quartile funds. Historically, the firm has performed as a third-quartile manager overall."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, market research and consulting firm DFC Intelligence founder David Cole explained leveraged buyouts remain "high risk" and often result in "asset sales and short term cost cutting" in the hopes of delivering long-term success. "It all comes down to execution and that remains to be seen," he added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Heart Machine making layoffs and ending development on Hyper Light Breaker</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Electronic Arts has significant revenue flow—$7.5 billion in fiscal year 2025—that will be important in paying off its debt. But, according to New York University School of Business assistant professor Joost van Dreunen, the company will likely shift priorities to focus on its most profitable areas. He told Game Developer that means potential layoffs and, perhaps, the sale of "dormant IP" like Command &amp; Conquer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The $55 billion buyout saddles EA with debt that only makes sense through new revenue streams—likely sports betting and integrated media ventures," van Dreunen said in an email. "Going private removes Wall Street's quarterly pressure, allowing for more creative freedom. However, restructuring will follow. EA will likely split into sports and non-sports divisions, with some operations potentially relocated to Saudi Arabia. For studios, this means freedom from earnings calls but closer oversight from investors pursuing geopolitical objectives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Electronic Arts said in an employee FAQ made public through a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-55-billion-take-private-won-t-result-in-immediate-layoffs">that there will be no "immediate" changes to jobs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, teams, or daily work—i.e., no "immediate" layoffs. How long is immediate? That's the question for Electronic Arts employees as the closing date for the deal draws nearer.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-nexon-ceo-criticizes-fad-obsessed-industry-executives" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Nexon CEO criticizes fad-obsessed industry executives</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen said a "culture shift begins immediately," even though the closure is months away. "Once a sale is finalized, priorities shift overnight toward strategic alignment with buyer objectives," he added. "Expect EA's management to quietly reorganize around sports and live-service divisions in anticipation of new ownership. Going private also buys CEO Andrew Wilson time to prove </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can anchor the post-merger narrative."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventual layoffs and restructuring are "inevitable," he claimed, as the company reviews its assets. Cole, from DFC Intelligence, said the nature of debt means cutbacks often follow, along with the divestment of "non-essential assets."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We see EA doubling down on their high profile sports games and live services," Cole said. "They may look to sell [off other studios and franchises] to pay off debt. You may see EA shopping around some of its smaller franchises/studios."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen agreed. He said the new owners will likely focus on Electronic Arts' sports franchises, which drive a ton of revenue, meaning the rest of the publisher's catalog could face "aggressive 'right-sizing' ahead of potential sell-offs."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bellomo suggested that mobile gaming, and, of course, Battlefield, could drive the future of Electronic Arts.&nbsp;"EA is almost certainly evaluating potential synergies in mobile gaming, vis-a-vis Scopely in particular, and preparing for the upcoming launch of Battlefield, which will remain a key focus in the months ahead," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bellomo feels&nbsp;the company's broad strategy is unlikely to shift dramatically as Electronic Arts continues to rely on "core cash-generating franchises and steady revenue streams from in-app purchases, microtransactions, and similar sources."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Saudi Arabia and other investors are adding capital to acquire cultural legitimacy&quot;">"Saudi Arabia and other investors are adding capital to acquire cultural legitimacy"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen noted that this particular leveraged buyout is a little different than others due to Saudi Arabia's involvement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Gaming is the new oil," van Dreunen said. "Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is leveraging it to purchase global cultural relevance while diversifying beyond petroleum. With nearly 60 percent of Saudis, approximately 21 million people, playing games, and the domestic market projected to grow 56 percent to $2.8 billion by 2026, EA represents the crown jewel in [Saudi Arabia capital] Riyadh's Vision 2030 strategy to establish itself as a global gaming hub."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He continued: "This LBO diverges from the traditional playbook: instead of cutting costs to service debt, Saudi Arabia and other investors are adding capital to acquire cultural legitimacy. They're likely indifferent to short-term margins, viewing EA as a long-term anchor for broader entertainment ambitions. This could temporarily insulate EA from layoffs and creative risk aversion, though debt always comes due eventually."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saudi Arabia's investment into the video game industry is part of a larger strategy to acquire that cultural cache, with the country having already sunk billions into the games and esports industries through its Public Investment Fund.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This year, Saudi-owned esports and video game firm&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/pokemon-go-and-niantic-s-game-business-is-being-sold-to-the-saudi-state">Savvy Games Group acquired the majority of Pokemon Go maker Niantic's video game business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;for $3.5 billion.

"Once state-backed investors treat games as geopolitical assets, the floodgates open," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That means bigger budgets, fewer exits, and politics embedded in content decisions. For developers, that means deeper pockets but heightened scrutiny over cultural representation. Recent tariffs and barriers to high-skilled talent entering the U.S. also create openings for markets like Europe to expand their gaming footprint. The center of gravity in gaming is shifting from market dynamics to geopolitical power plays."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-gaming-is-the-new-oil-how-the-ea-buyout-diverges-from-the-traditional-playbook-]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Veteran game developers from Zenimax Online Studios have announced the formation of a new employee-owned game development company: Sackbird Studios. The small team is composed of several developers from both The Elder Scrolls: Online team, and those who were working on the cancelled sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird.</p>
<p>This new studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-union-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-states-those-impacted-will-depart-with-dignity">formed in the wake of widespread layoffs at Zenimax Online Studios</a>, is employee-owned according to the announcement <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">posted on its fresh-faced website</a>. It has a runway for multiple years, and is apparently totally self-funded. This means the devs at Sackbird have a few years to make a game off their own dime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">without any stockholders or massive international corporations getting involved in things</a>.</p>
<p>This announcement came with a bit of context as to the studio's formation. Project Blackbird's cancellation seemingly acted as the push Sackbird's founders needed to go their own way, with the new studio aimed at "avoiding pitfalls" the team have seen firsthand.</p>

<p>David Worley, COO at Sackbird Studios, wrote as part of this announcement: "After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets [...] We're fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games."</p><p>Lee Ridout, CEO at Sackbird Games, also added his own statement, writing: "We're grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people [...] When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft--and our team--was to create a studio where creative independence isn't negotiable."</p>
<p>Following the cancellation of the in-development MMO, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-head-matt-firor-announces-departure-following-widespread-layoffs-and-the-cancellation-of-in-development-mmo">Zenimax Online Studios head Matt Firor left the company</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft allegedly cancelled plans for a new Assassin's Creed game set in in the aftermath of the American Civil War last year, with online moaning about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> co-protagonist Yasuke and concerns over the volatility of the modern day US political climate being cited as reasons.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Game File</a>, which claims the game would have starred a black former slave who moves westwards from the south in search of a new life. He'd subsequently be recruited by the series' Assassins and return to the south in a story that'd involve confronting the rise of Ku Klux Klan during the Reconstruction era that spanned the 1860s and 70s.</p>
<p>Game File cites current and former Ubisoft staff who say that the game, which was in the concept phase, was canned in July 2024. Ubisoft management reportedly pointed to online vitriol in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke">black samurai Yasuke</a> being revealed as one of Shadows' protagonists as a reason behind the move, as well as concerns about the US' current political climate. The latter is alleged to have been the bigger factor in the cancellation. As one of Game File's sources put it, the game was viewed as being "too political in a country too unstable".</p>
<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ubisoft-shares-plummet-it-guides-further-cash-burn-2025-05-15/">rocky financial state</a> was also a reported factor in the decision, making execs keen to steer away from perceived risks. "I was terribly disappointed but not surprised by leadership," one of Game File's sources said. "They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political ‘status quo’ and take no stand, no risk, even creative."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's handling of the Yasuke controversy was rather topsy-turvy, with Shadows developers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">defending their work</a> while managment types like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">CEO Yves Guillemot</a> tried to pull the old 'no politics here in a video game, please stop thinking we might have thoughts to express in this video game' cop-out.</p><p>It's not like the company hasn't backed games that tackled issues like slavery before. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>, the beloved entry that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">reportedly getting the remake or remaster tratement at the moment</a>, span-off into Freedom Cry, which tells the tale of former slave Adewale fighting to free slaves in Saint-Domingue. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-liberation">Assassin's Creed III: Liberation</a> deals with similar themes, as you'd expect when making games set in periods of history when colonialism and its effects had a big impact on society and folks' everyday lives.</p>
<p>You can perhaps understand the risk aversion if you only look at the bottom line, but it's depressing to see a game spoken enthusiastically about by its developers be lobbed out of the window because of the state of affairs in modern day America. If anything, that would have made releasing a game exploring these themes even more important and commendable.</p>

<p>Fortnitemares 2025 has kicked off, and Epic Games is going for broke in this year’s content drop, which features the largest ever list of collabs in the event’s history.</p>



<p>The annual Halloween event is a fan-favorite, featuring limited-time content, exclusive skins, and special events in game, and Fortnitemares 2025 is bigger than ever.</p>



<p>It was already revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghostface-scooby-doo-r-e-p-o-coming-in-fortnitemares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and R.E.P.O</a> would be featured as collabs, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat appearing as an in-game boss</a>, but the full list of collabs is even more impressive.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnitemares-2025-includes-nine-major-collabs">Fortnitemares 2025 Includes Nine Major Collabs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Iconic. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reveals at the start of Fortnitemares have showcased a further five major collabs in the event this year, bringing the grand total up to nine.</p>



<p>Wednesday Addams, from the hit Netflix series, Jason Vorhees, Poppy’s Playtime, and The Terrifier all feature among the collabs in the event, which is due to be available until the end of the current season on November 1.</p>



<p>The content drop includes two Jam Tracks from Doja Cat’s latest album, along with the landmark Season 10 of Fortnite Festival. This time around, rather than focusing on a single artist, the Music Pass is full of hits from stars around the world.</p>



<p>Elton John, Motionless in White, and Fall Out Boy all feature in the Season 10 Music Pass, while there are two Fortnite-original outfits available too.</p>



<p>Season 10 of Fortnite Festival is due to end on November 29, when a new Icon event will begin, which arrives ahead of the start of Season 7, expected in December.</p>

            <p>Three more SNES games have arrived on Nintendo Switch Online this month, including one game previously exclusive to Japan.</p>
<p>That's Mario &amp; Wario, which originally used the Super Famicom Mouse to control a fairy who guides Mario through each level. It's now coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> globally for the first time thanks to the new console's mouse controls.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-paint-finally-comes-to-nintendo-switch-online-and-it-makes-great-use-of-an-underused-switch-2-feature">joins Mario Paint</a> as two games on the service requiring a mouse to play (either Joy-Con 2 or a USB mouse).</p>

            <p>Fortnitemares is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s Halloween event, and this year it's headlined by rapper Doja Cat alongside horror icons Jason, Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and more.</p>
<p>Players can expect a whole load of horror-themed skins, as well as Nitemare Island as a Fortnite Reload map featuring spooky locations.</p>
<p>The event starts today and runs until 1st November. You can check out the characters in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Two Jam Tracks from Doja Cat's new album Vie are also coming to the game: AAAHH MEN! and Gorgeous.</p>
<p>However, the launch didn't quite go to plan on social media. Doja Cat was meant to take over the Fortnite X account on Wednesday ahead of the Fortnitemares announcement, but the account (which had her in-game avatar as the profile picture) posted a message about "rose toys" some followers presumed was in reference to sex toys.</p>
<p>The rapper herself then responded: "I told them not to man that's not even me. I said this yesterday and then said 'don't post that' :/." The post was quickly taken down, but the exchange was screenshotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/doja-cat-fortnite-sex-toy-deleted-skin-halloween-2025-2000633338">Kotaku</a>.</p>

<p>And while some followers have suggested it was all planned, it seems unlikely Epic would allow a post about sex toys on the Fortnite account.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Epic to confirm if Doja Cat was behind the posts.</p>
<p>This blunder follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-confirms-no-creative-intentions-connecting-controversial-fortnite-emote-with-peacemaker-tv-show">removal of the Peacemaker dance emote</a> last month due to connotations of Nazism. A revised version of the emote is due back today after Epic confirmed "no creative intentions" connecting the emote with the TV show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Chinese analyst group called XR Research Institute has claimed that the next Valve Virtual Reality headset has already entered production and will ship this year, with an estimated initial order of 400K-600K units in the first year. </p>



<p>The news has been <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by UploadVR</a> and confirmed by Valve leakers Tyler McVicker and Brad Lynch (SadlyItsBradley). The latter also <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141425801822419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that two VR headset models, Deckard DV1 and Deckard DV2, have appeared in the latest SteamVR beta update. According to Valve's nomenclature, DV units are supposedly the final stage of in-development hardware before retail units, which are labeled 'PV'.</p>



<p>This suggests two headsets could be coming instead of just one, or at least two SKUs. Either way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous rumor</a> that Valve's second Virtual Reality headset, Deckard, would launch in late 2025 seems much more likely now. That rumor pointed to a $1200 price tag, which remains unconfirmed by other leakers at this time.</p>



<p>Deckard will be Valve's second attempt with Virtual Reality following the Index, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in June 2019 at $999</a>. The Index also got a so-called killer application: its purchase came with a free copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-release-date-valve-index-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, the first new installment (albeit technically a prequel) in the series in a long time. Half-Life: Alyx was long considered the gold standard when it comes to triple-A Virtual Reality games, but even that was not enough to really sell consumers on the Index. As of January 2025, only 13.2% of the VR headsets connected to the Steam platform were Index devices, as revealed by the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey.</p>



<p>Has Valve prepared another new game to try and boost the sales of its upcoming Deckard VR headset? Either way, we should know soon. Brad Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141799560200611">seems to think</a> an official announcement could come either this month or the next one. </p>
