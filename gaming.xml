Artwork revealing characters from the under-wraps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been posted online, ahead of this evening's big reveal trailer going live. 
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to watch the Assassin's Creed Shadows reveal trailer at 5pm UK time tonight - but ahead of that, artwork which looks set to be used on the game's box cover has appeared on the internet. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft appears to have removed several instances of this image from social media already, inadvertantly confirming its authenticity, but other copies still remain. For those looking to go in completely unspoiled, look away now.

<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows looks to feature two protagonists: a female ninja and a male samurai. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork of the pair shows them posing with a hatchet on a rope and, as you'd expect, a samurai sword. Is one of them wearing the series' iconic hidden blade weapon? It's hard to say for certain. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1crz4f3/assassins_creed_shadows_official_game_artwork/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Official Game Artwork</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lift_Off_/">u/Lift_Off_</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
The imagery, posted to reddit, lines up with previously-leaked details of the game - specifically that one of its main characters would be the historical figure of Yasuke, a man of African origin who travelled to Japan and later served the Japanese lord Oda Nobunaga. 
</p>
<p>
This also places the game quite firmly in time - around 1582.
</p>
<p>
As for the female ninja, leaks suggest her name is Naoe, who will have a more traditional Assassin's Creed origin story that pushes her to join the Assassins faction and battle the evil-doer Templars.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has featured dual protagonists before, of course, such as siblings Jacob and Evie Frye in the Victorian London-set Syndicate - the first major project from Shadows' own talented Ubisoft Quebec team. 
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Egypt-set Origins also had you play as main character Bayek's wife Aya for certain sections - with the suggestion from the game's developers that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-report-into-ubisoft-culture-highlights-reluctance-to-let-you-play-as-a-woman-in-assassins-creed">these had once been intended to be more integral</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft will officially detail Assassin's Creed Shadows later today - join us then for our first look at the game's trailer and plenty of analysis of what's in store.

NieR series producer Yosuke Saito has joined NieR series director Yoko Taro on a new project, along with series composer Keiichi Okabe.
</p>
<p>
Saito revealed the news in an interview with former Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi in the latest Famitsu magazine (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe">Gematsu</a>).
</p>
<p>
"I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," said Saito. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."

<p>

"I'm doing various things with the idea of creating something that does not yet exist," he continued. "I can't devote my time to that fully, so most of it has been left to the staff, but it's turning into something quite interesting. I'm looking forward to the day we can announce it."
</p>
<p>
The NieR series - published by Square Enix - has proven incredibly popular, specifically the PlatinumGames developed NieR: Automata. In 2021, a remaster of NieR Replicant was released.
</p>
<p>
It's unknown what's next for the NieR series, though some fans believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yoko-taro-teases-nier-3">Taro was teasing a new game in the series earlier this year</a>. Is that what Saito and Okabe are also working on? We'll have to wait and see.

</p>
<p>
Still, if you're looking for something new to play in a similar vein, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>. Taro and Stellar Blade creative director Hyung-tae Kim discussed their games together, as both share similar themes and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-is-superior-to-nier-automata-says-yoko-taro">Taro even said Stellar Blade is superior to NieR: Automata</a> (he's wrong).

            <p>The upcoming Mortal Kombat film sequel has secured itself a release date.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema's Mortal Kombat 2 will arrive in cinemas on 24th October, 2025, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/mortal-kombat-2-companion-weapons-release-dates-1235916567/">Deadline</a> reports. It will also play in Imax.</p>
<p>In response to this news, the film's producer Todd Garner said this somewhat far-off release date was not simply to do with how long the project is in post production. "There are numerous factors that come into play such as competitive releases, the studio's slate, marketing focus, audience availability, etc, etc, as well as availability of Imax screens," <a href="https://twitter.com/Todd_Garner/status/1790545184004116651">Garner</a> wrote on social media platform X.</p>

</figure>
<p>Mortal Kombat 2 serves as a sequel to 2021's Mortal Kombat, and is again directed by Simon McQuoid. Joining the cast for the upcoming release is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/karl-urban-reportedly-in-line-to-play-johnny-cage-in-mortal-kombat-2">The Boys and Lord of the Rings star Karl Urban</a>, who will play Johnny Cage.</p>
<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and has been cast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor in chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it "boring".</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sony shipped five times more PlayStation 5 consoles than Microsoft managed with Xbox Series X/S in the last quarter.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, who's done some digging after Sony's latest financial report released yesterday.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 shipped 4.5m units in the last quarter, meaning Sony has now sold over 59m PS5 consoles in total. This is roughly equivalent to PS4 at the same point in its lifecycle.

<p>

Microsoft, meanwhile, has seen a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boosts-microsoft-earnings-but-xbox-console-sales-plummet">31 percent year-on-year drop in Xbox console sales</a>, although specific figures have not been released.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, PS5 sales dropped by 29 percent year-on-year, although console sales are up for the year as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Together it's a sign of slowing console sales across the industry, although overall sales for PlayStation consoles are significantly higher than Xbox Series X/S sales. That's matched by Sony's seeming inability to sell more consoles than the previous generation.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>5. The PlayStation 5 shipped 4.5 million units in the last quarter. According to our estimates, this is almost 5x more than the Xbox Series X|S shipped in the same period. </p><p>(This is a bonus one for the console warriors + my rent is due)</p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1790464370742349967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Again, diversifying income is proving integral. It's why Sony is pushing PC sales, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 now the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>. The company hasn't, however, disclosed the latest PlayStation Plus subscription numbers.

</p>
<p>
It's also why Sony is using the metric of play time on PlayStation as an indicator of success. That's increased 15 percent year-on-year, reaching its second highest level ever (the highest since the pandemic).
</p>
<p>
Also announced yesterday were the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">replacements for former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a>. PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst will be in charge of game development, while Hideaki Nishino will oversee hardware.

</p>
<p>
Sales in Sony's games segment increased by 17 percent year-on-year, while operating income increased by 40.2bn yen year-on-year to a 290.2bn yen total.
</p>
<p>
Still, earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony laid off 900 staff</a>, including the closure of its London Studio.

            <p>
The Sims 4 is preparing for a summer of slinky, sexy free and paid updates according to its newly revealed roadmap, starting with a refreshed batch of swimsuits today.
</p>
<p>
There's not a huge amount to report on the free swimsuit refresh - they now come in more colours and varieties to better suit a range of body shapes and sizes - but EA notes it's also updated a few other summer-adjacent clothing items, including the tankini and wrap top, to usher in its season of sauciness.
</p>
<p>
As per the publisher's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OndDCMYcsnk">new roadmap reveal video</a>, the next few steamy months will bring two free "stylish" updates, two destination kits, and one "flirtatious" expansion pack. Specifics are scarce, but we can make a few educated guesses based on EA's clues. The free updates, for instance, are accompanied by the text, "Polished my look for a sultry splash" - suggesting that, alongside today's swimsuit update, we might also be getting further enhancements to nails.

<p>
And as for those destination kits, the visuals accompanying this part of the video - as well as the text, "A little nectar led to a provocative plunge" - seem to be pointing toward kits themed around bars and public pools. The "flirtatious" expansion, however, remains largely mysterious, with the on-screen text - "Made waves, but we WooHoo'd anyway" - revealing little.
</p>
<p>
While we wait for EA to show its hand, Sims 4 players on PC can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-blooming-rooms-kit">head over to the publisher's official store</a> and pick up the plant-themed Blooming Rooms Kit - which normally costs £4.99 - for free until 31st May. This one's all about adding a bit of greenery to your Sims' lives, because what better way to prepare for the sexy summer ahead than with excessive foliage everywhere?

            <p>
American Truck Simulator's determined trundle across the picturesque highways and byways of the United States continues this week with the launch of its latest paid expansion - and 15th explorable state - Nebraska, on 16th May.
</p>
<p>
Nebraska was revealed to be in the works last August, bringing American Truck Simulator's current tally of confirmed explorable states up to 17. Since its release in 2016, the trucking sim has expanded to include California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The arrival of Nebraska this week brings us up to 15 states, and developer SCS has already announced Arkansas and Missouri are on the way.
</p>
<p>
Staying with Nebraska, though, SCS describes it thusly: "Located in the heart of the Great Plains, Nebraska's vast and diverse landscape consists of prairies, rolling hills, and the crucial Platte River. While hauling cargo through the Cornhusker State along historic routes, you will have many opportunities to witness iconic landmarks and truly immerse yourself in the state's spirit, from its pioneer history to the modern energy of cities full of ever-growing industries."

<p>
SCS' digital reimagining of Nebraska includes the cities of Lincoln and Omaha, as well as some of the state's most recognisable landmarks and attractions - with the likes of Scotts Bluff National Monument, McConaughy Lake and the Kingsley Hydroplant, the Archway, and Carhenge so far confirmed. Expect the Nebraska expansion to cost around £9.99 when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543810/American_Truck_Simulator__Nebraska/">via Steam</a> on 16th May.
</p>
<p>
In related news, SCS has just released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/4167595132252267296?l=english">American Truck Simulator's expansive 1.50 update</a> after a short public beta. This introduces enhanced rendering features - including temporal anti-aliasing support and optimised light computation - as well as a substantial UI overhaul (featuring a flatter, more minimalist design), and the third phase of its ongoing California rework, intended to bring its ageing original state inline with more recent additions.
</p>
<p>
The latter introduces two new cities - San Jose and Modesto - as well as complete reworks of San Francisco, Oakland, Stockton, Santa Cruz, Huron, and Fresno. Major routes - including CA-1, US-101, I-5, CA-99, and US-395 - have also seen major overhauls, as has Yosemite National Park. All this, alongside new lane assistant and tooltips options, is available now.

The next Dead by Daylight chapter will be based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, with Vecna as the new Killer.
</p>
<p>
News of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-teases-dark-fantasy-era-with-dungeons-dragons-themed-chapter">new chapter was teased last week</a>, but in its anniversary stream today Behaviour unveiled further details.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the new chapter, a new 2v8 mode was announced, as well as an update on spin-off titles, and a tease of a new Castlevania chapter coming later this year.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything shown at the Dead by Daylight eighth anniversary stream.

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Castlevania chapters</h2>

<p>
Dungeons &amp; Dragons will form the basis for the next chapter of Dead by Daylight, available now in the Public Test Build and launching properly on 3rd June.
</p>
<p>
As usual, the chapter will include a new Killer, a new Survivor, and a new map.
</p>
<p>
While this may seem like a move away from the horror franchises Dead by Daylight is known for, Dungeons &amp; Dragons provides plenty of dark fantasy and will introduce magic for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The new Killer will be Vecna, a powerful lich and major antagonist in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. He's voiced by Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Ganondorf in Tears of the Kingdom, Vincent in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth).
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PR_Screenshot_1.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Vecna will have four spells for players to use. Fly will allow him to traverse maps quickly; with Mage Hand Vecna can hold palettes and lift them back up; Flight of the Damned is a necromancer projectile; and Dispelling Sphere will detect and dispell magical effects.
</p>
<p>
In a further nod to D&amp;D, when Vecna is a Killer special treasure chests will be found around maps. Once opened, a d20 dice roll will take effect to determine what players find: either regular items, or magical items to counter Vecna's spells. Rolling a critical success (20) will provide players with Vecna's cursed items to teleport from lockers or turn invisible, though these items will also injure players. However, rolling a critical fail (1) will result in a nasty surprise - perhaps a mimic chest?
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PR_Screenshot_4.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The new Survivor is a two-in-one bard and original creation by Behaviour. Players can choose either an elf female called Aestri Yazar, or a human male called Baermar Uraz. Further, a new map called Forgotten Ruins will include a dungeon, obviously, and plenty of D&amp;D references as part of its extensive underground component.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the stream, Behaviour also teased another new chapter coming to the game this year, based on Konami's Castlevania series. This was just a tease, though further information is expected on 6th August. Presumably, Dracula will be a Killer with one of the Belmonts as a Survivor? Either way, vampires will be a welcome addition to the game.
</p>
<h2>A new 2v8 party game mode</h2>

<p>
A new 2v8 mode will be added to Dead by Daylight by the end of summer. Rather than the usual 1v4 Killer and Survivor matches, this mode will have two Killers working together against eight Survivors.
</p>
<p>
As you may expect, this will fundamentally change how the game is played, so should be considered more of a party mode than ultra competitive. There also won't be hooks, instead downed Survivors will be sent to a cage.
</p>
<p>
Perks will also be removed; instead players choose from specific classes aimed at encouraging teamwork. Killers will also have team powers to promote coordination, though only five will be available: Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Huntress, Nurse. Maps will also be based on these Killers.
</p>
<p>
The mode will be introduced temporarily at first.
</p>
<p>What's more, Behaviour is introducing cross-progression later this summer, meaning players can continue with progress no matter which platform they play on.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Dead by Daylight spin-offs incoming</h2>

<p>
Behaviour provided updates on three spin-offs, one of which is available immediately for free.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, a new gameplay trailer for The Casting of Frank Stone was shown. This is a narrative horror game from Supermassive (The Quarry, Until Dawn), featuring the usual environmental puzzles, quick-time events, and the ability to shape the script through choices. It's set in 1980 and follows a group of friends creating a film, who uncover the secrets of an infamous serial killer in the process.
</p>
<p>
While no release date has been given, the developer is still aiming for a 2024 release. It will be around five to seven hours long, depending on choices made.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, Midwinter Entertainment is working on a new PvE game known as Project T. Players will take the role of trespassers whisked away to the realm of the Entity. It will be a third-person session-based game with guns, trucks, and talismans used against new enemies the Thrall.
</p>
<p>
It remains very early in development, but the Project T Insider Programme is launching to allow for fan input and closed playtests (on PC). 
</p>

<p>
Lastly, Behaviour is today launching What The Fog, a new two-person co-op roguelite game available for free on PC for those with a Behaviour account for a limited time (and $4.99 afterwards).
</p>
<p>
Like Jumanji, Survivors Claudette and Dwight are sucked into a cursed boardgame to battle against swarms of monsters with 3D gameplay and a cute, chibi art style. And if a player dies, they switch to support view to unleash spells until revived by their partner. 

</p>

            <p>Bethesda is known for its glitchy releases. In fact, in the run up to Amazon's TV adaptation of Fallout, showrunner Graham Wagner even reminisced about a bug he came across while playing The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall, stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-the-fallout-tv-show-wont-have-bugs-at-least-not-in-season-one">adding 'glitches' into a then-hypothetical second season</a> of the show was "definitely on [his] mind as a concept".</p>
<p>But, even the studio's less recent-releases are still faced with the age-old Bethesda bug problem, and patches haven't been able to sort them. In fact, it seems they have sometimes made them worse</p>
<p>Case in point, we have Fallout 4, which is currently having a resurgence thanks to Amazon's show. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-upgrade-launches-to-mixed-response-with-broken-mods-and-bugged-xbox-quality-mode">Bethesda finally released its long-awaited 'next-gen' patch</a> that included the promise of native applications for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, while those on higher-spec PCs would get widescreen and ultra-widescreen support. However, this patch was met with a mixed response, as it broke mods and only one of the game's two graphical options appeared to be working on Xbox Series X and S.</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-latest-graphical-update-is-here">Bethesda released another patch for Fallout 4</a> across platforms. This, the studio said, would allow players to "manage your control over the game's graphic fidelity or performance" and address a number of other issues players have been experiencing. And while some of these niggles have been fixed, others have not. Oh, and mods are shot again.</p>
<p>A quick scan over on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/">Steam's Fallout 4 forums</a> show a number of unimpressed players asking Bethesda to please stop updating the game. In a post titled "How bad is the update?", which was started soon after the initial next-gen patch went live but has been constantly added to since, players are reporting mods have once again been broken and other issues haven't been fixed.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSFalloutL/comments/1cre6uj/another_update_has_hit_the_fallout_4_modding/">Another update has hit the Fallout 4 modding community</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thewaffleofoz/">u/Thewaffleofoz</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSFalloutL/">TrueSFalloutL</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Also as pointed out, most of yesterday's update didn't actually target issues on PC, with consoles being the main focus. Another thread said the Fallout 4 team is still to fix bugs they believe should be "mandatory".</p>
<p>"What with black screen after launch on monitors 144 hz and above? What with weapon debris problem on rtx cards? Those two problems are known from couple years and still isn't official fixed from bethesda. This is a joke," it reads.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Bethesda for comment on how it plans to address mods and other issues in the future.</p> <div>

<p>This current spate of 'next-gen' grievances aside, Fallout 4 has proved popular ever since the TV series released in April. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">topped the PS4 download charts last month</a>, while Fallout generally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-has-more-than-doubled-its-player-counts-on-steam">"more than doubled its concurrent players" on Steam</a> over the weekend of 14th April.</p>

        <p>Decision contains "significant factual errors", Epic Games says.</p>

</header>    <div>



            <p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games has said it will fight back against a €1.1m (£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator, which has accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". 
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-imposes-fine-epic-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-children-fortnite-game">investigation by The Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets</a> (ACM) claims Epic Games "exploited the vulnerabilities of children" through "various design choices for its offerings in its Item Shop". 
</p>
<p>
This included, the ACM says, using ads aimed at encouraging kids to make purchases with slogans such as "get it now", and "misleading" sale countdown timers that gave the impression certain items would be removed from sale before they ultimately were. The ACM states Fortnite therefore violated "requirements of professional diligence".

In Epic Games' response, shared with Eurogamer, the company says the ACM's decision contains "significant factual errors about how Fortnite and the Item Shop operate" and that "the ACM is mandating changes that would result in a poor experience for players", which it will now appeal. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, however, Epic Games says it will make a change so Dutch players under the age of 18 "will not be able to see or purchase items that are in the shop for less than 48 hours, beginning 24th May".
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the ACM's decision, Epic Games noted it had already made a number of recent Item Shop changes, and had recently said it was adding a date to each item in the Item Shop so players could see how long it would be on sale for. This will be visible as of 24th May, and is designed to remove some of the vagueness around how long certain items might be available.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' statement on the matter goes on to highlight the other child safety features available in the game, such as Cabined Accounts with limited features and no purchase options by default for users under 16, plus other parental controls and spending limits. 
</p>
<p>
While hefty, the ACM's fine is nothing compared to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-epic-games-slapped-by-520m-ftc-fine">eye-opening $520m (£427m) penalty slapped down by the US Federal Trade Commission against Epic Games</a> in December 2022. That similarly related to so-called "dark patterns" meant to encourage spending. Epic Games did not contest that fine, and acknowledged at the time that its game had evolved considerably over time.

            <p>Supergiant has discussed its first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a> post-launch patch, which will be released at some point later this month.</p>
<p>While the team delivered smaller hotfixes periodically since Hades 2 was released in early access, this patch will include some more meaty changes, including ones focused on resource gathering and getting around.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a>, Supergiant said it didn't want gathering resources to "feel too frustrating" for players, so this will be addressed in some fashion in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The developer also said it has ideas for how to improve Melinoë's dash and sprint. "It's important to us that Melinoë [has] her own distinct style, and for players to be able to navigate her battles and other interactions in a nimble, responsive, expressive way," Supergiant elaborated, perhaps acknowledging at the moment she can feel very similar to control as Zagreus from the first Hades.</p>
<p>We can expect more details on Hades 2's first patch - which will also include other yet-to-be-specified refinements - closer to release. We will keep you posted as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>After this first patch, the studio said it will probably have "at least" one more patch in the pipeline. Then, it will shift its focus onto its first 'Major Update' for Hades 2. This is still some months away, but Supergiant said it will include new features and content. Also, the team doesn't plan on implementing <em>too </em>many balance changes just yet.</p>
<p>"We really appreciate you playing and taking the time to share your impressions with us," Supergiant closed. "Death to Chronos!"</p>

<p>Our Chris Donlan has been hands-on with Supergiant's first-ever sequel, and while it "may feel very comfortable and familiar", he believes Hades 2's "best weapon remains the power of surprise".</p>
<p>"Hades 2 often strikes me as more of the same at the moment, but - two things again! - one: maybe I'm not yet dialled in sufficiently to see the deeper, secret point of the whole thing. And, two: we're right at the start of this journey and it would not surprise me if the game I'm playing today, a game I already love, is not the game I'm playing a year from now," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer's Hades 2 review</a>. "And that's quite a thought."</p>

The long-rumoured The Legend of Zelda Lego set based on The Great Deku Tree will feature two different designs, according to the latest leaks.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.bricktastic.nl/lego/lego-77092-zelda-the-great-deku-tree-verschijnt-vermoedelijk-in-september-2024-update/">Bricktastic</a> reports (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-lego-zelda-great-deku-tree-will-be-released-in-september-for-e300-its-claimed/">VGC</a>), the set will be released in September and allow builders to choose between an Ocarina of Time design with green leaves, or a Breath of the Wild design with pink leaves.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the set will come with four minifigures representing Classic Link, Classic Young Link, Breath of the Wild Link and Breath of the Wild Zelda, and will also include shield and ocarina pieces.

<p>

The set will comprise 2500 bricks with a retail price of €299.99.
</p>
<p>
These details are in-line with previous rumours from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/great-deku-tree-lego-set-will-be-released-later-this-year-leaker-suggests">earlier this year</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-lego-zelda-set-seemingly-confirmed-by-copyright-removals">last year</a>.


</p>
<p>
Could we see an official announcement soon? After all, Tears of the Kingdom celebrates its one year anniversary this week.
</p>
<p>
The Zelda set would follow other Nintendo sets, like the previously released Mario sets and Animal Crossing sets. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-kart-sets-will-be-ready-to-race-in-2025">Lego Super Mario Kart set</a> will launch next year, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kk-slider-coming-to-new-lego-animal-crossing-sets">K.K.

            <p>
The hugely-popular Helldivers 2 has sold 12m copies on PC and PlayStation 5, enough to become Sony's fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time. 
</p>
<p>
Thanks in large part to its wild success on Steam, the PlayStation-published breakout hit shifted around 1m more than the previous record holder, 2022's God of War Ragnarök. 
</p>
<p>
Sony confirmed the sales record today in its just-published financial results, which also revealed a new running total for PS5 console sales: 59.3m, meaning the hardware stands roughly equivalent to where PS4 was at the same point in its lifecycle.

<p>
That 59.3m includes an impressive 20.8m PS5 consoles sold in the past 12 months alone, up 1.7m on the amount it sold in the year prior, though Sony had expected to shift even more - originally it had forecasted yearly sales of 25m. 
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, Sony said it would sell fewer consoles in the current financial year (18m in the 12 months ending 31st March 2025) which currently looks to be quiet for first-party PlayStation game launches. We are expecting the souped-up PS5 Pro console variant at some point nearer Christmas, however. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!</p><p>It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes 🤯</p><p>What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Helldivers2</a>.

<p>
Brighter points in Sony's financial results included software game sales being up year-on-year (77 percent of sales are now digital) and a boost to PlayStation Network monthly active users (118 million, up 10 million year-on-year). </p>
<p>
Once again, Sony did not disclose PlayStation Plus subscriber numbers, however.
</p>
<p>
Sony today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">confirmed its permanent replacements for now-departed former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan</a>. Two men will now share the CEO role, with PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst focused on game development and Hideaki Nishino overseeing PlayStation hardware. Both will report into PlayStation chairman Hiroki Totoki, who has been overseeing the business since Ryan's departure.
</p>
<p>
The outgoing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Ryan left PlayStation in March after nearly 30 years at Sony</a>. His era ended with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">job losses amounting to some 900 staff leaving the business</a>, and the closure of Sony's London Studio.

            <p>Sony has announced who will replace Jim Ryan as the company's CEO.</p>
<p>In a change, the company will be led by two CEOs, with Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino both stepping into new leadership positions.</p>
<p>Hulst will serve as CEO of the new Studio Business Group, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/a-message-from-hiroki-totoki-a-new-era-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">Sony announced</a> in a message to staff from interim CEO Hiroki Totoki. Nishino will meanwhile be appointed CEO of the company's Platform Business Group. The two will take up their new roles on 1st June, when chairman Totoki will also step away from his position as interim CEO.</p>

<p>In his new role, Hulst will be responsible for all first-party PlayStation game content, as well as bringing its franchises to new mediums such as film and television.</p>
<p>Hulst has served as head of PlayStation Studios, and previously led developer Guerrilla Games. Guerilla was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news071205killzonedev">acquired by Sony in 2005</a>. Since then, the studio has become best known for its work on the Horizon series.</p>
<p>"I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5, while preparing for the future," Hulst said in a statement (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-names-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-as-its-new-ceos">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). "The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment."</p>
<p>Nishino, meanwhile, was previously SVP of Sony's Platform Experience Group. He will continue to oversee technology, products, services, and platform experience as part of his new role as CEO of the company's Platform Business Group. In addition, he will also oversee third-party publisher and developer relations and commercial operations. This will include sales and marketing of hardware, services, and peripherals, Totoki said.</p>
<p>"We will continue to connect players and creators through world-class products, services, and technology," Nishino said in a statement following his appointment.</p>
<p>"I am honoured to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future."</p>
<p>Both Hulst and Nishino will report to Totoki when the changes come into effect on 1st June. Towards the end of his message, Totoki stated we will hear more on Sony's plans later this month, perhaps confirming a showcase is on the cards for May.</p>
<p>"The future is incredibly bright for [Sony Interactive Entertainment] and that is thanks to all of you," Totoki closed. "Since I became Chairman in October 2023, I have been inspired by your enthusiasm, innovative approaches, and teamwork. These values will serve us well as we embark on the exciting future for SIE."</p> <div>

<p>Former CEO Jim Ryan announced he would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">retiring from Sony back in September</a>, after nearly 30 years with the company. "I've relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners. But I've found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America," Ryan said last year.</p>
<p>Ryan left PlayStation in March, soon after the exec announced company-wide layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">equating to eight percent of its workforce</a>. This included the closure of PlayStation Studios' London Studio, plus reductions made within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Sony's Firesprite studio</a>.</p>

            <p>I think most would agree that the artist formerly known as Twitter has never been in more need of a thermonuclear cleansing. The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you're talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm's perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.</p>
<p>Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1788362032699555985">a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel</a> in which he challenged other developers to "take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results". Other developers have heeded the call. Here's a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0's (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/screenshot-saturday-mondays-you-want-screenshots-heres-screenshots">Screenshot Saturday Monday features</a>.</p><!--more-->

            <p>Old-school <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-explorator">The Explorator</a> contains much more intense shooty violence than the adorable lizardy folk that populate it might immediately suggest. I really want to use the word ‘zany’ without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I’m afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long before your relaxed jaunt down the corridors of the ship you begin the game on is interrupted by a legion of saber and machine-gun wielding nose-havers. You’re stuck with just a pistol at this point, but even then, bullet impact is screen-shakingly solid. The Explorator takes the tack of throwing big groups of not-that-smart dudes in your path, and it’s very satisfying to manically click them all to death. On the negative front, it does have a stamina bar, which I reject on a spiritual level for this kind of zippy strafer. But who knows - maybe there’s a good reason for such a restriction that's yet to reveal itself? Maybe it’s hidden in the below trailer?</p>

<p>The game does seem to slant towards a touch of RPG territory. You can, for example, equip armour, visit merchants, and sort your inventory. The island itself is huge, and exploration is thus encouraged. My wishlist currently includes a few more interactable elements to populate the island with more than just vistas and shooting. Maybe a few readables? I would like to know the history of both this place and the squeaky lizards that inhabit it. Either way, this art really rattles my saber. You can check it out for yourself via The Explorator’s free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015440/The_Explorator/">Steam demo</a>.</p>

            <p>Do you love the smell of napalm in the morning? If so, you'll probably love the smell of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>'s Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valheims-volcanic-ashlands-update-gets-first-proper-trailer-and-breakdown">a period of beta testing</a>. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EIQfQxQu_A">Possum</a>-esque.</p>

<p>Also in Valheim's Ashlands patch: 70+ new buildable items! 30+ new weapons! 30+ new crafting materials! 15 new food items and potions! Five new crafting station upgrades! Three new armour sets! Two new capes! A partridge in a pear tree, possibly! Developers Iron Gate Studios are also introducing new events, music and mechanics, including the ability to besiege the fortresses of the Charred using new catapults and rams. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4202496761515288277?l=english">full Steam listing</a> has detailed patch notes which spoil a few nasty surprises you might prefer to discover yourself. I will give away only this: be extra mindful of the possibility of incineration when dressing, crafting, constructing things, exploring the new biome on foot or sailing its coast.</p>
<p>The developers also have some advice about preparing for your first voyage to the Ashlands, which I am going to petrify for posterity in the shape of a blockquote, the grandest mausoleum available to modern games journalism:</p>
<blockquote>"Before you travel to the Ashlands, you should first make sure that you have defeated The Queen in the Mistlands. If you have done so on an earlier playthrough, remember that her dropped item is no longer a placeholder. Just like Eikthyr's antler lets you craft a pickaxe needed in the Black Forest, and just like The Elder drops a crypt key for the Swamps, the item from The Queen will be useful in the Ashlands! If you have the item already, you might need to toss it out of your inventory and pick it up again, for new recipes to trigger properly."</blockquote>
<p>In case it isn't already obvious, the Ashlands is a challenging environment. It's the penultimate biome in a deliberately difficult game, the developers remind us. So maybe brush up on your skills a bit in the Meadows or Black Forest before taking the plunge. You can also adjust the difficulty in the World Modifiers menu.</p>

<p>As always with Valheim updates, the new biome is also going to break a lot of existing mods, so consider uninstalling them (including modloaders that might boot mods up automatically) before playing. "If you don't want to play without mods, you will most likely have to wait a couple of days until the mod creator has updated their mod to be compatible with Valheim again," the developers note. I'm not savvy with the Valheim modding scene and am interested to know whether this last claim strikes modders as reasonable or presumptuous.</p>
<p>We're big Valheim enthusiasts round these parts. It's fourth on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a> and 13th on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">best co-op games</a>. Ah, if only I could drink in the reek of roasting monster vertebrae it'd be right up there at number one. Are there any other games you wish you could smell?</p>

            <p>Thrones of Decay - the expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> that finally made it viable to steamroll the old world with a doomstack of 20 tanks, just as Franz intended - just released around three weeks ago, but developers Creative Assembly are already on their third hotfix. <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/forums/7-patch-notes-amp-announcements/threads/5233-total-war-warhammer-iii-hotfix-5-0-3">This one</a> is mainly aimed at re-balancing an overly demanding new grudge system for the Dwarfs that punished players for stopping to enjoy a swift pint of Bugman’s instead of constantly being on the offensive, but also includes so many other fixes it’s veering into larger patch territory.</p>

<p>The age of reckoning, as this new dwarf rework is called, would previously give you ten turns to collect as many grudge-points as you could hammer out of your foes. After the time was up, you’d either get buffed or penalised, depending on how you performed. The issue was that the target numbers would rapidly get too demanding, often leaving players in the lowest tier   - known as ‘Elgi’, because the Khazalid word for ‘weak’ is the same word for ‘elf’. Now, the tiers have been reworked, so that the middling tier is more of a neutral state, and the grudge-points themselves are easier to achieve. There’s much more nuance than all this, so do have a read of the full patch notes if you’re interested. Me, I’m all for having some room for beer breaks. There is, after all, only so many times you can scream “they have wronged us!” before your throat gets dry.</p>
<p>The hotfix doth not cease its bounty there, though. At a glance, there’s at least an additional 30 items on the list. Of special note is a downsizing to Kislev’s frost wyrm, from roughly the size of Dread Saurian to more in-line with a carnosaur. Huge single entities may look imposing, but the bigger they are, the more missile fire they attract. Hopefully, this should make the wyrms a bit more nimble and survivable. Elsewhere in the patch, the 'channel magic' post battle option has been fixed to stop you always losing, and steam tanks now collide into foes with a more satisfying thud.</p>

It was 49 minutes and 25 seconds before someone shares the first screenshot of something they've built. The screenshot is broken now, but it was of a one-block wide bridge. 
</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, I pay a monthly Realms Plus subscription so I can adminstrate a server for my kid and I to play on, and so I can access some Marketplace mods in the Bedrock version of the game. (I also pay separately for individual mods not included in the subscription as-and-when). I then pay a second, separate Marketplace subscription so my kid can access a bunch of skins on the Switch version of the game. The Switch version of the game crashes constantly, fails to connect to Microsoft's account system and thus denies him access to his owned items, and the Marketplace is riddled with paid-for mods that simply no longer work. Its near-total technical inadequacy has, on several occasions, reduced my son to tears of despair and frustration. I hope Game Pass fails and Microsoft sinks into the ocean.
</p>
<p>Minecraft, the game itself, remains this pure, wondrous thing, seemingly able to infinitely repel the attempts to sully it by its owners or creator. My son and I go on adventures, we roleplay, we build things. Minecraft is a toybox, a dressing-up box, a pencil case of colouring pens, and sometimes just a sunny hill. I played it in 2009 and I played it yesterday and I have no reason to doubt I'll be playing it in 2039.
</p>
<p>You'll need to log-in in-game to collect the free items each day but they'll also announce each freebie via their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/minecraft">Instagram Stories</a>, Mojang say. </p>

            <p>Video games must  be three hours-long or infinite and nothing in between. The latest Steam event is designed to celebnrate the latter. The Endless Replayability Fest runs from now until May 20th, "celebrating games and demos you can play over and over again."

<p>Fests mix the discounts of a Steam sale with demos for upcoming and unreleased games. You'll therefore find plenty of demos <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/endlessly_replayable?tab=17">under the appropriate category</a>, including colony sims Norland and Mini Settlers, and several other games, none of which I'd heard of. I wonder if some developers are holding their demos back for next month's larger Steam Next Fest.
</p>
<p>There are plenty of discounts, meanwhile, split across categories such as Roguelike, Procedural Generation, Sandbox and Free To Play. Fabledom, a fantasy citybuilder that recently hit 1.0, is 35% off; Terra Nil, in which you terraform a planet then tidy up after yourself, is 30% off; branching strategy-RPG beloved by Sin and others, Wildermyth, likewise.
</p>
<p>My edict up top is simple: either video games should offer me the fantasy of attainable closure within my busy life, or they should offer me a pressure-free sandpit as a salve from the deadlines of life. Anything else may as well be a job. I'm being facetious, obviously, but only slightly. Minecraft and Fall Guys and Helldivers 2 are the sand currently residing between my toes, and I'd happily play any of them for another several years. I probably will.
</p>
<p>You can check out all the discounts and demos for the Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/endlessly_replayable">over on Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>
A group of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/x-com">XCOM</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/civilization">Civilisation</a> developers have co-founded a new studio, Midsummer Studios, who plan to “revitalise the life sim genre” with their debut release. The latter doesn’t have a title yet, and is described as “a next-gen Life Sim that emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” According to former XCOM and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns">Marvel’s Midnight Suns</a> director Jake Solomon, it’s “focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Midsummer’s other founders are Grant Rodiek, who spent 18 years at Maxis as a producer and director on The Sims, and Will Miller, former lead designer of Civilisation: Beyond Earth and former lead engineer of Midnight Suns. Nelsie Birch, meanwhile, is new to games: she hails from the world of municipal government and public finance, which sounds like it’ll stand her in good stead as the fledgling studio’s chief operational officer.
</p>
<p>
Midsummer Studios have funding from Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, F4 Fund, Krafton, Day Zero Productions and Transcend Fund. The latter’s founding partner Shanti Bergel used to be a producer on The Sims, and has “an abiding respect for how hard it is to deliver the alchemy of community, systems design, gameplay, and user generated content necessary” to create a good life sim.
</p>
<p>
So what is this life sim, exactly? Going by Solomon’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">recent chat with Eurogamer’s Katharine Castle</a> (RPS in peace), it’ll be a lot like The Sims, but with a greater emphasis on players composing stories they can share in some fashion. "We do play The Sims here because there are so many things that it does really well," Solomon told Katharine – good old Katharine, as I used to call her, before she levelled up and left us all alone with that awful Graham. “And when you've got a team of largely ex-Firaxis developers, some of whom have never worked on or played a life sim before, ‘I was like, 'Oh my god, you've gotta play The Sims'. There's no way you won't play [that] without laughing and being like, 'Oh, this is a very joyful game." 
</p>
<p>
By the sounds of things, the game will take place in a small town, these being "very rich storytelling environments", in Solomon’s analysis. Inspirations include Stephen King novels, Gilmore Girls, Touched By An Angel and Midsomer Murders. So, a small town that plays host to both cross-generational bantz and scares of the supernatural variety? Solomon adds that "there's a reason why small towns work really well, because you can establish that everybody's got these almost incestuous relationships. So if you do something here, it's going to come back to you here." 
</p>
<p>
You’ll start by creating a character and choosing a story theme, such as finding romance, which feeds into a brace of major and minor storylines. The developers want outcomes to be entirely open-ended, and the underlying town simulation is designed to spin on forever, throwing up new scenarios. There’s also a Creative mode for the more capricious life simmer and/or people whose first smalltown soap opera was Wandavision. This lets you instantly edit a character’s appearance, mood, relationships and personality. 
</p>
<p>Lest the above seem out of synch with Solomon's previous work, he's been thinking about life sims for some time. Katharine picked his brain on the subject last April, before she left us in the lurch with Nic and his appalling trombone obsessions. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jake-solomon-interview-gdc-2023">the digested version of that conversation</a>, in which Solomon reflects on the sins of Midnight Suns (whose life simmy aspects are among its least-liked features), and here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jake-solomon-uncut-heres-our-post-firaxis-gdc-interview-in-full">the full unedited Q&amp;A for RPS supporters</a>.</p>

            <p>The only thing I’ve stuck to regularly over the last twelve years is breathing, and I often forget to do even that. So it’s with all the awe and appreciation in the world that I dove into the demo for retro <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whispers-in-the-moss">Whispers In The Moss</a>. It's been in development for twelve years, from solo dev <a href="https://unculturedgames.itch.io/">Uncultured Games</a>. It's set in a vaguely ancient Rome-inspired fantasy world brought to life through intricate and inventive ASCII, and scored with homages to the classics. Ah, but how does it play? You exclaim with evident interest, I assume.</p>

<p>Pretty smoothly, honestly! I’ve got basically no experience navigating something quite this Commodore-ified, to the point where I’m sure I’ve already alienated a few of you by wrongly calling the coding language ‘Commodore-ified’. But it’s all instantly intuitive with on-screen key commands for the various menus. Intuitive enough, in fact, that I’m immediately able to both hold a conversation <em>and</em> collect some garlic. Chat and a bulb! What else can you want? Fancy popping over for a chat and a bulb? You could say to someone, and they’d be a fool to decline.</p>
<figure>

</iframe> </p>
</figure>
<p>I’m impressed by the detail on display in the starting village. I’m not quite nostalgic enough for this era to make the staring faces of my party from the menu read as anything else than deeply surreal, but it’s still a cosy place to be.  I visit some random houses I’m not invited to, as is traditional, and one dweller steals a single gold piece from me every time I talk to him. I natter with some pirates, one bloke threatens me for stepping on his tomato patch, and I figure it’s time to find something to fight.</p>
<p>The party and I take a raft to an island I’m told is filled with pirates. I go up to the first sprite, which turns out not to be a pirate, but instead some sort of gigantic monkey holding a terrifyingly massive club. Luckily, one of my mates has the ability to cast ‘gun’ on this thing. We pop off a few shots, then burn it to death with fire magic. Throughout this, the runaway synth bass does a great job convincing me that, yes, I am truly burning a giant monkey to death.</p>

</figure>
<p>I’d like to play more! The lovely thing about this kind of homage to a bygone era is that Whispers In The Moss retains a tantalising sense of inscrutability. That’s despite it being, as I’ve said, pretty easy to wrap your head around. Still, even if there’s not more than meets the eye here, it’s still a very perky and worthwhile bit of JRPG. You can find the demo on Itch <a href="https://unculturedgames.itch.io/whispers-in-the-moss">here</a>.</p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-waiting-years-for-its-next-gen-update-fallout-4-is-already-getting-another-patch-next-week">promised and/or threatened</a>, depending on your perspective, open world game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> has gotten some <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/0xBHwy048KMmWqzKkrknu/fallout-4-next-gen-update-2-notes">new graphics tweaks and bug fixes</a> to smooth out the bumps caused by its previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">“next gen update”</a>. The update broke a bunch of mods, delayed a few interesting overhaul projects like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout London</a>, and generally made everyone shake their fists at the sky and shout “Howaaaard!” Remember folks: auteur theory unduly credits a single creative for a group effort - the dice that Todd rolls every time he decides whether or not to break the game are also clearly to blame here.</p>

<p>Here are the ‘Patch Highlights’ - mostly console bits, mind you:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 Display Settings</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, we’ve been able to implement the ability to control your graphic fidelity and performance. We highly recommend you run with the default settings but now you can change your options to better fit your playstyle and display.</p>
<p><strong>Frame Rate Target</strong></p>
<p>Frame Rate Target allows you to choose between 30, 40, and 60 (default). It is important to note that to select 40, your display must be able to support 120hz.</p>
<p><strong>Visual and Performance Prioritization</strong></p>
<p>You can now choose between Visuals and Performance (default) while trying to maintain frame rate target. If you choose Frame Rate Target of 60, we recommend selecting Performance. Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier.</p>
<p>Please note both modes can only be changed from the main menu.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are the PC-relevant bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>General stability improvements</li>
<li>Fixed visual issue with certain imagespaces</li>
<li>Fixed issue with character name field when in widescreen mode. (PC)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that occasionally caused bundles to not fully download and could cause a crash</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with material swaps</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause the Creation Club menu to not appear (Microsoft Store)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>All I can add is that I hope this ends terribly and Beth have to drop a third patch that does even stupider things. Not that I don’t want players to have a good time with the game they bought, I just want to see Girlfriend Reviews <a href="https://youtu.be/js5sX5oKPTA?t=119">write another song</a> about it.</p>

            <p>
I've played little of legendary survival sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a>, or The Short Dark, as I guess it has proven for me. I fell off the game after succumbing to my first wolf. But I've sampled enough to know that adding a "Misery Mode" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.
</p>
<p>
It's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All of the above is coming in part five of the game's Tales From The Far Territory expansion, alongside a new Mountain Pass area and a new Tale that wraps up the Rüdiger storyline from Signal Void and Buried Echoes. The Misery Mode is aimed particularly at people who do well in The Long Dark's Interloper difficulty. Here's a freshly charred chunk of devlog from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/4175477072262710274?l=english">developer overview on Steam</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
We've been working on a new Experience Mode, specifically made for Interloper players who have maxed out that mode and are looking for a new level of challenge. Misery takes Interloper and ratchets up the difficulty by adding six new Afflictions that are applied over time. The purpose is to survive in the mode for as long as possible after all six Afflictions have come in, and while we're not 100% sure yet as the mode is still being playtested (with some help from some of our Interloper players from the community), we suspect the Days Survived counts will be in the dozens and not the hundreds like some existing Interloper players are able to achieve. Just trying to keep the game fresh and challenging for a group of players in our community who really like punishment! Of course, this mode isn't for everyone.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Also not for everyone, the Cougar, which is such a nuisance they're adding an individual setting to turn it off. It's a highly territorial beast that will become "interested in you" if you spend a while in one region. The cougar will then move in, establish a den and claim a stretch of ground as its territory. 
</p>
<p>
"You'll have plenty of warning before they move in, and plenty of warning once they have occupied a region," the developers explain. "What you won't get is plenty of warning before they attack you, once they are encroaching on your territory (or you on theirs)! So pay attention to the warning signs, move around the world and be prepared with a second Safehouse location in a different region, and you'll be OK."

The Cougar is a vicious customer in combat - its attacks boast a brand new Affliction. Worse, if you let it escape it'll continue to hunt you later, but you can fend it off for an extended period if you find and destroy its den using noisemakers. "We think the Cougar will keep players on edge, and keep things interesting for those who are looking for a good long-term challenge, while also giving players the info they need to avoid Cougars altogether if that's what they prefer," the devs conclude.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, there's the Cheat Death System. "This is the first change to our permadeath system that we've ever made in the game, and we hope it brings a new dimension to gameplay for those of our players who just aren't ready to lose their favourite survivor, or those who just want something fresh," the developers write. "We'd love to see players get into the spirit of this and give it a try instead of backing up their saves and continuing without consequences." Here's how it works: if you decide to Cheat Death, you'll be offered "a series of tradeoffs", because the Grim Reaper must have his morsel of flesh. 
</p>
<p>
On respawning, you'll also lose a few items from your pack, which you'll have to retrieve, but the world will be otherwise as you left it, "including resources and gear items you have stored in your favourite locations, places you have explored and looted, surveying progress, Tales completion progress, etc". The game will become harder every time you cheat death, presumably as a result of the aforementioned trade-offs, and your fourth "life" is your final chance. So maybe try to avoid perishing regardless.

<p>The Long Dark remains one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games on PC</a> - the 28th best, to be precise.

            <p>Greek god pulverizing simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> is getting its first patch "later this month", say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work. We don't know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer's "distinct style". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's important to us that Melinoë have her own distinct style," say Supergiant in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072251730219?l=english">an update post</a>,
"and for players to be able to navigate her battles and other interactions in a nimble, responsive, expressive way. We have ideas for how to improve her Dash and Sprint."</p>
<p>Interesting. I enjoy how the movement feels so far, that's clear from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>. Right now, you have to hold the dash button down to make Melinoë sprint, and release the button to stop sprinting. If I had the big hat that said "in charge of Greek god design" on it, I'd maybe make Melinoë's sprint occur automatically after a dash, and cut it off as soon as she performs any other move. Then again, these are easy things to say, and it's not even clear if it's a control issue the studio is concerned about. Also, I am not in the studio, looking at reams of hefty player data. So I'll take off my big fake hat now.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's set to be a Supergiant update but not a super-giant update, if you get what I mean. Other "enhancements and fixes" are coming, the developers say. Like I've mentioned, one planned change is an alteration to resource gathering. </p>
<p>"We want Hades II players to focus on goals that are important to them," they say, "though don't want resource gathering to feel too frustrating, such as if you didn't bring the right gathering tool along for the ride."</p>
<p>That might mean some way to swap tools during runs, or the ability to carry multiple tools. Normally, once you've chosen a tool you're locked-in to having that tool the whole run. For example, if you pick the fishing rod but then see a ton of digging spots where the spade would have been handy, you might feel some seed-based FOMO. An ability to swap tools mid-run, or to pair tools, might be welcome. But as with the dashing change, we don't know the studio's exact plans. I am but a lowly oracle. Look deeply into my pool and you will see the fates send only ripples. </p>
